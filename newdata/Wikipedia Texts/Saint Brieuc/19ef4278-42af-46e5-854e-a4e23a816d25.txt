Stade Briochin

Stade Briochin, founded in 1904, are a French association football team based in Saint-Brieuc, France, who are currently playing in the Championnat National 2, the fifth tier in the French football league system. They play at the Stade Fred Aubert in Saint-Brieuc, which can hold 11,000 fans.
They have played for the majority of their existence at the amateur levels of the French football league system, but did spend three seasons in the second tier of the professional league during the period 1993–1997, before suffering liquidation and an enforced relegation to CFA 2.


== History ==
Until 1959, Stade Briochin competed in the Ligue de Bretagne, the regional amateur league of Brittany. For five of the next ten years they contested the Championnat de France Amateur, which at the time was the top tier of Amateur football. They competed around this level, as the French football league system restructured itself, until 1988 when they were relegated from the Ligue de Bretagne Division Honneur (the fifth tier, in effect, at this stage) to the Ligue de Bretagne Division Supérieure Régionale.
From the 1988–89 season, the club won promotions in three out of four seasons, and in 1993–94 they finished 6th in Division 2, which is still their highest finish to date.
In the 1996–97 season, the club started to suffer from debt issues, and on 24 March 1997 they were liquidated by order of court and administratively relegated from the professional football league.The club restarted in Championnat de France Amateur 2 for the 1997–98 season, falling to the Ligue de Bretagne Division Honneur (now the sixth tier) in 2008 and further to the Ligue de Bretagne Division Supérieure Élite (seventh tier) in 2011. Successive promotions in 2012 and 2013 brought the club back to CFA 2.

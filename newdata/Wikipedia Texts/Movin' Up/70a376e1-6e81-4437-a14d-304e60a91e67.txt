== Reception ==
Writing for Allmusic, Jim Worbois described the album as "a nice LP of light, enjoyable, pop songs."
Renown music critic Robert Christgau said "If you're really committed to the 'fun' only unpretentious pop can provide, you might as well go directly to these proud posers, who generate hooks in an abundance that will shame whatever 'authentic' locals you retain a sentimental yen for. Connoisseurs of pop plasticity will get an additional kick out of how affectlessly they shift from the usual ersatz teen romance to equally meaningless and equally commercial outlaw and rebel themes. Plus an uncanny Beatle impression on 'It's So Hard.' B- "
Ira Robbins wrote: "Movin' Up traverses a panoply of mildly bent styles, from mock-Stray Cats ("Fire in the City") to Dave Edmunds-ish nostalgia ("Hey Tina") to Anglo-pop ("Hidden in a Heartbeat") to countryfied rock ("Santa Fe") and much more. Sure, they futz around a lot (especially onstage), but their silliness never interferes with the serious task of playing catchy pop with maximum gusto. It may not have meant a lot, but the first album is truly mega-fun."
The Rolling Stone review said: "The band's debut LP is a twelve track instant party that's more fun than a garbage pail full of vodka and Gatorade."

Caragh River

The River Caragh is a river in County Kerry in southwestern Ireland.
The river is relatively unpolluted and its catchment area of about 66 square miles (170 km2)  comes under the protection of a Special Area of Conservation ("Killarney National Park, MacGillycuddy's Reeks and Caragh River Catchment").
This is one area in which the rare Kerry Slug is known to occur.

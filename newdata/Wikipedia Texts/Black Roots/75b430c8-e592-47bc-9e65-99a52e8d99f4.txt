Black Roots (film)

Black Roots is the fourth feature-length film produced and directed by American independent filmmaker Lionel Rogosin. The film gathers a number of African-American folk and blues musicians in a room, where they share stories and songs about the black experience in America. Film editor Carl Lerner is credited as an "associate producer"; and Alan Lomax, along with his daughter Anna, are credited as "musical consultants." Anna Lomax also has the credit of "assistant editor." 
Lionel Rogosin would reunite with Jim Collier two years later for his next film, Black Fantasy.

Applehead (candy)

Lemonhead is an American brand of candy, first introduced in 1962, produced by the Ferrara Candy Company. Lemonheads are a round, lemon-flavored candy consisting of a sweet coating, soft sour shell, and a hard candy core. Popular varieties are Grapeheads, Cherryheads and Appleheads.Inspiration for the Lemonhead name came from Salvatore Ferrara seeing his grandson, Salvatore II, the third generation, after delivery. Salvatore II was a forceps baby and he noted that his new grandson's head was lemon-shaped.
The candy was born out of the same cold panned process as the company's Red Hots in 1962. They are most commonly sold in their standard 1 centimeter size, but are also produced in a single-sale 3 cm version. Ferrara now makes 500 million Lemonheads per year.Some time between the 1980s and late 1990s, Ferrara Pan brought all of their fruit-flavored candies under a consistent naming convention: Lemonheads, Grapeheads (formerly Alexander the Grape), Cherryheads (formerly Cherry Chan/Cherry Clan) and Appleheads (formerly Johnny Apple Treats).

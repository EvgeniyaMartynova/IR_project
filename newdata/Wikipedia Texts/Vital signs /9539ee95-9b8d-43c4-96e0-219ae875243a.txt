Also, a live version of "Vital Signs" appeared as the B-side to Rush's "New World Man" single in 1982 (Mercury #76179, US edition).It has appeared in Rush's set lists as recently as the 2010-2011 Time Machine Tour (documented on Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland), during which Moving Pictures was played in its entirety.

Vital Signs (Survivor album)

Vital Signs is the fifth studio album by American rock band Survivor and their first with vocalist Jimi Jamison released on August 1, 1984. The album was their second most successful in the U.S., reaching #16 on the Billboard Album charts and being certified platinum by the RIAA. This album includes the singles "I Can't Hold Back", "High on You", "The Search Is Over" and "First Night." Outside of the singles, the other songs on Vital Signs keep up with the effective formula.
This is one of the very few studio albums that remained commercially available by Volcano Entertainment after they took a great deal of their releases out of print in August 2009. Rock Candy Records also remastered the content of Vital Signs and reissued it in 2010, adding "The Moment of Truth" (from The Karate Kid soundtrack) as a bonus track.

== Career ==
Craig began his career at the end of the 1980s with Partick Thistle, making a dozen league appearances for The Jags before joining East Stirlingshire in 1991. Spending three years with The Shire, Craig won a move to Scottish Premier Division side Dundee United in 1994, making his league debut in November as a substitute. Craig's next league appearance came in February, and although he started a further three league matches, Craig appeared in only one matchday squad following the side's relegation, joining Hamilton Academical in September 1995.
After a year with Hamilton, Craig joined Kirkcaldy side Raith Rovers, returning to Hamilton after one season. Again, Craig spent a year with Accies before beginning a six-year stint with Ayr United, where his time included finishing as Scottish First Division runners-up and League Cup runners-up in the early 2000s. In 2004, Craig moved to Queen of the South in the era of captain  Jim Thomson. Craig spent a year in Dumfries, scoring once against Partick, before a short spell with Brechin City.
Returning to Partick in 2005, Craig was part of the side that won the First Division play-offs in 2005–06, winning promotion. He scored once in their promotion campaign against Stirling Albion. Instead of joining Thistle in the First Division, Craig moved to Dumbarton, spending two years with The Sons. After short spells with junior club Arthurlie and Montrose, and a trial with Stranraer, he joined Elgin City in 2009. Craig now plays for Maryhill juniors.

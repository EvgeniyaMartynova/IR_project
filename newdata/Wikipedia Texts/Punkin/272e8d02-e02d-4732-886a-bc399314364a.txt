Punkin' Puss & Mushmouse

Punkin' Puss & Mushmouse is a cartoon produced by Hanna-Barbera and originally aired as a segment on The Magilla Gorilla Show.


== Plot ==
The show features a hillbilly cat called Punkin' Puss (voiced by Allan Melvin) who lives in a house in the woods of the southern US. Punkin' is preoccupied with a hillbilly mouse called Mushmouse (voiced by Howard Morris) who lives there too, and Punkin' frequently tries to shoot him with his rifle.
The "Nowhere Bear" has Punkin' Puss continually disrupting an angry bear's sleep. The episode "Small Change" has Punkin' Puss (and later a dog as well) shrinking to mouse size.
Usually one of Mushmouse's cousins comes and gives Punkin' Puss a hard time. Many would think Punkin' Puss would stop bullying Mushmouse when this occurs but to no avail on Mushmouse's behalf when the relative leaves.

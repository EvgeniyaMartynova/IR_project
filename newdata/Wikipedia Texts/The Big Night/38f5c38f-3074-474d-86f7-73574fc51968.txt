== Plot ==
Police kill two fleeing criminals while a third escapes. A briefcase tossed from their car's window into a canal is recovered by a young man, Frankie, who discovers it includes the loot from a bank robbery: $209,000.
Frankie confides in girlfriend Ellie, whose mother has expressed worry about her dating a young hoodlum. Ellie can't persuade Frankie to do the honest thing and return the money, which he hides. Carl Farrow, the remaining bank robber, begins trying to find out who's got it, as does Wegg, a corrupt cop.
Following the boy, Wegg tries to cut himself in on a deal with Farrow, who instead slugs him and leaves him in the canal, dead. Frightened after finding the body, Frankie decides to turn himself and the case in to the police. Farrow comes gunning for him but Frankie survives, then hopes for leniency from the law.

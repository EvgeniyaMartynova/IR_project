Chesney says that "This is a fun song. It’s every little girl’s fairy tale – and for some, it even does come true. But it’s not all happily ever after. That line, ‘All her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top / But she knows you don’t get where you’re going unless you got something they ain’t got…,’ I love that because it shows you that you can make it in spite of other people refusing to believe in your dream."

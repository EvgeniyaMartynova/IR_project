Marchin' Already

Marchin' Already is the third album by Ocean Colour Scene.
The album was a follow-up to the successful Moseley Shoals, and is in a similar style. The songs were taken from the band's catalogue that they had built up since forming several years earlier.
The single "Hundred Mile High City" was used in the film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Nodding a reference to northern soul, P.P. Arnold appears on "Traveller's Tune" and "It's a Beautiful Thing". A more subdued version of "Traveller's Tune" originally appeared as a B-side to "The Day We Caught the Train".
The album knocked Oasis' Be Here Now off the top spot in the UK Albums Chart—Noel Gallagher sent Ocean Colour Scene his congratulations through a plaque on which he had inscribed, "To The Second Best Band In Britain". Steve Cradock famously retorted "it's an honour to be described as Britain's second best band, ahead of Oasis but behind the Beatles".In 2007 the song "Get Blown Away" was covered by British indie band The Enemy as a B-side to their single "It's Not OK", albeit just a piano and vocal version.
On 4 February 2014, Marchin' Already was reissued as a two disc deluxe version, with the second disc containing B-sides from previous singles. There is also a three disc/one DVD super deluxe version with added demos and radio sessions on Disc 2 and a live concert from the Marchin' Already tour from the Manchester Apollo on 22/02/1998, with the original released VHS of their concert from Stirling Castle making up the DVD release.

Gangsta Party (Joe Budden song)

"Gangsta Party" is a song by Joe Budden, featuring Nate Dogg and produced by Scott Storch. It was supposed be the first single from Joe Budden's intended second album The Growth which was supposed to be released in June 2005.

 Continued disagreements between Budden and Def Jam forced the two sides to part ways.

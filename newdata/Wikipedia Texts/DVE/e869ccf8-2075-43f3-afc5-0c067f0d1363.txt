== History ==

The station has aired rock music since 1969, when it was owned by ABC. Previously, it was known as KQV-FM and simulcasted then-sister station KQV. The new programming was a tape service of a freeform rock format entitled "Love", created by ABC official Allen Shaw designed specifically for airing on the 7 FM stations owned by ABC. Shaw changed the format from the automated "Love" format to live free form album rock in 1970. The station's current call letters were chosen in December 1970 at the height of the "hippie" era. "DVE" was derived from "dove", the bird of peace. In the fall of 1971, Shaw, along with ABC Radio programming executive Bob Henaberry, replaced the freeform rock programming with the very first album rock "format", playing only the best cuts from the best selling rock albums with minimal disc jockey talk. WDVE was the most successful FM radio station in Pittsburgh throughout the 1970s. In early print marketing, the phrase "Rock'n Stereo WDVE 102.5" was set in white text against a black oval background surrounded by vivid rainbow-like colors. Later, the logo was rendered in white and yellow with red accents against a black background, generally using the slogan "DVE Rocks."
Starting in the 1980s, the station started playing the Beat Farmers song Happy Boy every Friday around 3 p.m. at the start of the afternoon drive time shift to signal the end of the work week and the start of the weekend.  On Fridays at noon, they air a recording of the band KISS saying; "Hey yinz guys! It's FRIDAY!!", immediately followed by "Rock and Roll All Nite".
Radio personality and WEBN alum Maxwell Slater "Max" Logan (Ben Bornstein), formerly heard on WMMS, WNCX in Cleveland and now on WLUP-FM in Chicago as host of The Maxwell Show, spent time at WDVE in the mid-1990s.The station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., and (along with WBGG) serves as the flagship radio station of the Pittsburgh Steelers radio network. For years, it was the home for Pittsburgh Penguins hockey (WXDX-FM is the current flagship), promoting itself with such oddities as a young Jaromir Jagr reading the morning weather forecast in heavily accented English during his suspension from the NHL.
Because of the station having a largely male audience, the station refers to fellow iHeartMedia, Inc. stations WXDX-FM and WPGB as "brother" stations as opposed to the more commonly used term "sister" station, since WXDX-FM also has a predominantly male audience and all three have younger listeners. In recent years, the station's format has gradually drifted towards classic rock, with current releases rarely incorporated into the playlist, though some recent songs such as Ozzy Osbourne's 2007 hit I Don't Wanna Stop are played on the station (Osbourne himself is a fixture on many classic rock stations). Pittsburgh had been without a full-time classic rock station since the flip of WRRK to adult hits, even though WDVE's parent company Clear Channel considers the station as a classic rocker; however, since 2016, WDVE has added more newer rock tracks that were not being played on co-owned WXDX, with the station gradually shifting to a more Mainstream Rock direction.

In 1876, the I.N. Parlier family migrated from Springfield, Illinois to the present site of Parlier. The family's name, and City's namesake, was derived from DeParlier, their French ancestry. The Parlier family's General Store, Trading Post and Post Office became the center of town. Small, family run wheat farms were initially cultivated in the area. Wheat soon gave way to grapes, raisins and tree fruit, foods that Parlier continues to produce today for the world food market. Improved irrigation systems and arrival of the railroad helped Parlier establish itself as a hub among surrounding communities.

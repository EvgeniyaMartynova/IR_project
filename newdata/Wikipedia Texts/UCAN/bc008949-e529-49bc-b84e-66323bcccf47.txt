United Coalition for Animals

United Coalition for Animals or UCAN is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2001 with the purpose of providing spay/neuter as a solution to pet overpopulation. UCAN made the decision in 2005 to open a Cincinnati-based spay/neuter clinic with the express purpose of offering high-quality, affordable spay/neuter surgeries to targeted low-income communities in the 12-county Greater Cincinnati region, After two years, thousands of volunteer hours and a successful capital campaign, UCAN opened its non-profit Spay Neuter Clinic in Cincinnati's Queensgate area on April 16, 2007. Since that date, the clinic has provided over 67,000 spay/neuter surgeries, preventing hundreds of thousands of unwanted dogs and cats from being born into abuse, neglect and ultimate euthanasia. UCAN utilizes a combination of low-cost service, accessibility and education to reach those pets that would not otherwise have been spayed or neutered.
UCAN has the advantage of following the proven model of the Humane Alliance Spay/Neuter Clinic in Asheville, North Carolina. One of the most successful programs in the country, Humane Alliance has reduced the euthanasia rate in greater Asheville by more than 82% in the last decade,  and they are committed to sharing their expertise by helping other clinics get started. Humane Alliance has partnered with PetSmart Charities and the Humane Society of the United States to form the 
National Spay Neuter Response Team (NSNRT). NSNRT is a strategic training program designed to assist organizations as they open and operate high-volume, targeted, affordable, spay/neuter clinics across the nation. UCAN has been accepted into the NSNRT program  and receives guidance from this team.
 
UCAN also has the benefit of operating a non-profit home furnishings consignment store, Pedigree Interiors. All proceeds from Pedigree Interiors support UCANâ€™s spay/neuter initiative. In its first three years of operation, the store has earned a profit of over $999,000, and business continues to grow. More than 50 volunteers donate their time in the store and more than 600 consignors supply merchandise. Not only does Pedigree Interiors raise funds, it also raises awareness by spreading the message of spay/neuter.

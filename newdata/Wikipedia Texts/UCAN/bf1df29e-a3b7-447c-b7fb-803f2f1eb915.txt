Union of Catholic Asian News

The Union of Catholic Asian News (UCAN) is a news agency that covers issues and matters of interest for the Catholic Church on the Asian continent. It was launched in Hong Kong in 1979. Since its foundation, it has become one of the largest Catholic news agencies in the world, as well as the largest in Asia.

UCAN currently operates bureaus in Bangladesh, China, East Timor, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.

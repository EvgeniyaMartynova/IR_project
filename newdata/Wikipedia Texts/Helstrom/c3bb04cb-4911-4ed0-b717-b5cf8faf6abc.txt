Helstrom metric

In mathematics, in the area of quantum information geometry, the Bures metric (named after Donald Bures) or Helstrom metric (named after Carl W. Helstrom) defines an infinitesimal distance between density matrix operators defining quantum states. It is a quantum generalization of the Fisher information metric, and is identical to the Fubini–Study metric when restricted to the pure states alone.


== Definition ==
The metric may be defined as

  
    
      
        [
        d
        (
        ρ
        ,
        ρ
        +
        d
        ρ
        )
        
          ]
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        
          
            tr
          
        
        (
        d
        ρ
        G
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle [d(\rho ,\rho +d\rho )]^{2}={\frac {1}{2}}{\mbox{tr}}(d\rho G),}
  where 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
   is Hermitian 1-form operator implicitly given by

  
    
      
        ρ
        G
        +
        G
        ρ
        =
        d
        ρ
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho G+G\rho =d\rho ,}
  which is a special case of a continuous Lyapunov equation.
Some of the applications of the Bures metric include that given a target error, it allows the calculation of the minimum number of measurements to distinguish two different states and the use of the volume element as a candidate for the Jeffreys prior  probability density for mixed quantum states.

The Bures distance is the finite version of the infinitesimal square distance described above and is given

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle D_{A}(\rho _{1},\rho _{2})=\arccos {\sqrt {F(\rho _{1},\rho _{2})}},}
  which is a measure of the statistical distance
between quantum states.

  where the quantum Fisher metric (tensor components) is identified as

  
    
      
        
          J

                2
              
            
          
          ]
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle J_{\mu \nu }={\mbox{tr}}\left[\rho {\frac {L_{\mu }L_{\nu }+L_{\nu }L_{\mu }}{2}}\right].}
  The definition of the SLD implies that the quantum Fisher metric is 4 times the Bures metric. In other words, given that 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            μ
            ν
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }}
   are components of the Bures metric tensor, one has

  
    
      
        
          J
          
            μ
            ν
          
          

          
        
        =
        4
        
          g
          
            μ
            ν
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle J_{\mu \nu }^{}=4g_{\mu \nu }.}
  As it happens with the classical Fisher information metric, the quantum Fisher metric can be used to find the Cramér–Rao bound of the covariance.

The actual computation of the Bures metric is not evident from the definition, so, some formulas were developed for that purpose. For 2x2 and 3x3 systems, respectively, the quadratic form of the Bures metric is calculated as

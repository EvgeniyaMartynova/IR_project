==== 2011 season ====
Helu was selected 105th overall in the 2011 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. He would later be joined by Nebraska teammates, DeJon Gomes and Niles Paul, who were drafted after him. On November 6, 2011 in his first career start, Helu broke the Redskins all-time record for receptions in a game with 14 catches, in a loss against the San Francisco 49ers. The following two weeks, in losses to Miami and Dallas, Helu had a combined 14 rushes and 5 receptions as Coach Mike Shanahan split running back duties between Helu and Ryan Torain. Coach Shanahan said, “I like Helu, he’s doing some great things. I don’t want to put too much pressure on him too early. He’s not ready for that. But he’s gaining experience, and I like what I see.”On November 27, 2011, Helu rushed for a Redskins rookie-record 108 yards on 23 carries and a touchdown against the Seattle Seahawks' top-ten ranked run defense. While running for a touchdown, he hurdled Seahawks cornerback, Roy Lewis. He was then named the full-time starter by Coach Shanahan, and responded with two consecutive 100 yard performances. Following his 126-yard performance against the New England Patriots, Helu led all active rookies in rush yards. His streak of three consecutive 100 yard games is the most by any Redskins rookie in franchise history; a record he was unable to extend to four games due to an injury he sustained.
 
At the end of the 2011 NFL season, Helu was Redskins' leader in rushing yards.
On January 16, 2012, Helu along with fellow rookie, Ryan Kerrigan, were named to the Pro Football Weekly/Pro Football Writers of America all-rookie team.


==== 2012 season ====
After the NFL changed the rule in 2012 to allow players' jerseys to include generational titles in their names, Helu adopted "Jr." to the back of his jersey. He was expected to compete for the starting spot in the 2012 season against Tim Hightower and Evan Royster, but ended up losing the competition to rookie Alfred Morris. His second season was cut short after being placed on injured reserve on September 26, 2012 due to lower leg injuries and turf toe. He finished the season with two rushing yards and 45 receiving yards on seven receptions.


==== 2013 season ====
Helu returned from injury and secured his place as the second string running back behind Morris during the 2013 preseason. In a 45-41 Week 7 win against the Chicago Bears, he recorded his first multi-scoring game, recording three touchdowns.


==== 2014 season ====
In 2014, Helu had almost no competition for the second-string running back job, and won it easily over fellow running backs Silas Redd, Evan Royster, Chris Thompson, and Lache Seastrunk.

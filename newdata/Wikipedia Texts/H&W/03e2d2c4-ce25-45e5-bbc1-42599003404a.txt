Hartmann & Weiss

Hartmann & Weiss GmbH (H&W) is a Hamburg-based custom sporting firearms maker founded in 1965. They make sporting arms, including shotguns, over and under, falling-block single rifles, and bolt-action rifles based on Mauser 98 and several other modern actions.

== History ==
Otto Weiss was a gunsmith who worked at Merkel in East Germany before fleeing that country in 1958 for England, where he initially worked at Purdey's.  Five years later he relocated to Hamburg to work with Gerhard Hartmann as a custom gunsmith.  In 1964 he and Hartmann founded the company.  Three years later, an associate named Peter Nelson established a second location in England.

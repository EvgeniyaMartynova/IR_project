Uniformly bounded

In mathematics, a uniformly bounded family of functions is a family of bounded functions that can all be bounded by the same constant. This constant is larger than the absolute value of any value of any of the functions in the family.

=== Real line and complex plane ===
Let 

  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
        =
        {
        
          f
          
            i
          
        
        :
        X
        →
        K
        ,
        i
        ∈
        I
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}=\{f_{i}:X\to K,i\in I\}}
  be a family of functions indexed by 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
  , where 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is an arbitrary set and 
  
    
      
        K
      
    
    {\displaystyle K}
   is the set of real or complex numbers. We call 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
   uniformly bounded if there exists a real number 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
   such that

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          f
          
            i
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
          |
        
        ≤
        M
        
        ∀
        i
        ∈
        I
        
        ∀
        x
        ∈
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle |f_{i}(x)|\leq M\qquad \forall i\in I\quad \forall x\in X.}
  


=== Metric space ===
In general let 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   be a metric space with metric 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  , then the set

  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
        =
        {
        
          f
          
            i
          
        
        :
        X
        →
        Y
        ,
        i
        ∈
        I
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}=\{f_{i}:X\to Y,i\in I\}}
  is called uniformly bounded if there exists an element 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   from 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   and a real number 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
   such that

  
    
      
        d
        (
        
          f
          
            i
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        ,
        a
        )
        ≤
        M
        
        ∀
        i
        ∈
        I
        
        ∀
        x
        ∈
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(f_{i}(x),a)\leq M\qquad \forall i\in I\quad \forall x\in X.}

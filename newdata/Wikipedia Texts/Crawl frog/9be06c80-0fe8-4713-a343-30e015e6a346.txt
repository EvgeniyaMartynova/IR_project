Pygmy crawl frog

Leptolalax oshanensis (Oshan metacarpal-tubercled toad or pigmy crawl frog) is a frog species in the family Megophryidae. It is endemic to southern–central China (Guizhou, Hubei, and Sichuan provinces). Its type locality is Mount Emei (Chinese: 峨嵋山; pinyin: Éméi Shān; Wade–Giles: O2-mei2 Shan1). The same mountain has given the species its name, although this is now obscured because "Oshan" is a contraction of the transliteration that is no longer widely used, Omeishan. It has also been reported from Thailand and Laos but these are now considered to represent Leptolalax minimus.Its natural habitats are temperate forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and rivers. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN.Leptolalax oshanensis is a small frog: males grow to a snout-vent length of about 28 mm (1.1 in) and females to 32 mm (1.3 in).

== History ==
In prehistory, several Hill forts surrounded Villaviciosa, most located in the axis of the ria, near Rodiles. During the time of the Kingdom of Asturias in the 8th century, the population migrated to areas such as Amandi, Camoca, and Bedriñana, appearing frequently in the Maliayo territory.
By the time of Alfonso IX of León, in the 13th century, the municipality had begun to repopulate, as witnessed in 17 October 1270, when King Alfonso X The Wise created the document evidencing the establishment of a population in Buetes. At the same time, a Cistercian Order emerged in the valley of Boides creating the Monasterio de Santa María de Valdediós.
In the 16th century, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V landed and was hosted in the town (the most important event in village history). The King arrived at the port of Tazones due to a storm that altered his course on the way to Santander.
In the 19th century, the town was repeatedly attacked. It was occupied several times by French troops during the Peninsular War. In 1835, the community was officially established and municipal business grew significantly due to its location on the river, which at the time was navigable.

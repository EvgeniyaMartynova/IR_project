Approval rating

In the United States, presidential job approval ratings were introduced by George Gallup in the late 1930s (most likely 1937) to gauge public support for the president of the United States during their term. An approval rating is a percentage determined by a polling which indicates the percentage of respondents to an opinion poll who approve of a particular person or program. Typically, an approval rating is given to a politician based on responses to a poll in which a sample of people are asked whether they approve or disapprove of that particular political figure. A  question might ask:

Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?Like most surveys that predict opinions, individual poll results may be inaccurate. Many unscientific approval rating systems exist that show inaccurate statistics. Examples that self select, such as online questions are of this type. However, the aggregate approval rating is generally accepted by statisticians, as a statistically valid indicator of the comparative changes in the popular United States mood regarding a president. 
In contemporary politics, presidential job approval is highly partisan. Obama in his last year as sitting president achieved a job approval of 70 to 90 among Democrats and 30 to 45 among Republicans, while President Donald Trump in 2018 has a job approval of 85 to 90 among Republicans and 5 to 10 among Democrats. Gallup polling has found that 46% of Americans are either "Democrats or Democratic leaners" while 39% are either "Republicans or Republican leaners".

== Reception ==
Sounds criticized the album as being somewhat nondescript, but praised it for having "a lot of good natured foot-tapping music" and concluded "I certainly find it infinitely preferable to Black Sabbath, and I have the feeling that Budgie might develop into something a lot more interesting."In a brief retrospective review, AllMusic declared that "For those seriously interested in metal's development, bombastic treasures like 'Homicidal Suicidal,' and 'Nude Disintegrating Parachutist Woman' are essential listening."

Budgie the Little Helicopter

Budgie the Little Helicopter is a British series of children's books and animated television series relating to a fictional character 'Budgie' and his friends. The characters were based on the books by Sarah, Duchess of York. The show was coproduced by Fred Wolf Films Dublin, The Sleepy Kids Company and Sarah, Duchess of York for The west version of HTV for ITV and Scottish Television Enterprises, and originally aired on British television in 1994 on CITV, where it ran for 52 episodes and 1 Christmas Television Special, as an ITV Competitor to BBC's Oscar's Orchestra. A range of videos, books, and toys were released under the Budgie label.
On release of the first book, the Duchess was accused by the media of copying the idea for the series from an out-of-print 1960 book Hector the Helicopter, by A.W. Baldwin, which she denied.

=== Aircraft characters ===


==== Main aircraft ====
Budgie the Little Helicopter (voiced by Richard Pearce) — Budgie is a small blue helicopter (that seems to resemble a Bell 206) with a big yellow cap covering his entire airframe and also speaks in Teenage Accent. He lives and works at Harefield Airfield, and he and Pippa are best friends. He can be cheeky and troublesome, but he works hard too, and continuously tries to please Lionel. He will also bravely come to the assistance of people in danger. He hates going through the heli-wash, and avoids doing so whenever he can. A white teddy bear named Snowy can almost always be seen carried in a pocket on Budgie's starboard. His catchphrase is "Rocketing Rotors!"
Pippa the Single-Engined Mono-Plane (voiced by Abigail MacVean)  — Pippa (inspired by a Piper Warrior aircraft) is a small green single-engined monoplane with a tuft of blonde hair and a big pink bow on her top. She was the second aircraft to arrive at Harefield Airfield, and at first, teased Budgie and called him a yo-yo (snail later on). After a race and several comparisons about who was the best, they both became firm friends. She enjoys helping out, and also loves using the heli-wash/plane wash (as opposed to Budgie).
Chuck the American Helicopter (voiced by Kerry Shale) (was stated in the second TV episode as being a Boeing CH-47 Chinook) - is a twin-rotored helicopter. He comes from America and does not understand British English well. He sometimes gets cocky and likes to show off, but this led him to trouble when he disrupted an air show and finished up in a pond. He also has a bad habit of calling Lionel "Captain".
Lionel the Aircraft in Charge (voiced by Jeremy Nicholas) - Lionel is the senior helicopter in the series (influenced by a Westland Lynx). He does not take kindly to Budgie, Pippa, or especially Chuck causing trouble and making themselves nuisances, but he keeps things in order with his patient but firm ways. He insists on cleanliness from all aircraft at all times. His catchphrase is "Juddering joysticks!"

Wally the old Supermarine Walrus

Jasper Jeer-jet. Jasper was a joker to start off and kept on radioing Harefield Airfield pretending there was an emergency, but when he really did need help in a storm, Budgie came to his rescue, and since then Jasper has realised it is not a good idea to play the fool all the time.

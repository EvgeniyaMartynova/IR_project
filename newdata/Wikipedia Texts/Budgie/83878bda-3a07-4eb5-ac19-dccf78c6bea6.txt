Budgie (desktop environment)

Budgie is a desktop environment that uses GNOME technologies such as GTK+ (> 3.x) and is developed by the Solus project as well as by contributors from numerous communities such as Arch Linux, Manjaro and Ubuntu Budgie. Budgie's design emphasizes simplicity and elegance.


== Applications ==

Budgie desktop tightly integrates with the GNOME stack, employing underlying technologies to offer an alternative desktop experience. Budgie applications generally use GTK and header bars similar to GNOME applications. Budgie builds what is effectively a Favorites list automatically as the user works, moving categories and applications toward the top of menus when they are used.


== History ==

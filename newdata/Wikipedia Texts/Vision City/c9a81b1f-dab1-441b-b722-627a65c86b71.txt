== History ==
In 2011 Ultimate Develops formed and the same year announced Vision City to be their first project. The project, which is being financed by the Rwanda Social Security Board(RSSB), is designed to be built in 4 phases over 8 years and provide housing for 22,000 people. The project is located in Gaculiro, Kinyiya sector in Kigali's Gasabo District.  The tract of land for the entire project is 158 hectares.  Before work could begin 3000 residents were relocated, some of whom had to be forcibly removed.Work began on the project in November 2013. The first phase consists of 504 units aimed at high-income earners.   This has caused some criticism due to the Kigali's need for low-income housing.  After missing the original completion date of mid-August 2016, the first phase was finished by July 2017 with around 30% initial occupancy. Shortly after completion of phase one, the developers dramatically reduced prices on all units, citing cost savings due to government incentives and infrastructure support.According to the developers, the next planned construction phase is a "Town Centre" including of stores, restaurants, banking, and educational services.

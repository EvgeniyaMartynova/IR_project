Buddhabhadra (translator)

Buddhabhadra (simplified Chinese: 佛陀跋陀罗; traditional Chinese: 佛陀跋陀羅; pinyin: Fótuóbátuóluó) (359-429 CE) was an Nepalese Buddhist monk, with the title of śramaṇa. He is most known for his prolific translation efforts of Buddhist texts from Sanskrit into Chinese, and was responsible for the first Chinese translation of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra (Flower Ornament Scripture) in the 5th century.Buddhabhadra and his Chinese disciple Xuangao are known to have advocated the twin principles of samadhi (meditative concentration) and prajñā (wisdom). These were later inherited by the Tiantai school of Buddhism, and its patriarchs Nanyue Huisi and Zhiyi. Buddhabhadra's views in turn stemmed from those of Buddhasena's dhyāna school in Kashmir and their meditation manual was translated by Buddhabhadra at behest of Huiyuan, the founder of the Chinese tradition of Pure Land Buddhism. This Nepali meditation manual preserved in Taishō Tripiṭaka 618, and is typically called the Yogācārabhūmi Sūtra or the Dharmatrātadhyāna Sutra. This text was later prized by the Chan Buddhism in China, and parts of its lineage to the Buddha became entangled in sectarian conflicts between factions of Chinese Buddhism.

Yaakov Yechezkia Greenwald II

Rabbi Yaakov Yehezkiya Greenwald (born April 17, 1948) is an American Rebbe, the current leader of the Pupa Hasidic sect in the United States.


== Biography ==
Born in Antwerp, as the second son of Rabbi Yosef Greenwald, the last rabbi of PÃ¡pa before the Holocaust, and his second wife, Miriam. He was circumcised by his father and as a Sandek was honored Rabbi Chaim Meir Yechiel Shapira of Narol. He was named after his Grandfather Rav Yaakov Yechezkiya Greenwald (the "Vayaged Yaakov"). As a child, the family emigrated to the United States where his father founded the Pupa Hasidus.
Married to Bracha Frieda, the daughter of Rabbi Meir Greenwald, Av Beit Din of Tetch, his father-in-law was the cousin of his father, son of Rabbi Avraham Yosef Greenwald and grandson of Rabbi Moshe Greenwald.
For many years he served as Dayan and Posek of the Pupa Hasidism, and since his father's death on August 11, 1984, he serves as the third Admor of Pupa's Hasidim.
Most of his followers live in the United States (mainly New York) and Canada, and a few in Israel and London.
The Rebbe, unlike his chassidim, wears  a Bekishe all week, on weekdays a flat hat (pictured), and on Shabbos a Shtreimel.
Until recently (2017) The Rebbe used to be the Mohel for his followers' newborn sons. Nowadays he serves as Sandek.
Every summer the Pupa Rebbe harvests wheat in Yuma, Arizona to be used in Passover matzah.
In October 2010, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo visited the Pupa Rebbe.

He also said that the band wrote about thirty potential songs for the album before selecting the eleven included in the final release.Austin Winkler revealed that the album is reflecting of “a really, really dark drug binge.” He added, “I think you can definitely hear the turmoil in my voice. As soon as we got the record done I went into treatment to get help, and it’s interesting to go back and listen to it now. Coming back, I have a whole new look on all of them and they mean something completely different to me now, too, so it’s pretty cool. That’s the beauty of music.”

Move Your Body (Eiffel 65 song)

"Move Your Body" is a song by Italian group Eiffel 65. It was released as the third single from their album Europop, on 30 November 1999.


== Composition and critical reception ==
"Move Your Body" is a bubblegum techno and disco song played in D minor at a 130 BPM. It has dance-oriented sounds and uses the same pitch-shifter based distortion as the vocals from the previous single, "Blue (Da Ba Dee)". Group member Jeffrey Jey claimed that the song "had tried to recall the original spirit of the dance, understood as a vehicle to bring together and communicate with people."Entertainment Weekly said in a review of Europop that "Move Your Body" was hard to be called a "timeless masterpiece," but was impossible to hate it. The song was included on SputnikMusic's review of the album as an example of Eiffel 65's poor ability at writing lyrics. Billboard called it a "kitschy electronic number" and commented on "the song's catchy melody, addictive lyrical redundancy, and the familiar computerized voice of the trio's Jeffrey Jey".


== Commercial performance ==
The single was licensed to several labels for international release; In the UK it was licensed to Warner Music Group's Eternal label, in the US to Universal Music Group's Republic, in Germany to BMG Berlin, in France to Scorpio, in Spain to Blanco y Negro, in Australia to Central Station, and to Valentine and Avex in Southeast Asia.The song achieved huge success in many countries, topping the charts of Austria, Denmark, France, Italy and Spain. However it could only chart at #36 on the Billboard Top 40 Mainstream, which was a disappointment compared to the #2 placing of its predecessor.
Elia Habib, an expert of the French charts, noted the great efficiency of the song on the SNEP chart, since it was strong enough to dislodge the massive hit "Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit Of...)" and to resist to its competitors, which prevented Eiffel 65 to remain a one-hit wonder, and enabled the band to become the first one to get its second number one single in France.


== Music video ==

The music video is sort of a sequel to the music video for "Blue (Da Ba Dee)", as it features the same blue aliens (their leader being named Zorotl). The band has a concert on the planet of the blue aliens, when a group of hostiles capture a female alien. The band (with the help of Zorotl) use a teleportation device to search for her. When they find her, the hostiles join the concert.

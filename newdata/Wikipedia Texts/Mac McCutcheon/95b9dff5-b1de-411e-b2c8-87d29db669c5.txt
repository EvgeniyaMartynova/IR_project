=== Gas tax increase ===
In August 2017, Alabama state senator Arthur Orr (R-Decatur) said he will introduce legislation during the next session, an election year, that would allow local Alabama commissions "to ask voters in their counties to raise a local gasoline tax for specific road projects." The proposal has raised mixed feelings among local officials. Bills to increase the state gas tax have died in recent legislative sessions. McCutcheon stated that while discussions will continue, passing the bill would be unlikely. "In an election year, the reality of getting legislators to vote for any type of revenue measure will be tough," McCutcheon said.

University Credit Union

University Credit Union began as the Boston University Employees' Credit Union, which was founded by a group of Boston University employees May, 1952.  It began with 9 volunteers serving on the Credit Union's first Board of Directors.  Early Board meetings covered matters ranging from the Credit Union's finances and operational issues to sending greetings and wishes to a Credit Union member in the hospital.
It has since merged with Metro Credit Union.

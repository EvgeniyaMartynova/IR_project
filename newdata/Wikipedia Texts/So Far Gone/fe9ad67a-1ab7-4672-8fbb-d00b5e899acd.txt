== Biography ==
The band came together in 2004 through a mutual love of German 'krautrock', early electronica, art rock, noise and psychedelia. Other shared influences all encompassed elements of noise, repetition, sonics and song which became key elements in The Early Years sound. 
The band were initially championed by Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq and Huw Stephens and XFM's John Kennedy, the subsequent radio play that followed brought them to the attention of Beggars Banquet Records and after signing a three-album deal in late 2005, The Early Years released three E.P's and their self-titled debut album, all to widespread critical acclaim.
Following the debut album release in 2006 they embarked on numerous UK tours and performed at festivals including Latitude, Bestival, Truck and Standon Calling. They recorded various live sessions for Radio 1 and XFM, won fans in Brian Eno and Can vocalist Damo Suzuki (who personally invited them to perform as his backing band for a one-off improvised show in Dec 2006) and toured Europe and the States including a string of shows in New York and a number of performances at the South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.
After a self-imposed hiatus put the band on hold in 2008, various formations of the band recorded two further albums, both of which remain incomplete and unreleased. The full band resurfaced in 2011 with a new double A-side single 'Complicity / Fallen Star' on Sonic Cathedral and a sell-out reunion show in London. Marc Riley invited the band in for a live session on his BBC 6Music show and Paul Weller - on hearing the band's latest disc - asked them to remix tracks from his new kraut-infused album 'Sonik Kicks'. Later that year the band were invited to perform at the inaugural Festival Number 6 in Portmerion, North Wales.
In 2014 they performed at the Liverpool International Festival of Psychedelia and the 100 Club in London, releasing a limited edition of 100 cassettes to coincide with the 100 Club show.
To the surprise of many the band finally released their follow-up album – simply titled "II" – in September 2016, ten years after the debut. Self-recorded and self-produced at home in London and Cheshire it was mixed by Jason Kingsland (Deerhunter) and mastered by Frank Arkwright (Mogwai, New Order) at Abbey Road Studios. It was released on Sonic Cathedral Records on Double LP, CD and Digital formats earning widespread critical acclaim, with Shindig Magazine hailing it 'a classic from the first track to the last'. The band were invited back to play at the Liverpool International Festival of Psychedelia and a small UK tour was performed in November 2016.
2017 saw the band make festival appearances at Standon Calling in Hertfordshire, Bluedot at Jodrell Banks and Bristol's Simple Things festival as well as a one off London Show to promote the release of their Remixes EP. They have begun work on their third LP, which has the working title "III".
After helping the band tour album II, Alexander Theakston was asked to join the band as a full time member at the start of 2018.

18 B Sides + DVD

18 B Sides + DVD is a compilation album by American electronica musician Moby. The album's first disc is a CD featuring nine B-sides from his 2002 album 18, as well as four new songs. The second disc is a DVD featuring a live concert at the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival on June 29, 2003, various outtakes and studio demos taken from the Play and 18 studio sessions, a megamix with eleven remixes of six different songs, and music videos for five singles from 18. The DVD also contains an additional non-musical feature entitled Highlights from Moby TV, consisting of several short skits.
The compilation was released in the United States in a CD-style case, and was alternatively released in the United Kingdom in a DVD-style case under the title 18 DVD + B Sides.

Kanbawza Football Club, founded in 2005, played as an amateur club in the Myanmar Premier League, the highest football league in Myanmar at the time.  The club's first manager was Myo Win Nyunt; its first coach was Ye Nyunt. The club won the league championship in 2007 and participated in the AFC President's Cup 2008 tournament. Kanbawza FC was a founding member of the Myanmar National League, which succeeded the Myanmar Premier League in 2009. In the process, the club changed its status from amateur to professional, and changed its home base from Yangon to Taunggyi.
The first professional manager was Aye Maung Gyi, who also served as head coach. The former captain of the Myanmar national team, Soe Myat Min, became Kanbawza's first captain, and the most expensive player in the Myanmar National League. The club has also signed other Myanmar international football team players.
In its first-ever professional football match, Kanbawza won by 3 goals over Okktha United FC. Sa Htet Naing scored the team's first goal and defender Khin Maung Lwin won the Man of the Match award, scoring the team's other two goals.

Prior Pursglove College

Prior Pursglove and Stockton Sixth Form College is a sixth form college with sites in Guisborough and Stockton-on-Tees. The college is a result of a merger between Prior Pursglove College and Stockton Sixth Form College in May 2016. The college is led by a principal and chief executive officer (currently Joanna Bailey) who is accountable to the board of governors.The college educates around 1,600 students on the Guisborough campus, and 700 students on the Stockton campus.


== History ==
In 1561, Robert Pursglove set up a free school on the site which would later come to house Prior Pursglove College. The school existed to enable local boys to learn Latin and also served as an Almshouse for twelve local elderly residents. The school and almshouse was reformed in the 1880s to become Guisborough Grammar School, which lasted until 1971 before becoming Prior Pursglove College. Prior Pursglove merged with South Park Sixth Form College in 1997, eventually consolidating the provision of education on to the Guisborough campus.

=== Buildings ===
The oldest building on site was built by architect Alfred Waterhouse in 1887 for Guisborough Grammar School, and is Grade II listed.  A tablet over the archway reads: "Founded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth AD 1561 Guisborough Grammar School re-erected in the reign of Queen Victoria AD 1887". The Waterhouse Building was refurbished in 2013 and now houses Foundation Learning provision. The Coverdale building is named after the creator of the English translated bible and houses humanity and language education.
Construction of a specialist arts & media building was completed in October 2012. The building was named after Guisborough-born Olympic gold medalist Willie Applegarth and was opened by his descendants and Jade Jones, a then-current Prior Pursglove College student who competed at the London Paralympics in 2012.Other buildings include the Southpark Centre which houses the music, English and drama department and the Priory Centre which houses science, geography, geology, maths, ICT, business studies and psychology. The Prior Centre also contains a Resource Centre where students can spend private study time.
The site is also home to a campus of Askham Bryan College.


=== Educational provision ===
The college mainly specializes in full-time courses for the 16-19 age group, with a wide choice of Advanced level and intermediate courses.
Approximately 1,700 full-time students are enrolled at the college studying a range of courses including AS/A level, BTEC National Diploma and GCSEs.
The college also offers Foundation Learning courses, the Elite Project or Pathways Programme which are designed for 16- to 19-year-olds to help them get back into education, training or employment as well as a number of adult courses.


=== Students' Union ===
The college also has a students' union which is a member of the National Union of Students. The Union is led by a President and Vice President - elected by all students - and who also serve as student members of the  Governing Body. The college has received two awards from the Learning and Skills Improvement Service relating to its student voice provision. In 2011, the college received a Leading the Learner Voice Award in 'Most improved Providerâ€™, for progress in raising the profile of student voice within the college. In 2013 the then-Students' Union President, Darren Melroy, was recognised with a 'Student Governor of the Year' award .

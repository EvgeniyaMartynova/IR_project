Parker's Car Guides

Parkers Car Price Guide is a monthly magazine and, more since 1998, a website with reviews and price lists for new and used cars in the United Kingdom. Initial searches are free, with payment required to access further details.
It was founded in 1972 and is the longest-running price guide available to the public. It expanded over the years to offer reviews, technical data and marketplace intelligence along with pricing. The portfolio of products has been edited by Keith Adams since 2016.
More recently the title has moved the majority of resources to its online activities â€“ and has shifted its emphasis from being merely a valuations resource to a fully featured research tool for car buyers. The Parkers website has expanded to include cars and vans for sale, new and used car reviews, advice articles, finance and news. Typically, the website attracts around three million users per month, according to Comscore, HitWise and GA data. 
Parkers also offers valuations, reviews and news for commercial vehicles (vans and pickups), and the section is headed by CJ Hubbard. Since 2008, Parkers has been owned and published by the German company Bauer Media Group.
The current editorial team consists of:

Editor Keith Adams
Deputy editor Keith WR Jones
Vans and Pickups editor CJ Hubbard
Production manager (print) Percy Lawman
Associate editor Gareth Evans
Consumer editor Sophie Knight
Finance editor Chris Lloyd
New cars editor Adam Binnie
Content manager Lawrence Cheung

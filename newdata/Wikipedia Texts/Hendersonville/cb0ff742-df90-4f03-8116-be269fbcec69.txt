== History ==
John Henderson, a Presbyterian missionary and the town's namesake, settled in the area in 1798.In 1833, the Mississippi Legislature authorized the formation of 17 counties, including Yalobusha.  Yalobusha County's first elected officials, called the "Board of Police", met in 1834 at Hendersonville.  A county seat had not yet been selected, and the Board of Police solicited land donations.  At the second meeting, a nearby location more centrally located in the county, later named Coffeeville, was selected for the county seat.  A local resident, Capt. L. Lake, wrote in 1834: "Hendersonville then went down and ultimately lost its name, being absorbed in a farm known as 'Oakchickamau,'" owned by Franklin E. Plummer.
An early resident of county named Mr. E. Percy Howe, appeared to dislike both Hendersonville and Coffeeville.  He left a poem behind after moving away:

Upon a hill near Derden's MillThere is a place called Coffeeville;The meanest town I ever sawSave Plummer's town, 'Oakchickamau.'

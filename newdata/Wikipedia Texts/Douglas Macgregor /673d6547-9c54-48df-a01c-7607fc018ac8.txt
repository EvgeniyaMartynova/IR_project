Constantines

Constantines is an indie rock band from Guelph, Ontario, Canada.


== History ==
Constantines was formed in Guelph by Steve Lambke, Bryan Webb, Doug MacGregor, and Dallas Wehrle in 1999, following the break-up of Webb and MacGregor's emotional hardcore band Shoulder. Their style has been described as "art-punk", and they have been compared to bands like The Clash, Fugazi, Bruce Springsteen, The Replacements, and Nick Cave.
The name of the band is taken from an episode of Coast to Coast with Art Bell, in which Bell was playing recordings of ghost voices in static, and one of the ghosts' names was Constantine.From their hometown of Guelph the band relocated to London, Ontario and then to Toronto, where in 2001 they released their self-titled first album. Constantines enjoyed widespread play on campus radio and was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Alternative Album. The first track, "Arizona", is based on the suicide of Danny Rapp, the lead singer of Danny and the Juniors of "At the Hop" fame. The song begins with the lyric "This is a song about the death of Danny Rapp. And that great gospel jest called rock 'n' roll." That year they performed at the El Macombo in Toronto with Oneida and Grand Total.In 2002 they added keyboard player Evan Gordon to the lineup and released the EP The Modern Sinner Nervous Man. Gordon left the band soon after to pursue his own song writing. He was replaced by Will Kidman, and the band released Shine a Light in 2003.  This album was the band's first to be released outside of Canada on the Sub Pop record label. It topped the !earshot National Top 50 chart in September that year.In 2004, the label Sub Pop reissued the band's self-titled album. The next year, they embarked on a cross-Canada tour with The Weakerthans called The Rolling Tundra Revue. Later in the year their album Tournament of Hearts was released September 27 by Toronto record label Three Gut Records in Canada, and on October 11 by Sub Pop in the United States.
The members of the Constantines have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze, covering Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended.  The Constantines recorded four Neil Young covers for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.In 2007, following the demise of their Canadian former record label Three Gut Records, the Constantines signed with Arts & Crafts. On January 15, 2008 they released a limited edition 7" on white vinyl, entitled Hard Feelings. Their fourth full-length album, Kensington Heights, was released on April 15 in Canada and April 29 in the US.
Guitarist Steve Lambke has released four albums and a split 12" under the name Baby Eagle, and keyboard player Will Kidman has recorded under the name Woolly Leaves.
In December 2009, the band celebrated their tenth anniversary with a tour of southwestern Ontario.  Shortly thereafter, keyboardist Will Kidman left the band.  This, coupled with Webb's move from his home in Montreal back to Guelph, fueled rumours of the band's demise.  Although Webb hinted that the band might be back,
  Constantines went on an unofficial hiatus for several years.
In 2014 Constantines reformed for a reunion tour, performing at festivals around Canada, including SnappyFest and at Kazoo!Fest in Guelph. In May 2015 the band performed at Massey Hall in Toronto with Chad VanGaalenConstantines were on the line-up for Wayhome summer 2017 music festival in Oro-Medonte, Ontario. and once more performed at Kazoo!Fest.

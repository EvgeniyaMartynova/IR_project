== History ==
In 1996, Waldron and Phillips produced the pilot program for a new series of dramatic radio adaptations of classic stories and novels from around the world.  The series was first presented on National Public Radio Playhouse under the title Generations Radio Theater Presents, and then later as Generations Radio Theater Presents: Radio Tales.  The pilot program was an adaptation of the classic Edgar Allan Poe horror story "Masque of the Red Death", and was described by NPR as "elegantly macabre".  National Public Radio Playhouse aired the pilot program on October 29, 1996.
The Generations Radio Theater Presents: Radio Tales series aired on National Public Radio affiliate stations from 1996 until 2002.  During its broadcast run on National Public Radio, the Radio Tales series was underwritten by the National Endowment for the Arts.  In 2002, the series moved to XM Satellite Radio’s Sonic Theater channel.  Retitled Radio Tales, the series made its XM Satellite Radio premiere on Thanksgiving Day with the holiday program "O. Henry's Thanksgiving".  The Radio Tales series aired on XM Satellite Radio's Sonic Theater channel from 2002 until 2008 and was dropped from the channel when it was renamed Sirus XM Book Radio.

== Critical reception ==
The Radio Tales series has received generally positive reviews for its programs. AudioFile described the series as delivering “vivid, intriguing new radio drama”.  In its review of "The Mummy", Billboard described Phillips’ on-air performance as “a cultured voice that’s appropriate to Stoker’s formal language but is able to convey the appropriate tone of horror,” adding that “subtle and mysterious music adds to the atmosphere”.  In its review of the series’ adaptation of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s feminist horror story "The Yellow Wallpaper", Publishers Weekly wrote, “Sensational. … (Phillips') charged narration is augmented with sound effects and a musical score.”  In reviewing the series’ production "Sleepy Hollow", Billboard wrote, “This telling of Washington Irving’s classic yarn is a real treat”, also describing the music as adding “an effectively spooky touch to the production.”  AudioFile described the series’ production "Masque of the Red Death" as “a magnificent demonstration of the very best the medium has to offer.”  The series was selected as a "Featured Artist Spotlight" by MP3.com, which described the programs as "an art form in and of themselves," adding that the programs feature "richly textured music and sound-scapes commensurate with the changing moods and atmospheres of the text," and that "(Phillips') experience in acting shines through in her apt delivery."

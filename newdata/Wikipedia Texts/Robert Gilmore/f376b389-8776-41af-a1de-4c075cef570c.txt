Pulley (band)

Pulley is a Californian punk rock band formed in 1994. The band is known for straightforward, hard-edged melodic punk rock.


== Band history ==
The band was formed upon vocalist Scott Radinsky's departure from Ten Foot Pole, brought about by that band's desire for a singer with a full-time focus on music (Radinsky was also a major-league relief pitcher and has played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, among others). Pulley's initial lineup included Strung Out drummer Jordan Burns, guitarist Jim Cherry ( former bassist of Strung Out and, later, Zero Down), guitarist Mike Harder, and former Face to Face bassist Matt Riddle. Pulley's debut album, Esteem Driven Engine, was released in 1996 by Epitaph Records. Riddle later joined No Use for a Name full-time and was replaced by Tyler Rebbe. Follow-ups included 60 Cycle Hum (1997), @ !* (1999), Together Again for the First Time (2001), and Matters (2004). On July 30, 2008, Pulley announced a follow up EP to Matters, entitled Time-Insensitive Material which was released on March 24, 2009 on the band's own label, X-Members.
In December 2010, Pulley announced plans to enter the studio in January 2011 to record a new album with producer Matt Hyde. At that time, there was no word on what label would release the album or if it would be self-released by the band like the Time-Insensitive Material EP. On January 2, 2011, the band announced on their Facebook, recording would begin on January 14; however, on January 6, they posted a message on their Facebook saying, "It's our final rehearsal tonight before we go into the studio to record. We got the song structures worked out so now we just have to play them over and over again, they say practice makes perfect." On April 4, 2011, Pulley announced via their Facebook page that they would be releasing a new EP, The Long And The Short Of It, on June 28, 2011.
On September 28, 2016, El Hefe owned record label Cyber Tracks announced that they had signed Pulley, and released their first studio album in 12 years, No Change in the Weather, on November 18. The release of this album marked the band's 20th anniversary.

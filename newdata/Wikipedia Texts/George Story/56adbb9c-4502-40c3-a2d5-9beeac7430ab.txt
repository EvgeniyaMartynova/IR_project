George Story (journalist)

George Story was an American journalist. As a baby being cradled by a doctor, he was featured on a photo-insert in the inaugural issue of Life, dated November 23, 1936. Captioned under the photograph were the words "Life Begins". Story grew up to become a journalist and later on, a city manager. A married man, he spent his retirement years in Hawaii. Story died of a cardiac arrest on April 4, 2000, just a month after Time Inc. announced it would cease regular publication of LIFE with the May issue. Fittingly, the last issue of LIFE was titled "A Life Ends", featuring his story and how it had intertwined with the magazine over the years.

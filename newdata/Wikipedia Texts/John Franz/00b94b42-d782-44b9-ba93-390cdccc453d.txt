John Baptist Franz (October 29, 1896 – July 3, 1992) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Dodge City (1951–59) and Bishop of Peoria (1959–71).


== Early life and education ==
John Franz was born in Springfield, Illinois, to Fridolin and Louisa (née Reisch) Franz. His father worked in the meat packing business. He recalled that his parents "provided us an atmosphere that made us conscious we were Catholic and that we belonged to the Church. I never wanted to be anything but a priest." He received his early education at the parochial school of SS. Peter and Paul Church in his native city. Between 1910 and 1917, he attended St. Francis Solanus High School and the Franciscan College in Quincy. He then studied at Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri.


== Priesthood ==
Franz was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Alton by Archbishop John J. Glennon on June 13, 1920. From 1920 to 1927, as a member of the Granite City-based Diocesan Mission Band, he traveled around Central Illinois and Eastern Missouri to give missions and retreats. In 1926, he was assigned to establish a campaign fund for a cathedral complex in Springfield.Franz became administrator of St. Mary's Church and superintendent of St. Isidore High School, both in Farmersville, in 1927. From 1935 to 1951, he served as rector of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. He was named a papal chamberlain in December 1941, and raised to the rank of domestic prelate in April 1945.


== Episcopacy ==


=== Dodge City ===
On May 27, 1951, Franz was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Dodge City in Kansas by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 29 from Samuel Cardinal Stritch, with Bishops Mark Carroll and William O'Connor serving as co-consecrators.


=== Peoria ===
Franz later returned to Illinois upon being named the fifth Bishop of Peoria on August 8, 1959. From 1962 to 1965, he attended the Second Vatican Council in Rome. In response to his implementation of the Council's reforms, some people expressed enthusiasm, while others caution to such rapid changes. The political turmoil of the 1960s also added to his challenges, but he still managed to create 17 new grade schools, two new high schools, one Newman Centre, four new parishes, four missions, and elevate eight missions to parish status. After 11 years of service, he resigned as Bishop on May 24, 1971.Franz died at age 95., and is buried at St. Mary's Cemetery in Peoria.

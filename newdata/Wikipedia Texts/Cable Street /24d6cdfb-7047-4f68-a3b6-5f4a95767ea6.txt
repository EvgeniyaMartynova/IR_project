Knebworth

Knebworth is a village and civil parish in the north of Hertfordshire, England, immediately south of Stevenage. The civil parish covers an area between the villages of Datchworth, Woolmer Green, Codicote, Kimpton, Whitwell, St Paul's Walden and Langley, and encompasses the village of Knebworth, the small village of Old Knebworth and Knebworth House.


== History ==
There is evidence of people living in the area as far back as Neolithic times and it is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it is referred to as Chenepeworde (the farm belonging to the Dane, Cnebba) with a population of 150. The original village, now known as Old Knebworth, developed around Knebworth House. Development of the newer Knebworth village started in the late 19th century centred a mile to the east of Old Knebworth on the new railway station and the Great North Road (subsequently the A1, and now the B197 since the opening of the A1(M) motorway in 1962).
At the turn of the century the architect Edwin Lutyens built Homewood, southeast of Old Knebworth, as a dower house for Edith Bulwer-Lytton. Her daughter, the suffragette Constance Lytton also lived there, until just before her death in 1923.Knebworth has, since 1974, been famously associated with numerous major open air rock and pop concerts at Knebworth House, including Queen's final live performance which took place on 9 August 1986 and drew an attendance estimated at 125,000, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Oasis playing to a quarter of a million people for 2 nights in 1996 and more recently Robbie Williams, who for three nights in August 2003 performed to the largest crowds ever assembled for a single performer.

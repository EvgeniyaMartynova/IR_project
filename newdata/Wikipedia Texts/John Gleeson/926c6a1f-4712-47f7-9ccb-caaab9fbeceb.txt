== Tenure as district judge ==
As a district judge Gleeson was a critic of harsh mandatory sentencing, going so far as to request federal prosecutors vacate convictions he had been forced to impose. Judge Gleeson's ruling against the FBI in a landmark racial profiling case was reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009). Judge Gleeson oversaw the prosecution of Jordan Belfort, famous as the "Wolf of Wall Street". In 2012 Judge Gleeson approved a deferred prosecution agreement with HSBC widely criticized as being too lenient. He caused controversy in 2016 by ordering reports by the bank's independent monitor publicly disclosed. In his last days on the bench Judge Gleeson, instead of issuing a writ of audita querela, invented a new "federal certificate of rehabilitation" to help convicts find jobs.

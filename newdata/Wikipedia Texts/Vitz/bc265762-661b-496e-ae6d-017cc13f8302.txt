Toyota Vitz

The Toyota Vitz (Japanese:トヨタ・ヴィッツ, Toyota Vuittsu) is a line of three- and five-door hatchback subcompact cars that was produced from 1999 until 2019 by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota. Throughout its production, the name "Vitz" nameplate had been used consistently in Japan, with most international markets received the same vehicle under the Toyota Yaris name, or formerly as the Toyota Echo in some markets for the first generation. The Vitz was available in Japan from Toyota's Netz Store dealerships.
As of 2010, the first two generations had achieved in excess of 3.5 million sales in over 70 countries, including more than 1.4 million in Japan.The "Vitz" nameplate was discontinued in Japan in 2019 for the fourth generation Yaris. The nameplate change is due to sharp drop in sales.


== First generation (XP10; 1999–2005) ==

The first generation XP10 series Vitz was designed by Sotiris Kovos at Toyota's ED2 studio in Europe. It was first unveiled at the 1998 Paris Motor Show. Production began in late 1998, with a Japanese on-sale date of January 1999; European sales commenced two months later as the "Toyota Yaris". When introduced to Australasia in October 1999, the "Toyota Echo" name was used, as was the case in Canada when released there in 2003 for the 2004 model year. The "Echo" and "Yaris" names were also given to the export version of the related Japanese market Toyota Platz sedan, also available as a coupé in North America. Often sold alongside the hatchback and marketed as a single line of vehicles, exterior panels common between the Vitz and Platz were restricted to the front doors. However, as Vitz and Platz were designed using the same platform, the mechanicals are largely identical and both share a common dashboard module. There was also a "Yaris Verso" or "Echo Verso" variant sold in some export markets from late 1999, based on the Japanese "Toyota Fun Cargo". The Verso MPV utilizes the same running gear as the Vitz, but features a more spacious interior.
At its introduction in 1999, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award.
What became the XP10 series was shown earlier in concept form at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show. This concept, titled "Funtime" was developed under the leadership of Shuhei Toyoda, who also commissioned two additional models based on the same platform: the "Funcoupe" and the "Funcargo", the predecessor to the forthcoming production model Fun Cargo. Styled in Brussels by Toyota's European Office of Creation (EPOC), the "Fun project" as it was known, was envisaged to underline the versatility of shared platform engineering. These concept vehicles morphed into the New Basic Car (NBC) program, with each separate NBC model designated a number, NBC1 in the case of the Vitz three-door. The name Vitz is the phonetic Anglicized spelling of the German word Witz which means "wit" (however, its principal meaning in contemporary German is "joke"). Toyota claims the contrived name Yaris is "intended to convey a European impression", while Echo "is intended to Echo nothing."Instead of conventional analogue instruments, the Vitz utilized digital instruments which were mounted in a "pod" in the center of the dashboard. When sales commenced in the Canadian market this was not the case, with Toyota opting to fit a conventional speedometer, still mounted in the center of the dashboard.
In 2003, the facelifted 'Phase 2' Vitz was released with different bumpers and 'teardrop' front lights.


=== Safety ===
Euro NCAP crash tested the dual-airbag equipped XP10 series in 2000, rating the car 29 out of 37 for adult occupant protection, or four out of five stars. The pedestrian rating (pre-2002) is 13 points or two of out of four stars. In July 2004, ANCAP tested the XP10 with only a driver's airbag fitted, resulting in a 23.64 out of 37 grading, or three out of five stars. The 2010 edition of Monash University's Used Car Safety Ratings (UCSR), found that the XP10 provides a "poor" (two out of five stars) level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.


=== Markets ===


==== Asia ====
The Japanese launch of the Vitz occurred on 13 January 1999, and along with the related Platz, was retailed through the Netz dealership channel.The Vitz "RS" was introduced in October 2000. The "RS" featured revised front and rear bumpers, a mesh grille, black-tinted headlamps, front fog lamps, side skirts and alloy wheels. Interior upgrades include, sports-oriented front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a leather and chrome gear shifter, and metallic door sill scuff plates. Two engines were available in the "RS", the 1.3-litre 84 hp (63 kW) 2NZ-FE and the 1.5-litre 110 hp (82 kW) 1NZ-FE. More powerful brakes and a firmer suspension calibration were also fitted to the "RS".
The Phase 2 Vitz RS was modified by Toyota Racing Development (TRD) mainly for the domestic Japanese market, and outfitted with an IHI Rhf4 turbocharger with 0.5 bars (7.3 psi) boost. Produced in limited numbers, the TRD-tuned "RS" sported the 1.5-litre engine, and produced 148 hp (110 kW) and offered a 0–100 kilometres per hour (0–62 mph) time of 7.9 seconds.
The Yaris was also sold in China as the Xiali Vizi from December 2002 to 2012, equipped with a 1.0 and 1.3 litre engine.


==== Australia ====

The XP10 series was introduced to Australia on 8 October 1999 as the "Echo", replacing the Starlet. Both the three- and five-door hatchback variants were available, which sold alongside the four-door Toyota Platz-derived Echo sedan. Sourced from Japan, Australian-market Echo hatchbacks received the 1.3-litre 2NZ-FE engine with a standard five-speed manual transmission and optional four-speed automatic. The base model was fitted with a driver's airbag and cassette player, although the optional safety pack added a passenger airbag and anti-lock brakes (ABS). Power steering was made standard equipment in October 2002. The Echo "Sportivo" was introduced in March 2001, fitted with the 1.5-litre 1NZ-FE engine with manual transmission only. Compared to the models equivalent to the Echo "Sportivo" in other markets (the Vitz "RS" in Japan, and Yaris "T-Sport" in Europe), the Australian variant is distinguishable with its locally developed T-CAM (Toyota Conversions, Accessories and Motorsport) body kit and downgraded 14-inch alloy wheels.Sales of the facelifted hatchback range commenced in March 2003. At the same time, the price dropped and standard equipment was increased, with air conditioning, a CD player, and remote keyless entry included, although the safety pack was deleted as an option all together. Consequently, ANCAP tested the Echo in July 2004 and demoted it from a four- to a three-star safety rating. ANCAP had previously based its four-star rating on the test conducted by Euro NCAP, which was performed with the passenger airbag fitted. Following the reassessment, Toyota reintroduced the safety pack from 1 December 2004 for the 2005 model year. In June 2005, Toyota Australia launched the Echo "Rush" three- and five-doors. Additional equipment fitted over the base model included 14-inch alloy wheels, front power windows, and front fog lamps.


==== Europe ====
The Vitz, marketed as the "Yaris" in Europe, was initially available with gasoline-powered inline-four engines in displacements of 1.0 and 1.3-litres, both featuring Toyota's VVT-i technology. The use of sophisticated engine management systems was said to give the equivalent of 1.4-litre performance from the 70 hp (52 kW) 1.0-litre engine, while maintaining low fuel consumption and emissions. In 2001, the range was expanded via the addition of the warm hatch "T Sport" (equivalent to the Vitz "RS" in Japan), fitted with the 1.5-litre engine. After March 2002, a 1.4-litre D4-D diesel engine offering 75 hp (56 kW) was also included in the lineup.
In most European markets, the Yaris was a stronger seller than the Starlet that it replaced. The XP10 was voted European Car of the Year in 2000, and also the 2000 Semperit Irish Car of the Year.
European-market Yaris was also exported to Israel as well as in Morocco.


==== North America ====
The Vitz was not sold in North America until 2003 when it launched in Canada under the "Echo" name for the 2004 model year. Prior to this, only the Platz-based Echo sedan and coupé were available in Canada. The hatchback (three and five door) was introduced in Canada only due to the higher sales achieved by the sedan and coupé compared to the United States. Minor changes were made to meet Canadian safety requirements such as larger bumpers. The Echo hatchback was offered in four different trims in Canada, the LE being the standard version available in three or five door variants. The CE was an economy version only available with three doors and did not feature power steering, a rear wiper or a four-way speaker system, while the RS was only available with five doors and featured an aero package, aluminium alloy wheels, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob along with sport seats.Although an RS version was offered, it is not sportier than the other Canadian variations as it consisted of cosmetic changes only. All Canadian-bound Echo hatches were sold with the 1.5-litre 1NZ-FE engine and rated at 108 hp (81 kW).
In 2004, for the 2005 model year, a tachometer was added.

=== Yaris Cabrio Concept (2000) ===
Toyota Yaris Cabrio concept car was presented at the March 2000 Geneva Motor Show. The Yaris Cabrio featured a fabric roof. It never reached the production stage. Another similar concept based on the XP150 Yaris was showcased at the 23rd Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in August 2015, being called Yaris Legian.


== Second generation (XP90; 2005–2011) ==

Toyota redesigned the Vitz in early 2005, going on sale in Japan that February. The Toyota Belta sedan shares underpinnings with the Vitz. However, while the Vitz was designed at Toyota's European ED2 design studios, the Belta was designed at their Japanese design studios. While the outgoing Vitz hatchback and Platz sedan look and feel virtually alike, the redesigned Vitz and Belta are more subtly related. The two cars share a frame and the drivetrain components however the sheet metal is different.

The European, Australian, Canadian, Mexican, Venezuelan and Puerto Rican markets saw the second generation Vitz near the end of 2005. In the Australian and North American markets, the car was sold as the "Yaris" for the first time. The production Yaris for the US market was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006. The XP90 series Yaris is built in Japan, France, and Thailand.
The previous 4-cylinder 1.0 VVT-i engine was replaced by the 3-cylinder engine also found in the Toyota Aygo. The 1.3-litre engine was revised to offer slightly more power, and the 1.4 D-4D got a 15 PS (11 kW; 15 hp) boost to 90 PS (66 kW; 89 hp), the former engine allowing it to achieve exceptional fuel economy. For the European market in early 2009 the Yaris added a 1.33-litre engine with Stop & Start technology. The Yaris became the first car in its class to offer nine airbags.It also received a minor facelift in 2010 with slight subtle revisions to its bumper with in-built cornering protectors, air dams and an orange tinted signal on its tail lamps.
From 2011 to 2013, Daihatsu sold the XP90 Yaris under the "Daihatsu Charade" name as a Thai-produced five-door hatchback. Powertrains comprised a 1.3-litre engine and six-speed manual or optional automatic. The Charade was sold alongside the XP130 Yaris.The XP90 continued to be built in China and Thailand until it was replaced by the XP150 in November 2013.


=== Vitz RS ===

The Vitz RS was launched in 2007. It was first seen at the Geneva Motor Show and is powered 1.5 L 4-cylinder VVT-i engine rated 107 bhp (80 kW) and 140 N⋅m (103 lbf⋅ft). The RS features 16 inch alloy wheels, a RS badged mesh grille, a redesigned front and rear bumper, redesigned taillamps, deep side skirts and a tail spoiler. It also features sports tuned steering and suspension as well as disc rear brakes.
The Vitz RS is sold in North American and Europe markets as the Yaris TS. As with the previous T-Sport, there are extra rear reflectors on the bumper. Essentially, it is a Japanese market Vitz RS fitted with a 1.8-litre 2ZR-FE engine rated 130 hp (97 kW) and 173 N⋅m (128 lb⋅ft), which can reach 100 km/h (62 mph) in under 10 seconds.For model year 2007 on Japanese models only, G-BOOK, a subscription telematics service, is offered as an option.
The facelifted Vitz RS/Yaris TS was also a basis for the 2012 Yaris facelift for Indonesian, Philippine and Thai markets.

=== Recall ===
In January 2009, Toyota recalled 1.28 million vehicles worldwide based on the Yaris platform, such as the Vitz, Belta and the Ractis. The recall is based on a seat belt defect that, in severe front-end collisions, could cause a foam pad in the vehicle to ignite.

==== North America ====
The second generation US Yaris is the successor to the previous North American Toyota Echo. In the US, the 3-door Vitz shares the Yaris name with the Toyota Belta sedan. The 3-door model is called the 'Yaris Liftback', while the 5-door model will be sold starting with the 2009 model year and competes with the similarly equipped Scion xD. The 2008 model year US Yaris comes standard with the 1.5-litre VVT-i engine producing 106 hp (79 kW) and 103 lb⋅ft (140 N⋅m) and five-speed manual transmission C54, the four-speed automatic U340E being optional. Fuel economy is rated at 29 mpg‑US (8.1 L/100 km; 35 mpg‑imp) in the city and 36 mpg‑US (6.5 L/100 km; 43 mpg‑imp) on the highway with the manual transmission. While front airbags are standard, as mandated by the law, ABS and side airbags are available only as an option. In some southern states, a special Yaris Onyx was released in January 2009 that added 17-inch wheels and a number of cosmetic items.The Canadian Yaris hatchback is available in 3 and 5-door models and is similar to the US variant, running on the Toyota NZ engine, a 1.5 L 4-cylinder VVT-i engine rated 106 bhp (79 kW) and 103 lb⋅ft (140 N⋅m). The 2006 Yaris with the 1.5-litre engine can achieve fuel economy ratings of 40 miles per US gallon (5.9 L/100 km; 48 mpg‑imp) during highway driving and 34 mpg‑US (6.9 L/100 km; 41 mpg‑imp) during city driving. 3-door CE and 5-door LE versions come with 14-inch wheels, while RS models are equipped with 15-inch alloys with standard anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD).

For the 2009 year, the Yaris 5-door liftbacks join the lineup of the existing 4-door sedans and 3-door liftbacks because of the increased demand for fuel efficient subcompact cars. In addition to the new 5-door liftback, all 2009 Yaris models come standard with anti-lock brakes (ABS), front seat-mounted side airbags and front and rear curtain side airbags. For 2009, Toyota also added cruise control as an option on liftback models, and has added a few more colour choices.The Yaris has been praised by the automotive press for its extremely high fuel economy, but criticized for its excessive body roll (due to a soft suspension and high ride height) and the initial lack of a manual transmission on 5-door models.
The 2010 model has a 5-speed manual option for the 5-door. It also has the Star Safety System – Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) + Traction Control (TRAC), Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist.

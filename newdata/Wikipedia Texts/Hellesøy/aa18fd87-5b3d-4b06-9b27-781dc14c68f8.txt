Hellisøy Lighthouse

Hellisøy Lighthouse (Norwegian: Hellisøy fyr) is a coastal lighthouse in Fedje municipality in Hordaland county, Norway.  The lighthouse lies on the small island of Hellisøy, just off the southwest coast of the larger island of Fedje.  


== History ==
This tower was built in 1855, making it Norway's second-oldest cast iron lighthouse.  It is essentially a copy of the Eigerøy Lighthouse built a year earlier on the southwest coast.  The lighthouse was automated in 1992.
The lighthouse emits a continuous white light with a more intense flash every 30 seconds.  The light sits at an elevation of about 46 metres (151 ft) above sea level.  The 32-metre (105 ft) tall round cast iron tower is painted red with two narrow white horizontal bands. There is a 3rd order Fresnel lens in the lighthouse that has been in use since 1903.  The lens puts out a light with an intensity of 960,000 candela which can be seen for up to 18.8 nautical miles (34.8 km; 21.6 mi).

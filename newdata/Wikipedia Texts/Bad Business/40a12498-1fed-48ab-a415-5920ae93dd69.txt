Spenser (film series)

Joe Mantegna portrayed Robert B. Parker's  detective "Spenser" in three TV films on the A&E cable network between 1999 and 2001.


== Production ==
Robert B. Parker had a significant role in the development of the TV movies (all three films were adapted by Parker, with his wife co-authoring Walking Shadow) as opposed to the earlier Spenser: For Hire. Nonetheless, he felt that the movies didn't get it right, not because of the performances but because of the limited budget. Parker had a small role in the first film, and cameos in the later two. His son, Daniel, and wife, Joan, appear in Thin Air.
All three movies were filmed in Canada.

== Critical reception ==
Chul Gugich of Beats Per Minute gave the album a 73 out of 100, saying, "Grayskul has done its part in keeping Seattle hip hop weird and unpredictable." Kyle Fleck of The Stranger described it as "a sprawling collection of 17 tracks that broadens Grayskul's core aesthetic while maintaining their trademark dark humor and densely packed wordplay, with a diverse set of beats of a quality befitting the upper echelon of the underground." Azaria C. Podplesky of Seattle Weekly said, "a variety of lyrical content and futuristic beats keep things interesting."

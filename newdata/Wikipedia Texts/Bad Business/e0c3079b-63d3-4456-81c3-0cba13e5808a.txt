Star Wars Tales

Star Wars Tales is a comic book series published by Dark Horse Comics, beginning on September 29, 1999, and completing its run on July 13, 2005. Each issue featured several unrelated stories from various eras of the Star Wars timeline. All stories from Issue #20 and before have been retroactively labelled "Infinities", placing them outside the Star Wars canon. Starting with Issue #21, when Tales changed editors, all stories are considered to be within continuity, unless labelled otherwise. Tales stories from before Issue #21 are still considered non-canon, although canon references to the stories can and have been made, which incorporates those elements referenced into official continuity.
On average, each story spans ten to twelve pages, with approximately six stories in each issue, adding up to a total of sixty-four pages. A sixteen-page "Free Comic Book Day Edition" was released in May 2002. There are also six Tales trade paperbacks, collecting four full issues each.

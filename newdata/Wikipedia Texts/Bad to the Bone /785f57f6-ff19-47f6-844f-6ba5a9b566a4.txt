Bad to the Bone (Running Wild song)

Death or Glory is the fifth studio album by German heavy metal band Running Wild, released 8 November 1989 through Noise Records. It is their last album with both guitarist Majk Moti and drummer Ian Finlay. Being one of their most successful releases, it contains the concert favourites "Riding the Storm" and "Bad to the Bone". The final track, "March On", was not included on the vinyl release due to space constraints.
The CD version (both the original and remastered) of the album contains 1991's Wild Animal EP, albeit with a different running order than that of the original. However, despite the presence of Wild Animal on the original pressing CD, neither the booklet nor back insert tray mention these songs. But the CD non-playing side (of the original pressing), however, does list the 4 songs from this EP. The booklet on the remastered version has the full info on including of the EP.
Running Wild filmed a live video to the song "Bad to the Bone", recorded in Düsseldorf. The song had some airtime at MTVs Headbangers Ball. "Riding the Storm" also had a live video that was also shot in Düsseldorf with a crowd of nearly 9,000 attendees.
The track "Bad to the Bone" was recorded by a cappella band van Canto and was released on their fourth studio album Break the Silence.

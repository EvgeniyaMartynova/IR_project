== History ==
A law of June 26, 1914, created a canton by the name of "De Osa". This new entity encompassed much of the national territory of southernmost Costa Rica. The town of Buenos Aires became the new canton's capital. A law approved on July 29, 1940, split off a coastal portion of the canton and gave it the original name of the region, "Osa". The remaining area of the original canton was renamed "Buenos Aires", assuming the name of its capital city.

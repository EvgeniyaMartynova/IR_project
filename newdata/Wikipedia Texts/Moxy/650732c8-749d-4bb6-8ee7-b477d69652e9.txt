5-MeO-MiPT

5-MeO-MiPT is a psychedelic and hallucinogenic drug, used by some as an entheogen.  It has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to the drugs 5-MeO-DiPT, DiPT, and MiPT. It is commonly used as a "substitute" for 5-MeO-DiPT because of the very similar structure and effects.


== Chemistry ==
5-MeO-MiPT is in a class of compounds commonly known as tryptamines, and is the N-methyl-N-isopropyl homologue of the psychedelic, 5-MeO-DMT.  The full name of the chemical is 5-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine.
5-MeO-MiPT causes the ehrlich reagent to turn purple then fade to faint blue. It causes the marquis reagent to go yellow through to black.


== Effects ==
This is an analogue of the more popular drug 5-MeO-DiPT (nicknamed "foxy methoxy") and has the nickname "moxy". Some users report the tactile effects of 5-MeO-DiPT without some of the unwanted side effects.  At higher doses it becomes much more psychedelic sometimes being compared to 5-MeO-DMT. But at doses of 4-10 milligrams users find 5-MeO-MiPT to be a very euphoric and tactile chemical. Its energetic effects can be very strong at high doses, increasing normal heart rate considerably. Sounds can be amplified in perception to a point where synesthetic effects ("touching or/and tasting sounds") occur.


== Pharmacodynamics ==


== Dosage ==
Orally, 5-MeO-MiPT is active at 4-6 mg.  The drug can also be smoked, but unlike most other tryptamines, this route requires a much higher dosage.  10–20 mg is usually smoked.  It typically produces a very strong odor.
Some users report activity as low as 1 mg while others report no activity up to 20 mg, this compound seems to be highly sensitive to the individual and any potential researchers should keep this in mind. Titrating the dose would be especially important with this compound.
Some users report little to no visual activity until doses of 10 mg or higher are taken. This chemical proves very useful for opening up and expressing oneself much like MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and may be a useful chemical in psychedelic therapy.


== Pharmacology ==
The mechanism that produces the hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects of 5-MeO-MiPT is thought to result primarily from 5-HT2A receptor agonism, although additional mechanisms of action such as inhibition of MAO may be involved also. 5-MeO-MiPT binds most strongly to 5-HT1A receptors; it also shows fairly strong binding affinity to the SERT and NET, thereby acting as a moderately potent serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. These mechanisms may help explain why there are many anecdotal reports of anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects from modest doses of this compound. For example, SNRIs such as venlafaxine are commonly prescribed to treat depression, and the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone is prescribed primarily for treatment of anxiety.


== Dangers ==
The toxicity of 5-MeO-MiPT is not known but as with all research chemicals doses should be carefully weighed on an accurate milligram scale and users should take caution because overdoses are not listed. There are many reports of vasoconstriction with it as well. There is no known documentation of death attributed to the use of 5-MeO-MiPT alone.


== Legal status ==


=== China ===
As of October 2015 5-MeO-MiPT is a controlled substance in China.


=== United Kingdom ===
5-MeO-MiPT is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as are most ethers of ring-hydroxy tryptamines.


=== United States ===
5-MeO-MiPT is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it could be considered an analog of 5-MeO-DiPT, in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act.

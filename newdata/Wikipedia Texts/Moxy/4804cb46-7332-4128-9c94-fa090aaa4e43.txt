Moxy (airline)

Moxy is a proposed airline in the United States founded by David Neeleman—who previously co-founded Morris Air, WestJet, JetBlue, and Azul Linhas Aereas—with an initial startup capital of $100 million. On July 17, 2018, Moxy signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus for 60 A220-300 to be delivered from 2021. In early October 2019, it was reported that the airline could launch flights as early as 2020 using secondhand aircraft, acquired from Azul.


== History ==
In June 2018, David Neeleman planned a new United States airline named Moxy as he registered a new entity with $100 million in capital from former Air Canada CEO Robert Milton, former ILFC CEO Henri Courpron and himself. Due to consolidation, all 11 major carriers are profitable and existed 20 years ago except JetBlue, which Neeleman started in 2000, leaving space for a new competitor. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines carried 80% of domestic US seats in 2017 and Alaska Airlines, Allegiant, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Hawaiian Airlines, Spirit Airlines and Virgin America most of the rest.Due to loss of service to smaller markets, U.S. domestic air capacity remained stagnant from 2007 to 2017 while the economy expanded by 34%.
To fill this gap, Moxy plans to offer point-to-point flights from smaller secondary airports like Providence International Airport, Fort Worth or Burbank Airport, bypassing hubs for shorter travel times. The airline is also reportedly considering longer distance flights to South America and Europe.
It would offer spacious seats and free Wi-Fi, and extra fees for snacks or seating assignment more like Azul and JetBlue than ultra low-cost carriers like Allegiant Air or Spirit Airlines.
To begin flying operations, 60 A220-300s (previously known as the Bombardier CS300) were ordered, soliciting Chinese lessors to finance 18 to be delivered from 2021 onward. However, in order to accelerate the airline's launch, Moxy may utilize used Azul Embraer E195 and leased Airbus A320 aircraft as soon as 2020.Moxy is a project name, colliding with Marriott's Moxy Hotels. A possible permanent name for the airline is Breeze, the current name of the holding company that owns the airline.

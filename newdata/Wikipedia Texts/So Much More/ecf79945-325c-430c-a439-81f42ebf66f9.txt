Al Shipley of Stylus Magazine praised the song's production by Cool & Dre, describing the backing track as "bumping". RapReviews.com writer Steve Juon called "So Much More" "one of the hardest so-called crossover songs to hit the top of the charts in a long time", noting that the song's quality meant that "[All or Nothing] had some pretty high expectations riding in because of the two lead singles" ("So Much More" and the following single "Get It Poppin'", a collaboration with rapper Nelly). Juon praised the song's lyrics as "hardcore, and fuckin' funny as hell to boot", and also commended Joe's decision to sing the chorus, noting that although this was surprising, Joe is "a lot better at it [singing] than I am".

So Much More (Judith Durham album)

So Much More is a compilation album of previously unreleased tracks by Australian recording artist Judith Durham. The album was released in June 2018.
Upon release, Durham confirmed she will not tour, saying: "I won't be on the stage. No, I'm telling everyone I'm singing for them virtually now. I don't think I'll be touring again."


== Background and release ==
So Much More is a collection of 14 previously unreleased tracks, some of whose origins date back decades and were all written (or co-written) by Durham. Durham told The Australian: "I was always doing other projects, and never quite got back to this material. The Seekers toured, Judith toured, broken hips — God knows what. It's amazing I'm still alive. There's always too much to do. I just can't keep track because it's a very creative life."The title track "So Much More" was a previously unreleased 1967 recording. The album includes tracks co-written by fellow Seeker Keith Potger, Adam Thompson of Chocolate Starfish and Mark Holden (who was an executive producer of the album, along with Graham Simpson and Mahlia Simpson). The album was released to celebrate Durham's 75th birthday on 3 July.

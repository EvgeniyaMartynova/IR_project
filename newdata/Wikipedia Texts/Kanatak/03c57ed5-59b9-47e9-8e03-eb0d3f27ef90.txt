== History ==
The area that is today Kanata Lakes was originally part of the Township of March, and was first settled by Europeans in the early 19th century. One site dating from this era is Pinhey's Point. It remained mainly agricultural until the 1960s when it became the site of heavy development. Modern Kanata is largely the creation of William Teron, a developer who purchased 4,000 acres (16 km2) of rural land and set about building a model community: "A Garden City". The lands around the Kanata Lakes Golf & Country Club formed the initial core of Kanata Lakes when it was developed years later.
Currently KNL Developments, a consortium, consisting of Urbandale and Richcraft, as well as Uniform and Cardel, are clear-cutting 2 km2 (0.77 sq mi) of the Beaver Pond Forest to facilitate further development of Kanata Lakes.

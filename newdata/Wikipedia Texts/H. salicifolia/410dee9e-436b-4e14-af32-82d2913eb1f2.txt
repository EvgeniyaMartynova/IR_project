Heteropsis salicifolia (page does not exist)

This is a list of genera in the plant family Araceae.  As currently circumscribed, the family contains over 3700 species into approximately a hundred genera. The family's taxonomy remains in flux, and a full taxonomic treatment integrating the mass of phylogenetic data that has become available in the last 10 years remain to be produced. The classification presented here is informed by the review of Mayo et al. (2013).

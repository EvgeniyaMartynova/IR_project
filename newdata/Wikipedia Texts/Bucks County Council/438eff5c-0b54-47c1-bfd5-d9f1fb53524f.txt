Buckinghamshire County Council

Buckinghamshire County Council is the upper-tier local authority for the non-metropolitan county of Buckinghamshire, in England, the United Kingdom established in 1889 following the Local Government Act 1888. The county council's offices are in Aylesbury.
The borders of the ceremonial county and county council have changed several times and no longer align, with the last reorganisation in 1997 when the Borough of Milton Keynes became a unitary authority.
The council consists of 49 councillors, and is controlled by the Conservative Party, which has 41 councillors. It has been controlled by the Conservatives since the reorganisation of local government in 1973. For the 2013 elections, the number of seats was reduced from 57 to 49 following the 2012 changes in division boundaries.In March 2018 Sajid Javid, the Communities Secretary at the time, backed proposals to replace the county council and the four district councils (Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, South Bucks, and Wycombe) with a single unitary authority, named Buckinghamshire Council. As of January 2019, Chiltern, South Bucks and Wycombe district councils had launched legal action against the "undemocratic" plans for how the unitary authority was to be set-up.


== Composition ==

Elections are held every four years, interspersed by three years of elections to the four district councils in the county.

Conservative councillors represent most of the county, both in terms of number of seats and geographic area. Four seats in Aylesbury are held by the Liberal Democrats, and the sole Labour member was elected in Booker, Cressex & Castlefield, in the suburbs of High Wycombe. Independents hold the divisions of Ryemead & Micklefield, Totteridge & Bowerdean, and West Wycombe, also in the High Wycombe area.


== History ==

County architect Fred Pooley designed the Council's 12-storey tower block at Aylesbury built in 1966 which became known as "Fred's Fort" and less flatteringly as "Pooley's Folly".

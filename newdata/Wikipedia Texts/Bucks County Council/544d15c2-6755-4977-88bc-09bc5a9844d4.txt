Bucks County Council (Boy Scouts of America)

The program of the Boy Scouts of America is administered through 272 local councils, with each council covering a geographic area that may vary from a single city to an entire state. Each council receives an annual charter from the National Council and is usually incorporated as a charitable organization. Most councils are administratively divided into districts that directly serve Scout units.
Councils fall into one of four regions: Western, Central, Southern, and Northeast. Each region is then subdivided into areas. The total number of councils depends on how they are counted:

There are 272 individual local councils
Direct Service covers units outside of local councilsâ€” although technically not a council it is assigned a council number
Greater New York Councils has five boroughs, each with an assigned council number
Michigan Crossroads Council has four field service councils, each with an assigned council number
Each of the four regions has an assigned council number

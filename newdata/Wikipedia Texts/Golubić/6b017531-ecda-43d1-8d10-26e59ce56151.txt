== History ==
Gold jewellery dating to the beginning of the 7th century have been found, as well as an early Croatian graveyard and the fragments of church furniture dating to the 9th or 10th century, near the St. Stephen Orthodox church.The Orthodox Church of St. Stephen was built in 1462. In 1692, it served as the seat of the Dalmatian bishop Vasilije I. In 1774, Serbian philosopher Dositej Obradović was a teacher in the village.

During the Croatian War of Independence, the village was held by Serb troops, which established military camp led by Dragan Vasiljković, suspected for maltreatments of Croatian captives in Knin camp. After the fall of Serbian Krajina, most Serbs left the village, and Bosnian Croats settled here.
A monument was built outside the church commemorating 34 Serb residents who were killed in the war, most during the Operation Storm. On October 2, 2011, the Croatian government issued a ban on a commemoration gathering, ordering the church to remove the monument as "two thirds of the place that the monument was built on belong to the state and that only one third belongs to the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC)." and "the ban has removed danger of bigger incidents and unrest".

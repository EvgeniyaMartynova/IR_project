George Somers Leigh Clarke

George Somers Clarke (1822–1882) was an English architect.  He became a RIBA Associate in March 1845 and a Fellow in June 1859. He sat on RIBA Council.  In 1868 he had offices at 20 Cockspur Street, London. He was a pupil of Sir Charles Barry and worked for him on designs for the Palace of Westminster in 1849.
Through working with Barry, he became sufficiently well respected to be invited to submit designs for buildings such as the Foreign Office, Law Courts and National Gallery, London. His competition design for the Midland Grand Hotel, St Pancras, London, whilst not the winning scheme, was considered highly enough to receive a premium from the judges. His buildings were regularly illustrated in the architectural press in the 1860s. He was the uncle of Somers Clarke (1841–1926) who was also an architect.
He travelled extensively in Europe.  He married Louisa Harker Williamson in Croydon, Surrey, in March 1867.  He was for many years resident at Chislehurst, Kent at a time when it was becoming a suburban district and he designed a number of houses there.  He died at Walpole, Manor Park, Chislehurst, Kent on 4 July 1882, and is buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church, Chislehurst.

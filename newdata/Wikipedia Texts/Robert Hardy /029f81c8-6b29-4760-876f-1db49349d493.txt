Robert Hardy (bassist)

Robert Byron "Bob" Hardy (born 16 August 1980) is an English musician and the bassist for the Glasgow-based band Franz Ferdinand.


== Biography ==
Hardy is an artist with an interest in music while Kapranos is a musician interested in art; this helped the two of them become 'firm' friends. Through Hardy's friends from the Glasgow School of Art, Kapranos developed an interest in the work of the Dadaists and the Russian Constructivists. After Hardy had met Nick McCarthy, whose girlfriend was also at the art school, the two began to date members of Hardy's year. Many of the earlier shows of the band would come about thanks to the band's art world contacts.Kapranos was provided with one bass guitar by his friend Mick Cooke, a member of the cult Glaswegian popsters, Belle & Sebastian on the condition that he "did something useful with it". Some time around the end of 2001, Bob Hardy received this one bass guitar from Alex Kapranos as Hardy leisured in Kapranos' kitchen in Glasgow. Kapranos conversed with Hardy about mastering the bass guitar.  Kapranos asked Hardy, "Do you want to learn to play the bass then, Bob?". Hardy replied, "No, I'm an artist, not a musician." Alex then responded in saying, "It's the same thing," which amused Hardy at that moment in time.  Bob Hardy is also a painter, a vegan, and likes grammar.

Robert Gathorne Hardy

Robert "Bob" Gathorne-Hardy (31 July 1902 – 11 February 1973) was an English garden writer.
Robert Gathorne-Hardy was the third of four sons of Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 3rd Earl of Cranbrook. He was educated at Eton College and was for forty years a resident of Stanford Dingley in Berkshire.
He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.Though he also wrote fiction (Lacebury Manor, Other Seas) and some bibliographical works, Gathorne-Hardy is best known for his books on plants that he researched while growing in the garden or about plants that he collected in different parts of the world. He called himself an amateur gardener, but in reality was no amateur. Gathorne-Hardy wrote about his own garden, his mother's garden, and that of his illustrator John Nash, each having their own point of view, their own distinct possibilities, and as he often said, ". . . their own snubs to give." He also worked- alongside his elder brother Edward- as a director of the booksellers Elkin Mathews. Gathorne-Hardy was made a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1960.Gathorne-Hardy's sister, Anne (1911-2006), was the wife of George Heywood Hill, owner of the Mayfair bookshop bearing his name. A nephew- son of his younger brother Anthony- was Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy.

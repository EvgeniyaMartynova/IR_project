Vasanthakumar, director of the Tamil film Machi approached her to enact the lead female role in the film, having seen her photos. After starring in the Tamil films Thirudiya Idhayathai and Shanmuga in the following months, which all proved to be very unsuccessful at the box-office, failed to attract people and hence, went totally unnoticed, she got to enter the Kannada film industry with the 2006 film Jackpot. Afterwards, she appeared in several Kannada films, including Chanda, Moggina Manasu and Slum Bala and was able to make her mark there, with people beginning to take notice of her. Lately, she appeared in Anjadiru, the Kannada remake of the 2008 Tamil hit film Anjaathe, and in Thakath.

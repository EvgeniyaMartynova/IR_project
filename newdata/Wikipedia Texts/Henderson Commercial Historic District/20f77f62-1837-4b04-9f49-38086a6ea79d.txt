Boston has been the site of several significant Masonic buildings.
In 1830, the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts bought land on Tremont Street to build a Masonic Temple. A building was constructed on the site and dedicated in 1832, but initially could not be owned by the Grand Lodge because of legal limitations on the value of real estate that the Grand Lodge could hold. Masons used the Masonic Temple for meetings until 1858, when the building was sold to the U.S. government for use as a courthouse.  The building lent its name to the Temple School, established by Bronson Alcott, which was housed in the building during the 1830s. The 1832 Masonic Temple, located at the corner of a street named Temple Place, also held a concert hall and was the site of many public lectures by Ralph Waldo Emerson, including his reading of The Transcendentalist in 1842. Following its sale to the government, it housed a courthouse until 1885.
Beginning in 1859, Boston's Masons occupied a building at the corner of Tremont and Boylston Streets that was known as Winthrop House, and that was rededicated as "Freemason's Hall" in December 1859. That building was destroyed by fire in April 1864. A grand new Masonic Temple building, designed by Merrill G. Wheelock, was built in its place on the same site and dedicated in 1867.Also in Massachusetts:

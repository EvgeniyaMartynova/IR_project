Hexanchus vitulus

The Atlantic sixgill shark (Hexanchus vitulus) is a rare species of hexanchid shark found in the Atlantic Ocean. It was formerly described as its own species, but was fused eventually with the bigeye sixgill shark (Hexanchus nakamurai). However, a study published in 2018 resurrected the species on the basis of molecular data. The species can be physically differentiated from the bigeye sixgill by its much smaller size.

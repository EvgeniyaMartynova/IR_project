Caffey, along with the nearby Caffey Corner, was a lumber settlement at 46°10′08″N 85°11′07″W. It is on H-40. West of Caffey, H-40 is also known as the Hiawatha Trail. At Caffey Corner, the Hiawatha Trail branches off to the south to end at US 2 east of Epoufette.  H-40 continues east from Caffey approximately seven miles to Trout Lake and from there on to Rudyard just west of I-75. Its station on the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway was originally called "Lewis", but because at the time there was another post office named Lewis in Michigan, it was given a post office named "Caffey", after the Pennsylvania-born Civil War veteran, William N. Caffey, who became the first postmaster in November 1899. The office closed in September 1909 and re-opened with Caffey as postmaster in June 1913. The post office closed permanently in December 1916.
Epoufette is an unincorporated community in the township on US 2 on Lake Michigan at 46°03′20″N 85°10′06″W. In 1848, a government surveyor, John R. McLeod, found an Ojibwe village here. Amable Goudreau began a commercial fishing business here in 1859, but it did not get a post office until lumbering operations began. McLeod became the first postmaster in December 1879. The name, French for "place of rest", was given by early French settlers because it was believed that Father Jacques Marquette used the harbor as the first step on his trip down Lake Michigan from St. Ignace. A historical marker commemorating the fishing village was erected in 1986. A summer post office operated here from 1959–1965 and 1966-1972.
Fiborn Quarry was a settlement around a limestone quarry.
Most of the township is served by the 49762 ZIP code for Naubinway in adjacent Hudson Township. The northwest portion of the township is served by the 49793 ZIP code for Trout Lake in Chippewa County.

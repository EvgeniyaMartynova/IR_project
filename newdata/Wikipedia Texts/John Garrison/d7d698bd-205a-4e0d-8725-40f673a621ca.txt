John Garrison (musician)

John Garrison (born 1973) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer. Co-founder of the British alternative rock band Budapest, he recorded and performed with them from 1999 to 2006. After the band split, he launched a career as a solo artist and released two albums Above The Cosmos and Departures. His most recent musical project is called Satellites from which two eponymous albums have been released and a third one is currently being completed. In parallel to his solo career, Garrison is a session bass player for other major label artists in the studio and on the road.


== Early life ==
Garrison was born in Liverpool, then moved to Coventry, England, at the age of one. His father was the head of music at University of Warwick and John grew up surrounded by music with easy access to orchestral instruments. His mother and two sisters are opera singers. He performed his first ever gig at the age of three playing the piano with his sister. Determined to be self-taught, he refused to take music lessons.


== Career ==
Garrison settled in New York City after Budapest broke up in 2006. His first solo albums Above the  Cosmos and Departures were released independently and received critical acclaim. A small number of gigs have been performed in the United States and Europe.The whole Satellites project started soon after John became a father and had moved to Copenhagen. The name was chosen because "satellites just report back what they see. They never stay in one place and they don't really belong anywhere". In fact, it's not a band but one man, Johnny Vic, who writes, plays and produces as Satellites.


== Personal life ==
John is now based in Copenhagen, Denmark where he lives with his Danish girlfriend and their son.

== Formation ==
Trimble and Halliday first met while attending Bangor Grammar School; the pair later met Baird while he was flirting with girls who were known to his future bandmates. The three first performed as a band at the age of 16 on ATL Rock School under the name Life Without Rory; the band finished in last place. Life Without Rory recorded three demos before disbanding; the first, "Safe in Silence" and the second, "Conscripted By Choice" are still on the band's inactive MySpace page, while the third "You Missed the Point" can be viewed on YouTube.Trimble, Halliday and Baird formed another band shortly after the demise of their first musical project; on this occasion, a permanent drummer was not included. An interim drummer by the name of Owen Bullington was appointed but was kicked out due to creative differences. The new band's name was taken from Halliday's mispronunciation of the name of the local cinema, the Tudor Cinema; in 2007, Two Door Cinema Club was formed. Following an increased interest in the band's social network page, the three members forewent their university places and commenced work on studio material.

== History ==
The establishment was built in 1930 in Spanish baroque style by Atlanta architecture firm Daniell & Beutell and opened on June 2, 1930. Primarily functioning as a second-run movie theater, it also hosted civic functions and concerts of the Buckhead Symphony Orchestra. It was operated by Affiliated Theaters, a subsidiary of McLendon Theatres. Lease holders Davis & Coart sold the lease in 1935 to the company Terry McDaniel of Montgomery.
In 1961, it converted to a first run policy and joined the Weis Theater chain as the Capri Theatre. In the mid-1980s, it was called Buckhead Cinema ‘N’ Drafthouse, until it was converted into the Coca-Cola Roxy Theatre.A significant Atlanta concert venue in the 1990s and most of the 2000s, the Roxy finally closed after LiveNation and Clear Channel ended their lease in 2008. It was then purchased by Aaron's, Inc., founder Charles Loudermilk. After two years of renovation, the venue reopened in June 2010 under the original name Buckhead Theatre.

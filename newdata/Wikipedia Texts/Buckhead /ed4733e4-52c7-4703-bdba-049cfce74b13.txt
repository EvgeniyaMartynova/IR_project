Buckhead (TV series)

Will Packer Productions is an American film and television production company founded and operated by Will Packer.


== History ==
Packer began his film career at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) with film director Rob Hardy when they started Rainforest Films in 1994. After producing profitable self-distributed independent films, Packer helped broker a major distribution deal with Sony in 2001. Packer produced several small budget, box office hits for Rainforest Films, including the box office number one films Stomp the Yard, Obsessed, Takers, Think Like a Man and Ride Along. In July 2013, Packer launched Will Packer Productions and signed a two-year deal with Universal Television to develop new projects for the studio.  Later that year, he signed a three-year "first-look" deal with Universal Pictures. Packer and Hardy mutually dissolved Rainforest Films in June 2014. It was reported that the last Will Packer-produced film that would appear under the Rainforest Film's banner was About Last Night. Think Like a Man Too, No Good Deed, The Wedding Ringer and Ride Along 2 (all Will Packer-produced films that were in development, filming or in post-production at the time of Rainforest Films dissolution) will fall under the new shingle Will Packer Productions.

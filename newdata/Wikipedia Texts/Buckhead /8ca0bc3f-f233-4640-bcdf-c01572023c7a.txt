== History ==
Buckhead was opened on June 8, 1996, the same day as Medical Center Station and Dunwoody Station. When State Route 400 was being constructed south of the perimeter in 1993, space was left that allowed track to be laid in the median from Buckhead all the way to Medical Center.  In 2014, new pedestrian bridges were built across both sides of State Route 400, allowing better access to the Stratford on the east and Tower Place on the west.

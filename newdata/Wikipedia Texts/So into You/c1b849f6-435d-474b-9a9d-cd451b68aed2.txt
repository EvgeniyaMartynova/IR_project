It did best in Canada, where it reached number two on the Pop singles chart, blocked from the top spot only by "Hotel California". "So in to You" was also a hit on the Adult Contemporary charts of both nations.  It reached number 11 on the U.S. AC chart and number 12 on the Canadian AC chart.In "So in to You," the singer admits an instant and mysteriously compelling attraction to a stranger entering the room, and is unable to focus on anything else.  He attempts to gain the stranger's attention, hoping that they will be able to make a personal connection and that the "vibe" he feels will be mutual.

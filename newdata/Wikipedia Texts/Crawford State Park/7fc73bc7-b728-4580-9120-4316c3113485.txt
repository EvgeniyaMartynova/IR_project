Crawford State Park (Kansas)

Crawford State Park is a state park in Crawford County, Kansas, United States, located 9 miles (14 km) north of Girard.
The 500-acre (200 ha) park, resides on a 150-acre (61 ha) lake built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s. There are two recorded archaeological sites within the park's boundaries, including remnants of a 19th-century U.S. military outpost. An interpretive trail connects the park with the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks' Farlington Fish Hatchery, which was built shortly after the CCC completed construction of the lake.
Anglers enjoy excellent fishing for channel catfish, crappie, and striped bass. Pleasure boating and scuba diving are among favorite recreational pursuits.
Located on the edge of the Ozarks, Crawford State Park illustrates the variety of landscapes available in Kansas. Redbud trees offer spectacular beauty in spring, and the lush foliage of the surrounding forest is a naturalist's delight.

Osiou Gregoriou monastery

Osiou Gregoriou monastery (Greek: Μονή Οσίου Γρηγορίου) is an Orthodox Christian monastery in the monastic state of Mount Athos in Greece. The monastery ranks seventeenth in the hierarchy of the Athonite monasteries. The monastery is built by the sea, on the southeastern side of the peninsula. Its close neighbours are Simonospetros and St Pauls Monasteries.  Gregoriou is very much a pilgrim friendly monastery with a strong pastoral sense. Pilgrim visitors are high and well provided for. The choir singing is very traditional Byzantine chanting and is one of the highest standards on Mt Athos, with perhaps only Vatopedi outdoing it.  When one visits Gregoriou and stays there for a few days one can feel like the monastery is almost completely girt by the sea, built as it is on a corner of land jutting into the sea, with only steep craggy rocks backed up behind it.

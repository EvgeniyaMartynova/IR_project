Robert J. Gay

Robert Joseph Gay is an American Paleontologist known for his work in the Chinle and Kayenta Formations in the southwest United States. He is known for the discovery of the first occurrence of Crosbysaurus from Utah, as well as his studies of cannibalism in Coelophysis and sexual dimorphism in Dilophosaurus. Since 2014, Gay has taken high school students to the Chinle of Comb Ridge, Utah, and he is currently making new discoveries there. In December 2017, he and coauthors Xavier A. Jenkins of Arizona State University and John R. Foster of the Museum of Moab formally published their study on the oldest known dinosaur from Utah, a neotheropod that is likely an animal similar to Coelophysis. Robert Gay is currently the Education Director at the Colorado Canyons Association.

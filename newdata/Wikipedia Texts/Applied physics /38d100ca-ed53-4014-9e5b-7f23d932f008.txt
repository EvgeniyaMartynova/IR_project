=== Season 1 (1995) ===

Fox changed the intended order of the episodes, beginning with episodes they thought would draw in audiences. This often causes confusion and sometimes chronological errors in continuity with respect to the story arc (for example, episode 5 "Prince of Wails" opens with the resolution to the cliffhanger brought about in episode 6 "Summer of Love"). The intended and filmed order of the episodes is as follows:


=== Season 2 (1996) ===
As in Season 1, Fox again broadcast the episodes out of their intended order, this time even changing the finale. The producers' intended order is as follows:


=== Season 3 (1996–97) ===
Again, Fox aired this season's episodes out of order. For instance, "Double Cross" was filmed as the premiere for Season Three. In this episode, the audience learns why the Sliders will now be able to slide anywhere between San Francisco and L.A. However, Fox opted to air "Rules of the Game" first, since it was a more action-oriented episode. The proper viewing order is as follows:


=== Season 4 (1998–99) ===


=== Season 5 (1999–2000) ===


== Home releases ==
At present, the following DVD sets have been released by Universal Home Video.


== Notes ==
Episode titles for season one were not shown on screen; they come from production scripts.
The episodes "Last Days" and "The Weaker Sex" are missing from streaming service.

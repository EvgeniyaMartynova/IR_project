Hohe Villerspitze

The Hohe Villerspitze is a mountain, 3,087 m (AA), in the Southeastern Sellrain Mountains (Südöstlichen Sellrainer Bergen), a sub-group of the northern Stubai Alps in the Austrian state of Tyrol. The mountain has three tops that, together, form an isolated, massive and prominent rocky summit made of amphibolite. Due to its geographic dominance and easily accessibility the Villerspitze is a fairly frequently visited lookout mountain, but it is not one to be underestimated. The southwestern rock tower has a height of 3,087 m (AA), the middle one is 3,081 m (AA) and the northwestern top is 3,024 m (AA). A prominent arête runs south from the summit.

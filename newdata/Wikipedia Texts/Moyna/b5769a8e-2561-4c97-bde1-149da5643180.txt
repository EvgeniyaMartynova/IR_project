== History ==
According to Binoy Ghosh, the ancient or even the medieval history of Moyna or Moynagarh is mired in controversy and uncertainties. Some enthusiasts of local history believe that Moyna was the birth-place and capital of Lau Sen. The question that comes up in this regard is that Lau Sen's existence is yet to be established historically. He remains a mythical king. Similarly, there are various complications about the origin of the name. Setting aside these controversies, we can take up certain points from comparatively more recent history. Let us focus on the 15th century during Muslim rule. Gobardhanananda Samanta was the founder of the Moyna raj family. He was a sixth generation descendant of Kalindiram Samanta, who was a general of the Utkal kings. During his rule there was a dacoit named Sri Dhar, who had a Robin Hood imge. The Utkal king could not collect any rent from Sri Dhar, and Gobardhanananda Samanta also failed to pay his rent on time. He was imprisoned by the Utkal king but Gobardhanananda Samanta's passion for music charmed him and he was released with due honours. He ultimately succeeded in eliminating Sri Dhar.

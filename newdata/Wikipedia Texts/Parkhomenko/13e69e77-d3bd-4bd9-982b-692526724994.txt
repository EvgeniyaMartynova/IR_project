Seryoga

Sergey Vasilyevich Parkhomenko (Russian: Серге́й Васи́льевич Пархо́менко, Sergey Vasil'evich Parkhomenko; Belarusian: Сяргей Васільевіч Пархоменка, Syarhyey Vasilyevich Parkhomyenka; born October 8, 1976) is a Belarusian rapper and the owner of the KingRing record label.


== Career ==
Seryoga was born Sergey Vasilyevich Parkhomenko in Gomel, Belarus. The moniker "Seryoga" derives from his first name, Sergey, and is one of the nickname forms commonly used for that name. As a child, Seryoga grew up in a rough neighborhood; his music became a combination of the Russian folk tradition of chastushki, which features song-poems with rapid fire rhyming lyrics, with modern beats and rap-style lyrics appealing to youth. In press releases, this style was called спортивные частушки (sports chastushki).
Before his solo career Seryoga was part of "Контра да Банда" (Kontra da Banda), a hip-hop group that was established in 2001 in Gomel. He also was part of the ТТ-34 group for several months and later participated in the group's music video for the song "Бум" (Boom).
Seryoga released his first solo single "Загубили Лялю" (Ruined Laila) in the summer of 2002. In 2003, the record label "Монолит" (Monolit) released the CD Maxi single of "Загубили Лялю" with 5 tracks in Russia and Belarus.
After he first appeared on Ukrainian television with music videos for "Загубили Лялю" and "Кукла" (Doll), Serygoa was dubbed the "Slavic Eminem" by the media.
In February 2004, Seryoga started a show on the Ukrainian music channel М-1. In April 2004, the record label MFG/BMG Ukraine released Seryoga's debut solo album "Мой двор: свадьбы & похороны" (My neighborhood: weddings & funerals) in the Ukraine. The album was simultaneously released in the Belarus by the record label Go Records. The album came out several weeks later in Russia, where it was titled "Мой двор. Спортивные частушки" (My neighborhood. Sports chastushki).
Seryoga's popularity soared with the release of his third single, "Чёрный Бумер" (Chyorniy Bumer, meaning Black Beemer). The "Чёрный Бумер" music video was shot in the summer of 2004 by Ukrainian director Vladimir Yakimenko (Pistolet Film) and premiered on September 15, 2004 in Kiev, Ukraine. This song and video were immediately nominated for the MTV Russia Russian Music Awards in the categories "best hip-hop project of the year" and "best debut of the year". By the end of 2004, "Чёрный Бумер" became the top hit on MTV's music charts for Russia.
In March 2005, the music video for the song "King Ring" was shot in Kiev. The song was written for the feature film "Shadowboxing" and included on its soundtrack. Later that year, Seryoga released a new music video for the song "Дискомалярия" (Disco malaria). In the video, a shift in Seryoga's public persona can be seen, with him moving away from his "ordinary guy" image to more of a glamorized hip-hop artist image.
In the beginning of 2006, the film Day Watch came out in theaters, the sequel to the blockbuster hit Night Watch from two years earlier. The film's soundtrack featured Seryoga's new song "Мел судьбы или Песня Тамерлана" (Mel sudby ili Pesnya Tamerlana, English: "Chalk of Destiny or Timur's song") as the theme song.
In Germany, Seryoga gained popularity after he collaborated on the song "2 Kaiser" with the German rapper Azad. After a successful collaboration with Azad, Seryoga worked together with the German rapper Megaloh and also recorded the song "In Da City" with German rap group Culcha Candela.Seryoga's song King Ring was chosen by Rockstar Games to be the background music of the Third Trailer for their hit video game Grand Theft Auto IV, titled Move up, Ladies and is also featured in the game on its "Vladivostok FM" radio station. He was also contracted to compose a track for The Music of Grand Theft Auto IV (the music CD included with the special edition of GTA IV) entitled Liberty City: The Invasion, which is also featured on the in-game radio station.
Seryoga provided the voice acting of Moto Moto in the Russian dubbed Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa movie.
His song "Дискомалярия" can be briefly heard in the 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon during a scene in which the protagonists accompany Russian cosmonauts in a Russian bar, although it did not appear on the film's official soundtrack. His song "2 Kaiser" can also be heard in the 2014 film The Equalizer in the scene where the protagonist Robert McCall confronts a Russian pimp and his men in a Russian restaurant.

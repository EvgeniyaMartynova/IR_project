Hughes & Kettner, up until recently, relied on its flagship TriAmp and Statesman family of amplifiers.  Recently, however, Hughes & Kettner has worked to establish itself in the high-gain 50-100 watt amp head market.  With the recent release of the Coreblade amplifier head, Hughes & Kettner is spending most of its resources in this market.
In September 2011, Hughes & Kettner released the Tubemeister 18, an 18-watt, 5 kilograms (11 lb), head. Meant to appeal to the gigging guitarist that values versatility and mobility, this amplifier is small and works best with smaller cabinets, generally in the area of one or two 12-inch (300 mm) speakers. The amp has received a lot of attention for its "Power Soak" feature, which enables the player to leave volume and gain levels high yet limit the output of the head to more reasonable levels. It is clearly designed by Hughes & Kettner to attend to the guitarists that perform consistently at a variety of volumes, even sporting a "red box" output (XLR) and the option to mute the speaker output entirely (intended for mixing desks).

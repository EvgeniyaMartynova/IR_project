== History ==
The constituency was created for the 2010 general election in which it was won by Labour's Glenda Jackson with a majority of 42 votes being the most marginal result in England; one smaller majority nationally was achieved, in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Hampstead and Kilburn was in 2010 the closest three-way marginal seat as the third-placed candidate obtained 841 fewer votes than the winner, approximately 1% of the electorate.  In January 2013, Glenda Jackson announced that she would not seek re-election, one of 37 of her party's MPs who did so in the 2015 general election.
The seat was won by Labour candidate Tulip Siddiq.  The 2015 result made the seat the 10th narrowest result of the party's 232 seats (by majority percentage).  Comparing the 2015 election to the 2010 election, the Liberal Democrat share of the vote fell by 25.6% which compared to a national negative swing for the party of 15.2%.

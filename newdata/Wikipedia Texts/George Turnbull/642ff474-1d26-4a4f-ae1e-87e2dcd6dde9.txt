George Turnbull (footballer)

George Edward Turnbull (active 1930–33) was an English footballer who played as a centre forward or inside left in the Football League for Rochdale and Darlington.Turnbull was born in Sunderland, which was then in County Durham. After a trial with Newcastle United early in the 1930–31 season, he signed for Rochdale. He played ten matches in the Third Division North, scoring twice, and was prolific in reserve-team matches, but after the club finished 21st out of 22 in the league and were obliged to seek re-election, he was one of many released in what the Northern Daily Mail called a "clean sweep of their players". He joined divisional rivals Darlington in August 1931, and scored once in five appearances at the beginning of the season, but the club cancelled his registration in October.In the 1932–33 season, he played local football in the Sunderland area for Bank Head Albion, as well as for Wearside League clubs Shiney Row Swifts and Easington Colliery Welfare.

In the course of his early academic life he became a member of the Church of England and was baptised at Bratton Parish Church in 1832.

From 1875 he was also Archdeacon of York, Toronto.After ending his career in Toronto, Whitaker retired to his home county of Wiltshire as Rector of Newton Toney, near Salisbury, England. He died in August 1882 and was buried at Newton Toney.

Whitaker was the eighth child of Philip Whitaker, a farmer of Bratton, Wiltshire, and his wife Anne Andrews. Two of the couple's older sons, Alfred and Edward, became solicitors, Alfred at Frome and Edward in London.

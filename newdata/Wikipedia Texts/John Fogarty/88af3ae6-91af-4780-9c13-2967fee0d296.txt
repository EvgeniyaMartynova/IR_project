Following an unsuccessful search for a Champ Car ride, Fogarty moved into sports car racing, driving for Flying Lizard Motorsports in the American Le Mans Series in 2005, finishing third in the GT2 drivers' championship with Johannes van Overbeek. He made only a handful of starts in 2006.

Fogarty and Gurney finished second in the championship standings in 2008, with one victory and eight top-five finishes. In 2009, they earned their second Daytona Prototype championship in a season that saw the number 99 GAINSCO Riley Pontiac score four victories and six pole positions.

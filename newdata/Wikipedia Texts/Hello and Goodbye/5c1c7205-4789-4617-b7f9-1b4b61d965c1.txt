== Production ==
Darryl F. Zanuck had a long history of trying to turn his European mistresses into film stars - he had previously done this with Bella Darvi, Juliette Greco and Irma. Hello Goodbye was created as a vehicle for his latest girlfriend Genevieve Gilles. It was the first production Zanuck personally supervised since The Longest Day (1962). Filming started on the French Riviera under the direction of Ronald Neame. He quit the film after a few weeks due to disagreements with Zanunck. He was replaced by Jean Negulesco who only did the movie as a favor to Zanuck.


== Box Office ==
According to Fox records, the film required $7,225,000 in rentals to break even. It failed to do so; by 11 December 1970, the film had only made $2,335,000.

Freeman Cruisers

Freeman Cruisersâ„¢ was a British manufacturer of cabin cruisers that was active between the years of 1957 and 1983. It took its name from its founder, John Freeman. Freeman had been previously manufacturing caravans and towing trailers before Second World War broke out, but production ceased due to the war. In 1983, the assets of the company were sold to Sheridan Marine, which still produces spare parts and sells used boats from their boatyard in Moulsford, Oxfordshire. Over 28 models of boat were produced by the company, and they are frequently seen on the navigable waterways of the UK. In addition, Freeman Cruisers are easily able to go to sea, with a few slight modifications to their plumbing and flushing systems. 
The boats were constructed from high-quality materials including a fiberglass outer shell with gelcoat, and mahogany interior partitions. Some models were also equipped with flushing toilets and aft cabins.
The first Freeman model to be produced was the 22 Mk. 1. Most of the original series of models are modeled after the 22 Mk. 2, which has a distinctive step on its side decks. 


== Boat Nomenclature ==
Generally, the boat's model number corresponds to the boat's completed length in feet. A Freeman 23 is 23 feet long, for example. However, for a full list of models available, including their variations, visit the official Freeman Cruiser website.

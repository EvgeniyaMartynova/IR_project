== History and tourism ==
In 1532 Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán sent Captain Juan Fernández de Híjar to the province of El Tuito and crowned them to look for a place in order to found a villa. In this virtue, Fernández de Híjar with 25 soldiers marched south and founded on February 2, 1533 the Villa of Purification in the valley of Tecomatlán and also established the first chapel in the now state of Jalisco. Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, Purification belongs to a small province populated by Indians from Saulam, or Sayula, formed by the villages of Tenzitlán, Xirosto, Jew, Pampochin, Amborí, La Silla, Cuxmalán, Carrion and Melahuacan as the headboard. The conquest of this region is due to Francisco Cortés de San Buenaventura, in 1525, remaining within the province.

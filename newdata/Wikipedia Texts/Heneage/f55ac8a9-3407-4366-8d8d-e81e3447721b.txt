Heneage Wheeler

Heneage Gibbes Wheeler was a cricketer who played one first-class match for Somerset in 1904.
A son of Rev. William Hancock Wheeler, vicar of Berrow, Somerset, by his wife Margaretta Alice, daughter of Rev. Heneage Gibbes, M.D. and grand-daughter of Sir George Smith Gibbes, of Bath, M.D., a royal physician, Wheeler was born at Axbridge, Somerset on 24 February 1870 and died at Preston Village, Brighton, Sussex on 4 August 1965. His batting style is unknown and it is not known if he was a bowler. In his single game, a 12-a-side match against Oxford University that was subsequently determined to be of first-class status, he batted at No 11 in each innings and he did not bowl. He made innings of 3 and 5 and was out in both. He did not play first-class cricket again. 
In 1921, under the Air Ministry and Royal Aeronautical Society notices in Flight magazine (as well as in 'The Aeroplane' magazine and in 'Flight: The Aircraft Engineer and Airships' magazine) there was noted the engagement of "Major Heneage Gibbes Wheeler, late R.A.F, of Bexhill-on-Sea" to a "Florence Hayes of St Louis, U.S.A" . Their son, Heneage Gibbes Wheeler, was born 5 August 1926.

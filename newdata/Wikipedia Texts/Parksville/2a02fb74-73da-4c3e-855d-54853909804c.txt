== History ==
It is unknown the exact year that Parksville was settled, but Lemuel Martin settled there in 1800. William Parks moved there in the early 1800s. He and his son Elijah built mills and improved Parksville, and gained more respect than Martin, much to Martin's chagrin. He wanted to call it Martinville but the residents chose Parks, and the hamlet was named Parksville.

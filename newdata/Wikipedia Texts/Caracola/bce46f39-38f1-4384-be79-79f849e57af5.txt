Caracola (song)

"Caracola" (Spanish pronunciation: [kaɾaˈkola], "Conch") is a song recorded by the trio Tim, Nelly & Tony, better known as Los TNT. The song was written by Fina de Calderón. It is best known as the Spanish entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1964, in Copenhagen.
The entry marked two firsts in the Contest for Spain; it was the country's first Eurovision entry not to be sung by a soloist and also the first occasion on which the Spanish entry was sung by performers of Latin American origin. Los TNT was composed by three siblings of Italian-Uruguayan descent; Edelweiss "Tim" Croatto, lead singer Argentina "Nelly" Croatto and Hermes "Tony" Croatto, all born in Udine, Italy but raised in La Paz, Uruguay and Montevideo, Uruguay.
The song was performed sixteenth and last on the night, following Belgium's Robert Cogoi with "Près de ma rivière". At the close of voting, it had received 1 point, placing 12th in a field of 16.
It was succeeded as Spanish entry at the 1965 Contest by Conchita Bautista with "¡Qué bueno, qué bueno!".

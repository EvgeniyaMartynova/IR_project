He is most known for a being part of a tag team, first with White Man, Alberto Muñoz, who formed a fan favorite tag team. The two teamed for a while but never won a tag team title, despite several chances at the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. By 1978 Muñoz dropped the "White Man" character as he was forced to work a reduced schedule due to age and injuries.Later, Black Man would form Los Fantasticos with Kung Fu and Kato Kung Lee, a very popular trios team from the early 1980s. Black Man would later try to reform Los Fantasticos with Kendo and Avispon Negro, but the trio was never as popular as the originals.  He was once El Santo's high risk move double in a movie. Late in his career he worked under the ring name Celestial, complete with a new mask and outfit to not reveal his real identity.

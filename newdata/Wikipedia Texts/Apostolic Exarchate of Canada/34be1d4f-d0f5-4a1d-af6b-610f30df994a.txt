Syro-Malabar Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Canada

The Syro-Malabar Catholic Eparchy of Mississauga is an eparchy for all Syro-Malabar Catholics in Canada.
It comprises 12 churches and 34 missions.


== History ==
It was erected on 6 August 2015 by Pope Francis as a Syro-Malabar Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Canada. Until that time, Canadian Syro-Malabar faithful had been pastorally served by the neighbouring, US-based Syro-Malabar Diocese of Saint Thomas the Apostle of Chicago, in whose bishop, since its creation in 2001, was vested the office of Apostolic Visitor in Canada of the Syro-Malabars.
On December 22, 2018 it was elevated to the rank of eparchy.

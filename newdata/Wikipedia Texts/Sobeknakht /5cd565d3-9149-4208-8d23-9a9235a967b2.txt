Sobeknakht I

Sobeknakht I was an Ancient Egyptian official of the Second Intermediate Period. He was local governor at Elkab. Sobeknakht I is mainly known from the inscriptions in the tomb of the local governor Sobeknakht II as the father of the latter. Furthermore, from these inscriptions it is clear that the wife of Sobeknakht I was a woman with the title hereditary princess and the name Nofru. Not much else is known about Sobeknakht I. He is mentioned in the Juridical Stela. According to that, he became governor in year one of king Nebiryraw I. Only recently his tomb was identified at Elkab. The inscriptions in the tomb are only badly preserved, but the mentioning of a woman called Nofru and remains of titles typical for local governors make the identification very likely.

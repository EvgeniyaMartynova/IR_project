Big Sandy Creek (Cheat River tributary)

Big Sandy Creek is a 31.3-mile-long (50.4 km) mountain stream which begins in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, and flows into Preston County, West Virginia, in the United States. The Big Sandy flows through Bruceton Mills and Rockville, West Virginia, before crashing down the mountainside and reaching its confluence with the Cheat River at the abandoned town of Jenkinsburg.
The Big Sandy is a popular whitewater kayaking run, a destination for paddlers from many states in the late winter and early spring. The most commonly run section is the Class-V Lower Big Sandy, from Rockville to Jenkinsburg, which contains two runnable waterfalls: Wonder Falls (Class IV) and Big Splat (Class 5.1).

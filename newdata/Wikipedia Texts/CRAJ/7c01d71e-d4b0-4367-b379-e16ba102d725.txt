University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour

The University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour (L'Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour or UPPA) is a French multi-site, public university. Founded in 1972, it is based in Pau (département of Pyrénées-Atlantiques) but also in Bayonne, Tarbes and Mont-de-Marsan in the Adour river basin. Coming administratively under the Academy of Bordeaux, it is the third largest university in southwestern France (after Bordeaux and Toulouse), with some 12,000 students.
The University's logo is a stylised representation of the Pyrénées or the Pic du Midi d'Ossau, the blue triangle being the Atlantic ocean. The colors used (yellow, green blue) are those of the university's graphic charter.


== History ==
The university was founded in 1970, in a splendid formerly urban park. However, the origins of the Law faculty ('UFR de Droit, Economie et Gestion') go further back; it was created in 1947 by Robert Poplawski (dean from 1947 to 1953) and Dean Vizioz, and was lodged in Villa Lawrence in Pau town centre.

The university was led by the following presidents:


== Pau campus ==

With nearly 9,000 students, the Pau campus is the largest. The President's office is located there in the Présidence (Presidency) semicircular building. The campus is located to the north of Pau, about twenty minutes ride from the town centre, but within the urban limits. The campus is comprised in the space between Avenue de l'Université-Cours Léon Bérard-Boulevard Tourasse to the South, Avenue du Doyen Poplawski to the West, rue Audrey Benghozi and Boulevard Lucien Favre to the North and Allées Condorcet to the East.
This campus has three departments (unités de formation et de recherche (UFR)) of Arts, Law and Sciences, as well as a technological institute (Institut Universitaire Technologique), the Ecole Nationale Supérieure en Génie de Technologies Industrielles (ENSGTI) and a School for Business Administration (Institut d'Administration des Entreprises)  with a satellite in Bayonne. There are two specialised university libraries, one for the Sciences Department, the other common to the Law and Arts Departments.

South lays a big lawn much appreciated by students during summer times.

The department is lodged in a three storeys elaborate building with the amphitheatre-like classrooms being grouped at the eastern corner of the complex. The inner infrastructure is made of unpainted crude supporting concrete walls with lighter separation plaster painted walls. The exterior roofing is made of small clay tiles.
Brick is also used for the sculptural elements like the well-like artificial space in the center of the inner patio, as well as pebbles for floor decoration. Large glass bays are also used as separation elements.
The department features a number of landmarks. The pillar-shape archives room near the student secretary is called 'the lighthouse', the sculpture-like structure in the patio is called 'the well', and the underground part of the building is referred to as 'the cellar'. The coffee-machines place and the eaves of the building are popular meeting points.

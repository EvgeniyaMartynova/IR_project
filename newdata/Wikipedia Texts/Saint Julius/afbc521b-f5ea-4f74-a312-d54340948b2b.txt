Saint Julius the Veteran

Saint Julius the Veteran (Latin: Iulius), also known as Julius of Durostorum, is a Roman Catholic, Anglican and Eastern Orthodox saint and martyr. His feast day is 27 May. 


== Life ==
Julius of Durostorum was born to pagan parents and served as a Roman soldier for 27 years. Although a veteran of several military campaigns, he converted to Christianity and was denounced by his fellow soldiers.  
Under the Diocletian Persecution, the examining prefect, Maximus, tried to bribe the veteran into denouncing his faith. Julius declined, and he and seven others were beheaded in Durostorum, the Roman camp in Moesia Inferior (modern Silistra,  Bulgaria) and died as martyrs.

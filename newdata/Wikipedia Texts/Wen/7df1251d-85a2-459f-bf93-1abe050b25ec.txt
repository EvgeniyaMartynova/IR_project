Wen (surname)

Wen is the pinyin romanisation shared by several different Chinese surnames, including 文 (Wén), 温 (Wēn), 闻, and 问 (Wèn).
文 (Wén), meaning "literary" or "culture", is usually romanised as Man in Cantonese (most widely used by those from Hong Kong), and sometimes as Mann. In Min (including the Hokkien, Teochew, and Taiwanese dialects), the name is pronounced Boon. In the Hakka, the name can be romanized as Vun or Voon. The Gan dialect transcription for the name is Mun. Other romanizations include Văn in Vietnamese, Moon or Mun (Hangul: 문) in Korean and Bun (Hiragana: ぶん) in Japanese.
温 (Wēn), meaning "warm", is sometimes romanised as Wen or Vun in Taiwan, On in Vietnamese, Wan in Cantonese, or Wen/Won/Wan/Bong/Voon/Oon/woon/Man/Mun in Malaysia.
闻 (Wén), meaning "fame" or "to listen", shares its origin with 文 (Wén) and usually romanised in a similar way. It may be romanised as Man in Cantonese, Wen, Boon, Vun, or Voon in Taiwan, Văn in Vietnamese.

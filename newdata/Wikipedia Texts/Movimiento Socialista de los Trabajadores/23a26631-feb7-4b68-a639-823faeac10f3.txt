Workers' Socialist Movement (Argentina)

The Workers' Socialist Movement (Spanish: Movimiento Socialista de los Trabajadores, MST) is a Trotskyist (left-wing socialist) political party in Argentina. The MST was founded in 1992 as a split from another Trotskyist group, the Movement Towards Socialism (see Nahuel Moreno). The MST is active on a number of college campuses, including the University of Buenos Aires. The party in 2006 has suffered a crisis which led to a split. The minority founded a new organization, named 'Socialist Left' (Izquierda Socialista).

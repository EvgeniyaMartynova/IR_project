Carathéodory–Jacobi–Lie theorem

The Carathéodory–Jacobi–Lie theorem is a theorem in symplectic geometry which generalizes Darboux's theorem.


== Statement ==
Let M be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold with symplectic form ω. For p ∈ M and r ≤ n, let f1, f2, ..., fr be smooth functions defined on an open neighborhood V of p whose differentials are linearly independent at each point, or equivalently

  
    
      
        d
        
          f
          
            1
          
        
        (
        p
        )
        ∧
        …
        ∧
        d
        
          f
          
            r
          
        
        (
        p
        )

        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle df_{1}(p)\wedge \ldots \wedge df_{r}(p)\neq 0,}
  where {fi, fj} = 0. (In other words, they are pairwise in involution.) Here {–,–} is the Poisson bracket. Then there are functions fr+1, ..., fn, g1, g2, ..., gn defined on an open neighborhood U ⊂ V of p such that (fi, gi) is a symplectic chart of M, i.e., ω is expressed on U as

  
    
      
        ω
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        d
        
          f
          
            i
          
        
        ∧
        d
        
          g
          
            i
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega =\sum _{i=1}^{n}df_{i}\wedge dg_{i}.}
  


== Applications ==
As a direct application we have the following. Given a Hamiltonian system as 
  
    
      
        (
        M
        ,
        ω
        ,
        H
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (M,\omega ,H)}
   where M is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   and H is the Hamiltonian function, around every point where 
  
    
      
        d
        H
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle dH\neq 0}
   there is a symplectic chart such that one of its coordinates is H.

Carathéodory's existence theorem

In mathematics, Carathéodory's existence theorem says that an ordinary differential equation has a solution under relatively mild conditions. It is a generalization of Peano's existence theorem. Peano's theorem requires that the right-hand side of the differential equation be continuous, while Carathéodory's theorem shows existence of solutions (in a more general sense) for some discontinuous equations. The theorem is named after Constantin Carathéodory.

Consider the differential equation

        y
        (
        t
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle y'(t)=f(t,y(t))}
  with initial condition

  
    
      
        y
        (
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
        )
        =

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle y(t_{0})=y_{0},}
  where the function ƒ is defined on a rectangular domain of the form

  
    
      
        R
        =
        {
        (
        t
        ,
        y
        )
        ∈

  Peano's existence theorem states that if ƒ is continuous, then the differential equation has at least one solution in a neighbourhood of the initial condition.However, it is also possible to consider differential equations with a discontinuous right-hand side, like the equation

  
    
      
        
          y
          ′

        H
        (
        t
        )
        ,
        
        y
        (
        0
        )
        =
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle y'(t)=H(t),\quad y(0)=0,}
  where H denotes the Heaviside function defined by

  
    
      
        H
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  0
                  ,
                
                
                  
                    if 
                  
                  t
                  ≤
                  0
                  ;

        s
        =
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  0
                  ,
                
                
                  
                    if 
                  
                  t
                  ≤
                  0
                  ;
                
              
              
                
                  t
                  ,
                
                
                  
                    if 
                  
                  t
                  >
                  0
                
              
            
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y(t)=\int _{0}^{t}H(s)\,\mathrm {d} s={\begin{cases}0,&{\text{if }}t\leq 0;\\t,&{\text{if }}t>0\end{cases}}}
  as a solution of the differential equation. Strictly speaking though, it does not satisfy the differential equation at 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=0}
  , because the function is not differentiable there. This suggests that the idea of a solution be extended to allow for solutions that are not everywhere differentiable, thus motivating the following definition.
A function y is called a solution in the extended sense of the differential equation 
  
    
      
        
          y
          ′
        
        =
        f
        (
        t
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle y'=f(t,y)}
   with initial condition 
  
    
      
        y
        (
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
        )
        =
        
          y
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y(t_{0})=y_{0}}
   if y is absolutely continuous, y satisfies the differential equation almost everywhere and y satisfies the initial condition. The absolute continuity of y implies that its derivative exists almost everywhere.

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle y'(t)=A(t)y(t)+b(t),\quad y(t_{0})=y_{0}.}
  Here, the components of the matrix-valued mapping

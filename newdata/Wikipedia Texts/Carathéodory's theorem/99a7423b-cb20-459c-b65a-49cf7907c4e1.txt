Carathéodory's criterion

Carathéodory's criterion is a result in measure theory that was formulated by Greek mathematician Constantin Carathéodory. Its statement is as follows: Let 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda ^{*}}
   denote the Lebesgue outer measure on 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
  , and let 
  
    
      
        E
        ⊆
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
  .  Then 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   is Lebesgue measurable if and only if 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        A
        )
        =
        
          λ
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        A
        ∩
        E
        )
        +
        
          λ
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        A
        ∩
        
          E
          
            
              c
            
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda ^{*}(A)=\lambda ^{*}(A\cap E)+\lambda ^{*}(A\cap E^{\mathrm {c} })}
   for every 
  
    
      
        A
        ⊆
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
  .
Notice that 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is not required to be a measurable set.  
The Carathéodory criterion is of considerable importance because, in contrast to Lebesgue's original formulation of measurability, which relies on certain topological properties of 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  ,  this criterion readily generalizes to a characterization of measurability in abstract spaces.  Indeed, in the generalization to abstract measures, this theorem is sometimes extended to a definition of measurability.  Thus, we have the following definition:  Let 
  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}}
   be an outer measure on a set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  .  Then 
  
    
      
        E
        ⊂
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle E\subset X}
   is called 
  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}}
  –measurable if for every 
  
    
      
        A
        ⊂
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\subset X}
  , the equality 
  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        A
        )
        =
        
          μ
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        A
        ∩
        E
        )
        +
        
          μ
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        A
        ∩
        
          E
          
            
              c
            
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}(A)=\mu ^{*}(A\cap E)+\mu ^{*}(A\cap E^{\mathrm {c} })}
   holds.

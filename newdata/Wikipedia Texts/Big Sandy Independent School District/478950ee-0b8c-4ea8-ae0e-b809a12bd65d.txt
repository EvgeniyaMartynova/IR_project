The Big Sandy High School football team has won three Texas Class B (now Class A) state championships; 1973, 1974 (co-championship with Celina after the finals game ended in a 0-0 tie), and 1975. The 1975 team set a then national record of 824 points scored in a season (they went 14-0 for the regular season including playoffs), while giving up only 15 points (and only being behind in a game only one time, an early 2-0 deficit to Groom in the championship game, which also were the only points given up to any opponent in its three state title games). This record was not broken until 1994 by a high school in Bloomington, California. The 1975 team included later notable NFL stars such as David Overstreet, a former running back for the Oklahoma Sooners and the Miami Dolphins, and Lovie Smith, head coach for the NFL Chicago Bears.
In 2005, the Wildcats again reached the state final game (Class A, vs Stratford), however they fell short by one point (21-20).

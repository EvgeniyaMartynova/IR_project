== Reception ==
Colleen Moore's role in So Big quite different from her usual jazz baby/flapper parts. Because Moore's part in the film was so different from the roles she had become known for following Flaming Youth, there was an outcry against her. Forgotten was that, before her success in Flaming Youth, the vast majority of her roles had been dramatic in character, a few even tragic. She had not only played mothers, but mothers who had lost children (Broken Chains) and mothers who died (Dinty). Still, her performance generally was well received. The film, however, was not as big a success as her previous few comedies, and so Sally was lined up to follow So Big. Moore wrote in Silent Star that upon meeting Edna Ferber some years after the film, the author gave her approval of Moore's performance.

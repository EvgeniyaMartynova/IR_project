=== Animals ===
The animals featuring in the series are primarily species native to England, though more exotic species are occasionally mentioned. The first book explains that in the years following the disappearance of all humans, the animals of Welkin, both those wild and once domesticated, made their way into the abandoned castles and villages, using what the humans had left behind.
Gradually the animals learned to speak human language and, to an extent, use human tools. While some of the animals were content to live in the forest, the mustelids in particular adapted to a more civilized way of living.
The otters and mink took to the riverways; the badgers kept to the subterranean territories; the pine martens stayed in the trees; of the remaining weasels, stoats, and now-feral ferrets, the stoats were the most ambitious and aggressive, and took control of Welkin.


=== Common Terms ===
Titles – The weasels and stoats use the terms jack and jill to refer to males and females, respectively. In the second arc, the shortened forms Jal and Jis are used in the same way humans use the titles Mr. and Mrs.
Hollyhockers – A popular form of gambling involving seeds thrown onto a surface in various patterns


=== Important Locations ===


==== Medieval Era ====
Halfmoon Wood – The forest where Sylver and his bandits live
Castle Rayn – Prince Poynt's castle, once inhabited by the humans
The unnamed marshes – The land of the rats, ruled over by the mad stoat Flaggatis.


==== Victorian Era ====
Muggidrear – The capital city of Welkin. It is split in half by the river Bronn. The south side is occupied by the humans, and the north is occupied by the animals.
Whistleminster Palace – The castle where queen Amarjit Nandhra Ilford lives and where the royal family lives


=== Living Statues ===
The island of Welkin is populated not only by animals, but statues created by humans that have since come to life. The statues have the ability to talk, but most do so rather poorly and have only limited intelligence. All statues wander Welkin constantly in search of their "First and Last Resting Place," that being the quarry from which the stones they were sculpted from were cut, or the forest from which the trees used to carve them were grown.

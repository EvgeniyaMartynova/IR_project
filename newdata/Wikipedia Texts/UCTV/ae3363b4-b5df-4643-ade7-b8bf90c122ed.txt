Canal 13 (Chile)

Channel 13 is a Chilean free-to-air television channel. It was launched on 21 August 1959, on VHF channel 2 of Santiago, in a broadcast led by a group of engineers from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Subsequently, the TV station moved its frequency to VHF channel 13, which gave rise to its current name. In its beginnings, one of its most important milestones was the broadcast of the 1962 FIFA World Cup, held in Chile.
Owned by the Luksic Group, Channel 13 is the second oldest television station in Chile. It was named Corporación de Televisión de la Pontificia Universidad de Chile (Television Corporation of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile) until 2010. However, the station is known in Chile as El 13 (the thirteenth) since its inception. 
Its central studios are located in the Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte Television Centre, which houses the channel's production and broadcast facilities since the 1980s. The complex is located in Providencia, Metropolitan Region of Santiago and has 5 hectares of infrastructure. Since 1998, these dependencies have been named after the station's deceased executive director, Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte, who was one of the longest-serving men in this position.

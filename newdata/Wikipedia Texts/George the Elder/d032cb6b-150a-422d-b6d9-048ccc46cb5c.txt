== Bibliography ==
Adams was best known for A Treatise Describing the Construction and Explaining the Use of New Celestial and Terrestrial Globes (London: 1766). There were later editions, but the claim of 30 up to 1810 is not now accepted. Other works were:
Micrographia Illustrata, or the knowledge of the microscope explained (1746), which included "a translation of Mr. Joblott's observations on animalculæ", and had four editions to 1771. Henry Baker attacked this book, on grounds of plagiarism.
The Description and Use of a new Sea-quadrant for taking the altitude of the sun from the visible horizon (1748).
The Description and Use of the Universal Trigonometrical Octant, invented and applied to Hadley's Quadrant (1753).

Helgoland-class tug

The Type 720 Helgoland class tugs are large seagoing salvage tugs used by the German Navy. After the decommissioning of Helgoland, the class is now referred to as Fehmarn class in the German Navy. As with other auxiliary ship classes in Germany, these tugboats are manned by a civilian crew. The ships are named after the German islands Helgoland (Heligoland) and Fehmarn.

Punk's Not Dead (2007 film)

Punk's Not Dead is a 2007 documentary film directed by Susan Dynner, an American hardcore punk fan.  The film claims to infiltrate American clubs, malls, recording studios, etc. where it sets out to claim hardcore punk and pop punk music is "thriving" from an American perspective. Its content features performances largely from 1980s hardcore bands and MTV skate punk and pop punk/rock acts. It also includes various interviews and behind-the-scenes footage with the bands, labels and fans.

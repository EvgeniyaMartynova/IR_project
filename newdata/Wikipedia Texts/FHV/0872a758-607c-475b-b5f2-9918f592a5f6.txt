== History ==

The Ethan Allen Express began service between New York City and Rutland on December 2, 1996. It was the first passenger service on the line between Whitehall and Rutland since 1936. An infill station was opened at Fair Haven on November 12, 1997.The station building, originally built by the Delaware and Hudson Railway, was in poor condition and was not available for passenger use. Instead, Amtrak passengers used a small bus shelter located across the street from the building.
Fair Haven is a small town with limited tourist activity; in FY 2007 the station served just 2,205 passengers. In January 2010, Fair Haven station was replaced with Castleton station, 5 miles (8.0 km) to the east, which better serves Castleton University and Lake Bomoseen. Castleton station opened on January 2; Fair Haven remained in use until January 9.

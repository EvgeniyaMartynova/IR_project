The event was the result of the controversial arrest of Henry Louis Gates, which gained national attention regarding law enforcement racial profiling.Former US President George W. Bush, who claimed that he gave up drinking alcoholic beverages after turning 40, drank Buckler while relaxing with Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Tony Blair on June 8, 2007 during a break in the G8 summit.

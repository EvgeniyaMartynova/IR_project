Robert French (Irish judge)

Robert French (1690 – 29 May 1772) was an Irish judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He was extremely   unpopular  with his colleagues,   who thought poorly of  him  both  as a lawyer and a judge.
He was born in Liverpool,  and grew up in Dungar, now Frenchpark, County Roscommon. He was the second son of  the wealthy landowner Colonel John French, nicknamed An Tiarna Mór (the Great Lord). His mother was Anne Gore, daughter of Sir Arthur Gore, 1st Baronet and his wife Eleanor St. George. While his father's wealth and connections no doubt helped him in his career, he  also owed much to his mother's family, in particular to his uncle George Gore,  justice of the Court of Common Pleas.

He attended  the  local school in Roscommon,  matriculated from  the University of Dublin in 1708, took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1715 and was made Doctor of Law in 1730. He entered the Middle Temple in 1710 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1717. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Jamestown, County Leitrim from 1727 to 1745.In 1745 his uncle Mr Justice Gore  announced that he would retire from the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) on condition that French replace him. This put the Government  in an awkward position; Gore, although he was  not  regarded as an especially  good judge  was  personally very popular, whereas French was  a notoriously  bad lawyer and  personally a  most unpopular individual. However, since Gore was clearly unable to continue with his duties,  the Crown reluctantly agreed to appoint French. French's conduct as a judge fully  justified the official misgivings: an anonymous satire refers to "snarling, bridling, self-corroding French" and asked where his like for ignorance could be found.He retired in 1761 and died in 1772. His marriage to Frances, daughter of Sir Richard Hull was childless. He was buried in St. Michan's Church, Dublin.

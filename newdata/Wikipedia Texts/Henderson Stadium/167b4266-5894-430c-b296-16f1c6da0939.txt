Spitz Stadium

Spitz Stadium is a stadium in the Henderson Park of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.

It is used primarily for baseball. It is the home of the Lethbridge Bulls, a Western Major Baseball League team, and was the home of the Lethbridge Black Diamonds of the Pioneer League. The ballpark has a capacity of 3,000 people and was opened in 1975.
The City of Lethbridge renamed the stadium from Henderson Stadium in 2008, after it signed a 15-year agreement with Spitz, wherein Spitz received naming rights for that period and would provide $500,000 for renovation or upgrades until 2013.

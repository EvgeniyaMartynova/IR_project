Monastic houses in England include abbeys, priories and friaries, among other monastic religious houses.
This article provides a gazetteer for the whole of England.  Additionally, each county below provides links to the specific list for that county.


== Overview ==
The list is presented alphabetically by ceremonial county. Foundations are listed alphabetically within each county.

Communities/provenance: shows the status and communities existing at each establishment, together with such dates as have been established as well as the fate of the establishment after dissolution, and the current status of the site.
Formal name or dedication: shows the formal name of the establishment or the person in whose name the church is dedicated, where known.
Alternative names: some of the establishments have had alternative names over the course of time. To assist in text-searching such alternatives in name or spelling have been provided.
Monastic glossary: following the listing, provides links to articles on the particular monastic orders as well as other terms which appear in the listing.
Alien houses are included, as are smaller establishments such as cells and notable monastic granges (particularly those with resident monks), and also camerae of the military orders of monks (Knights Templars and Knights Hospitaller).  The numerous monastic hospitals per se are not included here unless at some time the foundation had, or was purported to have the status or function of an abbey, priory, friary or preceptor/commandery.
The name of the county is given where there is reference to an establishment in another county.  Where the county has changed since the foundation's dissolution the modern county is given in parentheses, and in instances where the referenced foundation ceased to exist before the unification of England, the kingdom is given, followed by the modern county in parentheses.

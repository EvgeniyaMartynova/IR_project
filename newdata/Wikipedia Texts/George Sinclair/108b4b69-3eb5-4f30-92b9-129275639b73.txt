George Sinclair (footballer)

George Leckie Sinclair (1889–1959) was a Scottish footballer, who played for Heart of Midlothian (Hearts), Dunfermline Athletic, Cowdenbeath  and Scotland.Born in 1889, he first signed for Hearts in the 1907/08 season. He was a traditional outside right (right winger). He went on to win three Scotland caps and also played three times for the Scottish League XI. In the 1914/15 season Hearts won their first 8 games to take a strong lead in the League.  As a reservist, George had pledged to join up and was one of the first to leave Hearts in August 1914.
Later the whole squad enlisted – the first British club to do so. Most of the players were with "C" Company of the Royal Scots – Sir George McCrae's Battalion. George served with the Royal Field Artillery and was injured in action.
George saw action at Mons and was one of the lucky ones who survived the war and returned to play for Hearts again, along with Paddy Crossan and Bob Mercer. In 1919 they reached the final of the Victory Cup. George continued to play football into the 1920s, including a spell in the United States. He went on to run Sinclair's Bar in Montrose Terrace at Abbeyhill until he died in 1959.

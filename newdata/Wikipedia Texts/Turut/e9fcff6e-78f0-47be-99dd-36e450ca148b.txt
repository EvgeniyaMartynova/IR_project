== "Plan Yapmayın Plan" ==
In his latest album, Dünya Tatlısı, released late 2007 contains a song named Plans, don't make any plans  (Turkish: Plan Yapmayın Plan), which has created a major controversy in Turkey.  
The lyrics take aim at Americans, Russians, Kurds, Christians, Armenians and the Turks who support them, telling them not to make plans against the Black Sea region of Turkey.  The lyrics praise  Ogün Samast and Yasin Hayal the alleged killers of the Armenian-Turkish journalist  Hrant Dink and end with "If a person betrays the country, he is finished off".Whereas the song does not name Ogün, Yasin and Hrant Dink explicitly, a video clip posted on YouTube shows images of Ogün, Yasin, and Hrant Dink throughout the song.Hakan Öztekin of Çarşamba claimed responsibility for making the video clip. He claims that he didn't have a political motive when creating the clip, but created the clip as a hobbyist.

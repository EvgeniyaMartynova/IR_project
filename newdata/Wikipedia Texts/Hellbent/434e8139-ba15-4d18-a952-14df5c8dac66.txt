Hell Bent (album)

Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound is the thirtieth studio album by country music artist Hank Williams, Jr. that was released by Elektra Records/Curb Records in November 1979, his fourth on the Elektra/Curb labels. The full-length album was Williams' second of 1979, with Family Tradition released in April.


== Reception ==
Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, his second consecutive Top 5 for the label and only his second Top 5 album since 1969's Live at Cobo Hall. It was certified Platinum by the RIAA, marking it as his third Gold album certification and his first Platinum album. The album generated two major hit singles, the title track and "Women I've Never Had", that peaked at number 2 and number 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and would become two of Williams' most well known and popular songs.
Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: "At times his son-of-an-outlaw obsession is worse than shtick, but here he does justice to the formula. Two candid songs about women tell you more about his sexism than he knows himself, two others explain why he's in that mood, the covers from Gregg Allman and George Jones define his parameters, and 'The Conversation'—with Waylon Guess Who, about Guess Who, Sr.—doesn't make you gag once." In 2006, CMT ranked it #16 on its list of the top 40 albums in country music history.

Castor of Karden

Saint Castor of Karden (German: Kastor von Karden) was a priest and hermit of the 4th century who is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church.  Castor was a pupil of Maximinus of Trier around 345 AD, and was ordained as a priest by Maximinus.  Like his teacher, Castor may have come from the region of Aquitaine.  At his ordination, Castor settled at Karden on the Moselle as a hermit with various companions, where they dedicated themselves to an ascetic life and established a small religious community.
Castor’s companions there included the Aquitanian pilgrim Saint Potentinus, and Potentinus’ two sons Felicius and Simplicius.Castor died at Karden at an advanced age.

The federation organizes all the European Cycling Championships (such as the European Road Championships and the European Track Championships) for all cycling disciplines, including road cycling, track cycling, cyclo-cross, BMX, mountain biking and indoor cycling and awards the UEC European Champion jersey to the European Champions.
In 2018, as part of the multi-sport European Championships, the UEC brought its four main European championships  - track, road, mountain bike and BMX - together for the first time as the 2018 European Cycling Championships.

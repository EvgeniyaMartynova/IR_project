The UEC has been criticised for its powers to abolish elections in conflict areas. The UEC's first chairman was Thein Soe, a former major-general, an appointment that was derided by media. On 18 February 2011, Tin Aye, a former lieutenant-general and member of the State Peace and Development Council, was appointed by the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, to replace Thein Soe.It has also been criticised by various advocacy groups and the United Nations for its lack of independence and impartiality, in its handling of recent elections. The UN has also noted the UEC's failure to follow up on electoral complaints, including voting procedures.

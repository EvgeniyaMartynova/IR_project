UEC Cup

The Computer Go UEC Cup was an annual worldwide computer Go tournament held at the University of Electro-Communications (UEC) in Tokyo, Japan since 2007 until 2017. The winners of the tournament would then play exhibition games against a professional Go player.
The tournament was typically structured as a preliminary Swiss-system invitational to determine challengers (with the previous year's UEC winners excluded), then a knockout tournament of sixteen players to determine the champion.
UEC Cup was terminated after its 10th edition in 2017 and was succeeded by AI Ryusei, a new computer Go tournament sponsored by Japanese Igo & Shogi Channel.

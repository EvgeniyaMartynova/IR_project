== History ==
The law establishing the electoral commission was promulgated in 1997. The first Electoral commission served from 1997 until 2002. The current commission came into office in 2016 for a seven-year term, renewable once only. This commission headed by Justice of the High Court, Simon Mugenyi Byabakama,  replaces that which was headed by Engineer Badru Kiggundu that served two terms (2002–2009 and 2009–2016). Other commissioners include Hajjat Aisha Lubega (vice chairperson) and commissioners Peter Emorut, Steven Tashobya, Justine Ahabwe Mugabi, Nathaline Etomaru and Mustapha Ssebaggala Kigozi. During their first year in office, they organised and supervised by-elections. The first nationwide election that they are expected to organise is the election of the Local Council leaders. As of April 2018, those were being delayed by lack of sufficient funds.

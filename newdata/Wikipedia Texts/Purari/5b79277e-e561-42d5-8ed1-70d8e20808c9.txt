Purari language

Purari (Namau) is a Papuan language of Papua New Guinea.
Noting that the few similarities with the Eleman languages may be because of loanwords, Pawley and Hammarström (2018) leave it as unclassified rather than as part of Trans-New Guinea.Pronouns are 1sg nai, 2sg ni, 1pl enei.  The first may resemble Trans–New Guinea *na, but Purari appears to be related to the Binanderean–Goilalan languages.


== Name ==
Purari is also known as Koriki, Evorra, I'ai, Maipua, and Namau.  "Namau" is a colonial term which means "deaf (lit.), inattentive, or stupid (Williams 1924: 4)."  Today people of the Purari Delta find this term offensive.  F.E. Williams   reports that the "[a]n interpreter suggests that by some misunderstanding the name had its origin in the despair of an early missionary, who, finding the natives turned a deaf ear to his teaching, dubbed them all 'Namau'." (Williams 1924: 4).  Koriki, I'ai, and Maipua refer to self-defining groups that make up the six groups that today compose the people who speak Purari.  Along with the Baroi (formerly known as the Evorra, which was the name of a village site), Kaimari and the Vaimuru, these groups speak mutually intelligible dialects of Purari.

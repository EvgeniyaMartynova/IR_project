== History ==
Before the arrival of the Spaniards the region was already populated by Nahua people.
After the Spanish invasion. by March 1525 the peninsular had submitted to the province of Xalisco. 
When the Spanish troops went down to the sea, a large aboriginal army arrived. 
They were armed with bows, clubs, throwing darts, and each one wore a banderilla with multicolored feathers in his hand and on his face.
They were so numerous that Captain Francisco Cortés de San Buenaventura was afraid.
He proposed to avoid fighting, since he calculated that each Spaniard would have to confront a thousand Aborigines, but one of his captains, Angel de Villafana, persuaded him to fight, under four royal banners and others of crimson and apricot On one side the cross and on the other the image of the Purísima.
The struggle was about to begin, but when the banners were uncovered the virgin appeared bright and glittering.
The Indians were amazed by that portent.
Instead of attacking they gathered together, dragged their flags and placed them at the foot of the holy and old priest Juan de Villa Diego, bearer of the banner, and surrendered their arms before Cortes, declared themselves his vassals and celebrated with songs, dances and the sound of boleros and atabales.
In memory of this event the place is called the "Valle de Banderas".
In November 1847 the indigenous people raised a large army when they heard news of the American invasion. 
With the rallying cry of "Long live the Virgin of Guadalajara!" they rebelled against the government. 
In this place, Rojas raised an army of 2000 indigenous people who fought against the conservative chief Francisco Tovar. 
In 1872, Porfirio Díaz took refuge in these lands.
From 1825 to 1890 the region belonged to the 6th canton of Autlan, later to the 10th canton of Mascot. The 1 of April 1944 by decree number 4955 it was elevated to category of municipality with the name it takes today. Before that it was called El Tuito (Jalisco) and in 1843 was called San Pedro El Tuito (Jalisco).

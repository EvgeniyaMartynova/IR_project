Cabo Corrientes is at the southern end of the Gulf of Tribugá.
The cape is about 100 kilometres (62 mi) north of the Quebrada de Togoromá.
The coast to the south has a chain of low barrier islands, less than 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) high, behind which there are lagoons, mangrove swamps and a narrow belt of freshwater swamps.

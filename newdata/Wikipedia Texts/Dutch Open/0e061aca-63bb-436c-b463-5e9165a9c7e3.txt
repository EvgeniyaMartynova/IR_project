KLM Open

The KLM Open is an annual golf tournament played in the Netherlands, and has been part of the European Tour's schedule since the Tour was inaugurated in 1972. Founded in 1912, the tournament was originally known as the Dutch Open, before a variety of sponsors resulted in numerous name changes over the years, with KLM being the incumbent. The tournament has been moved around the golfing calendar, but since 2010 it has been held in early September.

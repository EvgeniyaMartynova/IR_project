Crateuas of Macedon

Crateuas (Greek: Κρατεύας Kratevas), also called Craterus (Κρατερός Krateros), was King of Macedon for four days in 399 BC. He was lover of Archelaus I of Macedon, whom he killed to become a king himself. According to another version, Crateuas killed the king because Archelaus had promised to give him one of his daughters in marriage, but later gave her to someone else. A third version asserts that Archelaus was unintentionally struck by Crateuas during a hunt. Crateuas was succeeded by Orestes and Aeropus II.

Silent Knight (album)

Silent Knight is the third studio album by the Canadian progressive rock band Saga and was originally released in August 1980.


== The Chapters ==
Two of the songs, "Don't Be Late (Chapter Two)" and "Too Much to Lose (Chapter Seven)" were part of a series of eight (but later sixteen) songs that Saga included within their first four albums called "The Chapters" which told the story of a young Albert Einstein. These songs were later included on The Chapters Live (rec. 2003, rel. 2005). To date, there's been no official compilation of the chapters in their studio incarnation. Silent Knight is certified Gold in Canada (50 000), having reached #42 in the charts. The Einstein Tower in Potsdam, Germany was used as a template for the album cover.

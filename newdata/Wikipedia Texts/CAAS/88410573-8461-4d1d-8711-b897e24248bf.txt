The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Abbreviation: CAAS; Chinese: 新加坡民航局, Pinyin: Xīnjīapō Mínghángjú; Malay: Penguasa Penerbangan Awam Singapura) is Singapore's national aviation authority and a statutory board under the Ministry of Transport of the Government of Singapore. Its head office is located on the fourth storey of Singapore Changi Airport's Terminal 2.


== Overview ==
Established on 1 September 1984, the CAAS regulates civilian air traffic within the airspace jurisdiction of the Republic. It also helps to enable the growth of the air hub and aviation industry in Singapore, promote safe industry practices and engages in civilian air-service agreements with air-service operators.
CAAS also operates the Air Traffic Control Tower, providing air navigation services to ensure faultless movements of civilian aircraft at Singapore’s airports and in the Singapore flight information region (FIR).
The CAAS also issues revenue stamps to pay for the passenger service charge on flights.
In July 2017, CAAS and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) entered into a working arrangement to recognize each other's certifications. CAAS is led by Director-General Mr Kevin Shum, with Mr Edmond Cheng serving as the board's Chairman.

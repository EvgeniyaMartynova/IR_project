Turtle Mountain (electoral district)

Turtle Mountain was a provincial electoral district in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created with the westward expansion of the province's boundaries in 1881, eliminated by redistribution in 1968, and re-established in 1979, formally returned to the electoral map with the provincial election of 1981, was dissolved for the 2011 election and will return once again for the 2019 Manitoba general election.
Turtle Mountain was located in the southwestern region of the province. It was bounded to the north by Ste. Rose, to the west by Minnedosa and Arthur-Virden, to the east by Pembina, Carman and Portage la Prairie, and south to the American state of North Dakota.
The riding was primarily rural. Communities in the riding included Killarney, Carberry, Glenboro, Pilot Mound and MacGregor.

Turtle Mountain was represented by the Progressive Conservative Party for most of its history, and was considered safe for that party. It was in Tory hands for all but six years after 1922 in its first incarnation, and was held by the Tories at all times in its second incarnation.  The last MLA was Cliff Cullen, who was elected in a 2004 by-election.

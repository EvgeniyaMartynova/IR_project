== Plot summary ==
Sixteen-year-old Jake Livingston (Christopher Collet) has been the man of the Livingston home since his parents divorced 2 years earlier, that is, until his mother (Teri Garr) started seeing Sam. Sam (Peter Weller), an alcoholic and drug addict, introduces Jake's mother to a self-destructive lifestyle.
His mom, Wendy, can't see beyond Sam's charms or her own emotional needs, while his younger brother, Brian (Corey Haim), succumbs to Sam's ingratiating manner. Jake resents Sam's constant presence in the household, however, particularly when Sam begins to establish rules and discipline for the boys and expects them to obey.
Jake becomes aware of a drug deal that Sam is engaged in, steals the drugs, and hides them. Sam verbally, then violently begins demanding that they be returned, whereupon Wendy finally realizes what kind of man she has brought into her sons' lives. After beating Jake and threatening to harm Wendy, Jake finally shows Sam where he hid the drugs. Having enough, Wendy demands that Sam leave, which results in Sam beating her. Defending his mother, Jake beats Sam and demands that he leave, threatening to kill him if he ever comes back. Sam then leaves as the family holds each other.

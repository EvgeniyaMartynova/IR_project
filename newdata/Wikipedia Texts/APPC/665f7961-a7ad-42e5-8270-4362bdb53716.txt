The Annenberg Center conducts research, convenes panels of experts, hosts lectures and conferences, and publishes reports on five main areas: Political communication, information and society, media and children, health communication, and adolescent risk. 
The APPC was established in 1993 by the ambassadors Walter and Leonore Annenberg and its ongoing funding comes from an endowment established for it at that time by the Annenberg Foundation. It currently has a staff of 54 people. Architect Fumihiko Maki has designed the Center's facilities.

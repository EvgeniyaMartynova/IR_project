=== Second World War ===
During the Battle of Sept-Îles, Rocket encountered German torpedo boats in the English Channel in October 1943, an action in which the cruiser Charybdis and destroyer Limbourne were lost. The latter was sunk by Rocket after she became disabled, to avoid her falling into enemy hands.  On 29 November 1943 HMS Rocket and HMS Tumult, sank U-86 east of the Azores, in position 40°52'N, 18°54'W, by depth charges.  Arriving in the Indian Ocean in January 1944, Rocket participated in the shelling of Sabang (25 July 1944) and of the Andaman Islands (February and March 1945).

In 1946 Rocket was at Chatham and between 1946 and 1948 she was used as an air target ship at Rosyth. In 1949 she was placed into reserve at Portsmouth. Between July 1949 and 1951 she was converted at Devonport Dockyard into a Type 15 fast anti-submarine frigate, with the new pennant number F193.
On 18 May 1951 she was re-commissioned for the 3rd Training Squadron, based in Derry. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1954 she returned to reserve at Rosyth, before being re-commissioned the following year.  In November 1956 she returned to reserve at Chatham, then transferred to the reserve at Portsmouth the following year.

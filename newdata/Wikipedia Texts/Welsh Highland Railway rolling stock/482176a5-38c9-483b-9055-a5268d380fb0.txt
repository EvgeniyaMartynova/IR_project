== Ffestiniog Railway locomotives used on the WHR ==

The following locomotives are normally Ffestiniog Railway stock that have run on the WHR.  Some have transferred for regular service, to cover for maintenance and traction requirements before there were enough dedicated WHR locomotives to operate the passenger service, others were for construction purposes only.  With the FR-WHR link now open, FR locos visit fairly regularly on special services.

Robert Hatton (Royalist)

Sir Robert Hatton (died 10 January 1653) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1642. He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War.
Hatton was the son of John Hatton of Long Stanton and his wife Joan Shute, daughter of Robert Shute (a baron of the Exchequer). He was admitted at Gray's Inn as of Clynton Cambridgeshire on 2 February 1602. He inherited the estates of Oakington, Cambridgeshire from his mother and probably lived there from about 1610. He was knighted at Whitehall on 12 March 1617. He also possessed the property of Oswalds in Bishopsbourne.In 1621, Hatton was elected Member of Parliament for Sandwich, but his election was declared void as the mayor had effectively disenfranchised part of the electorate. He was elected as MP for Sandwich in 1624 and 1625.In 1641 Hatton was elected MP for Castle Rising in a by-election for the Long Parliament.  On the outbreak of the Civil War he supported the King and was disabled from sitting in parliament on 7 September 1642 for executing a Commission of Array. He was appointed a Chamberlain of the Exchequer in 1644 but fled overseas after 1646 to escape his creditors. His estate at Oakington was under sequestration for ten years, and apparently not compounded for.  On 1 July 1651 parliament directed for his estates to be sold.Hatton died in 1653. Hatton's daughter Elizabeth married Sir Anthony Aucher, 1st Baronet who recovered Hatton's estates.

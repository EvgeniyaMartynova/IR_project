University of Colombo School of Computing

The University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) is a higher educational institute affiliated to the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka providing Computer Science and Information and Communication Technology education. The UCSC was formed on 1 September 2002 by bringing together the Department of Computer Science of the Faculty of Science of the University of Colombo and the Institute of Computer Technology and considered as the leading computing higher educational institution in Sri Lanka.


== History ==
Teaching of computing at the University of Colombo first started in 1967 with the setting up of the Statistical Unit as a separate unit of the Department of Mathematics of the Faculty of Science. Later with the initial guidance of Professor V. K. Samaranayake, the Statistical Unit was enhanced as the Statistical Consultancy and Data Processing Service Center. Starting with this center, in 1985 Samaranayake convinced the university to set up the Department of Statistics and Computer Science (DSCS). This is considered as the starting point of the UCSC. A batch of 50 students were taken to study computer science, through the University Grants Commission in 1997. In 2001, the DSCS separated into the Department of Computer Science (DCS) and the Department of Statistics (DS). Finally, UCSC was formed in 2002 by the merger of the existing Department of Computer Science of Faculty of Science and the Institute of Computer Technology (ICT) both of the University of Colombo.
Samaranayake became the founding director of the UCSC. After his retirement, he worked in UCSC as an acting director for a short period. In 2004 Dr. Ruvan Weerasinghe became the director of the UCSC and served for next six years. Then Prof. Gihan Wikramanayake became the director of the UCSC in 2010.

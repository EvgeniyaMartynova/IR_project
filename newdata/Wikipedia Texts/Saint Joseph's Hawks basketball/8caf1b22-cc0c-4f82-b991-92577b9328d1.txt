== History ==
Men's basketball is the most popular sport at Saint Joseph's University. The Hawks have competed in twenty-one NCAA Tournaments and sixteen NIT Tournaments. Throughout the school's history, 29 different players have been drafted into the NBA. The Hawks have been ranked 77 times in their history, 51 of which have been in the top 10.The Hawks appeared in 11 NCAA Tournaments between 1959 and 1974. The Hawks were coached by Hall of Fame coach "Dr. Jack" Ramsay from 1955 to 1966. Ramsay compiled a 234–72 record in his 11 years at Saint Joseph's. They reached Final Four in 1961 (although their 1961 3rd-place finish was later revoked by the NCAA,). Ramsay went on to coach several NBA teams and won the 1977 NBA Championship.
Jack McKinney took over after Ramsay left and led the Hawks to four more NCAA Tournaments between 1969 and 1974.
Following the 1974 season, the Hawks, with 11 fellow larger schools from the Middle Atlantic Conference, formed the new East Coast Conference.
In 1980–81, the Hawks, led by coach Jim Lynam, finished in second place in ECC play and won the ECC Tournament to receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament. As a #9 seed, the Hawks defeated Creighton in the First Round and upset #1 seeded and #1 ranked DePaul to reach the Sweet Sixteen. The Hawks defeated Boston College to advance to the Elite Eight before losing to eventual National Champion, Indiana. Lynam also left the Hawks to enjoy a long career as a coach and executive in the NBA.
Saint Joseph's joined the Atlantic 10 Conference prior to the 1982–83 season.
The Hawk's basketball program has also produced several NBA coaches. The first St. Joe player to become a pro coach was George Senesky, who led the Philadelphia Warriors from 1955 - 1958. When Dr. Jack Ramsey left Hawk Hill in 1968 he became the head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers. Dr. Ramsey then coached the Buffalo Braves from 1972 - 76 then moved to the Portland Trailblazers where he won the NBA Championship in 1977 upsetting the favorite 76ers who featured Dr. "J" Julius Erving and George McGinnis. From Portland he moved on to coach the Indiana Pacers 1986 to 1988 when he retired.
Another noted St. Joseph alum who coached for many years in the NBA was Jack McKinney. Coach McKinney, who followed Dr. Ramsey as the Hawk's head coach, left St. Joesph's to become an assistant head coach for the Milwaukee Bucks for two years before joining Dr. Ramsey at Portland. In 1979, coach McKinney was selected as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. His tenure in LA lasted only 14 games when he suffered major injuries in a bicycle accident. Assistant Head Coach and another St. Joe alum Paul Westhead took over for the injured McKinney and led LA to the NBA Championship. He stayed with the Lakers for three years and left to coach the Chicago Bulls and then the Denver Nuggets. He left Denver and became an assistant coach for three other NBA teams retiring in 2009. Following recovery from his injuries and with the success of Coach Westhead with the Lakers, McKinney took the head coaching job at the Indiana Pacers. After four successful years with Indiana, Coach McKinney ended his career in a nine game stint with the Kansas City Kings.
Hawk basketball standout Jim Lynam started his NBA coaching career in 1981 as an assistant in Portland. Two years later he got his first head coaching job with the San Diego/LA Clippers. After two years in the West Coach Lynam came back home to Philadelphia to be an assistant with 76ers and in 1987 he was named the team's head coach. He remained in that position for five years before leaving to coach the Washington Bullets. In 1987 he left head coaching to become an assistant for three NBA teams before retiring in 2010.
Jim O'Brien began his NBA coaching career in 1987 as an assistant with the New York Knicks and then two years later the Boston Celtics. In 2001, he was named the Celtics head coach and stayed through part of the 2004 season. A year later he was at the helm of the 76ers then left for a four year stint with the Pacers. He finished his coaching career as an assistant for three teams retiring in 2017.
Matty Guokas, a successful NBA player in his own right, became an assistant coach of the 76ers in 1983. He went on to coach Philadelphia from 1985 to 1988. He then left the Sixers and took the head coaching position with the Orlando Magic and retired after four seasons.

The Hawks were led by a backcourt of Jameer Nelson and Delonte West, both of whom were drafted in the 1st round of the 2004 NBA draft. The Hawks advanced to the Elite Eight with wins over Liberty, Texas Tech, and #17 Wake Forest. In the Elite Eight, they lost to Oklahoma State 64–62.

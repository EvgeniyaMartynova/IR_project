== Career ==
Smith became associated with his father in his law practice and railroad management.  After his father's death in 1858, he succeeded to the position of trustee under the lease of the Vermont and Canada Railroad.  Simultaneously he entered politics, and for many years the career in each line was involved with the other.  He was also one of the originators of the Northern Pacific Railway enterprise and was the president of the corporation from 1866 to 1872.  Under his lead five hundred and fifty-five miles of the road were built.

His efforts in office were centered on the American Civil War, including obtaining medical care for Vermont soldiers at the front, and securing the right of soldiers in the field to vote by absentee ballot.His home was a target of the Confederate St. Albans Raid.  He was not at home, but his wife was, and her appearance at the front door carrying an unloaded pistol (the only weapon she could find) was enough to cause the raiders to decide to bypass the Smith home while fleeing to Canada.Following his governorship Smith returned to his business interests, including serving as president of the Northern Pacific Railroad from 1866 to 1872.  He was chairman of the state delegation to the Republican National Conventions in 1872, 1880, and 1884.  After his retirement as governor he held no public office.

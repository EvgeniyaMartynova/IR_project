Cardiff City Ladies F.C.

Cardiff City Ladies Football Club is a Welsh women's football club playing in the FA Women's National League South. The club was founded in 1975 as Llanedeyrn L.F.C. after a local charity match. They play at Cardiff International Sports Stadium, Cardiff.


== History ==
The club has gone through diverse name changes. In 1981 the name was changed to Cardiff L.F.C., and in 1993 the club linked up with Inter Cardiff F.C. From this period the club has as ground the Cardiff Athletic Stadium, which still is used as the home ground today. In 1997 the connection with Inter Cardiff was broken. The club now changed its name to Cardiff County L.F.C and was affiliated to the Cardiff County Council. In 2001 the club got affiliated with Cardiff City, the professional men’s club from the same city.
At the beginning of the 2003 season, however, the club severed its connection with its male counterpart when its members voted against the men’s club proposals for the running of Cardiff City LFC, and became a totally independent outfit again. Although they were allowed to keep use of the Cardiff City name and kit colours, their crest is very different, and no longer uses the famous moniker 'Bluebirds' (although they are still referred to as such by media such as BBC Sport), incorporating the Welsh red dragon instead.
In 2006 Cardiff City Ladies won the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division and were promoted to the National Division for the first time. It is not the first Welsh club to make it to the highest division, however; Barry Town, which is now defunct, had a top-division stint in 2001. Relegated in the 2007–08 season, the club again were promoted to the National Division in 2010–11.Because Cardiff City Ladies has won the Welsh Women's Cup, the club has represented Wales played in the UEFA Women's Cup.

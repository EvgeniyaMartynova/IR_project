Hendersonville High School (Tennessee)

Hendersonville High School is one of three public high schools located in Hendersonville, Sumner County, Tennessee. The principal is Bob Cotter, a former principal for the alternative school R.T. Fisher.  Two middle schools feed into Hendersonville High: Ellis Middle School and Hawkins Middle School.
The school's colors have been black and gold ever since the first Commando football team in 1941, when the Vanderbilt University football  program provided the first Commando football team with older, used jerseys. The black and gold colors have remained ever since.  Hendersonville is known as the Commandos because 54 men were sent to fight in World War II. When they came back as veteran commandos the name stuck with the school and became the official mascot.

The school has rivalries with  Gallatin High School, Beech High School and Station Camp High School.

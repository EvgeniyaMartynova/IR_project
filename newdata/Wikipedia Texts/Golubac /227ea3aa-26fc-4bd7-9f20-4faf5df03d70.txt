== Name ==

In Serbian, the town is known as Golubac (Голубац), derived from golub ("pigeon" or "dove") and is therefore often translated as "the town of doves." Other names: Romanian: Golubăţ (also known as Golumbacu Mare or Columbacu), Hungarian: Galambóc, German: Taubenberg and Turkish: Güvercinlik meaning "dovecote."  
Historically, it was known as Columbria in Latin, a contraction of (castrum) Columbaria meaning "city of pigeons" (Latin: Columba, Greek: kòlymbos), and as a city derived from Cuppae during pre-Roman times.


== History ==
It was a stronghold called Cuppae during Roman and Early Byzantine times (1-6th century) and turned into a city (Columbria) in 554/5 AD.Archeological sites include the remnants of one of Roman Emperor Trajan's tables near Trajan's Bridge, found along his road through the Danube's Iron Gates; and the Roman fortress Diana. Golubac fortress, 4 km downstream, is from the 14th century and also of interest. The fortress was the scene of a battle against the Turks in 1428, where the Polish knight Zawisza Czarny was captured and executed by the Turks.
Charles I of Hungary conquered the castle in 1334. In 1387 Lazar of Serbia sieged it. Becoming a Hungarian ally in 1403–04, he received large possessions, including the important Belgrade and Golubac Fortress. The Turkish occupied it for the first time in 1391, but after that, Péter Perényi recaptured it. King Sigismund of Hungary acquired Golubac by a contract in 1427, but its Serbian captain sold it to the Turks for twelve thousand golds. Sigismund sieged the fortress in spring 1428 in response, but the mission was a failure, the King himself was almost killed by the Turks. In 1428, Matthias Corvinus tried to recapture it, but the siege was interrupted by Hungarian internal conflicts.
From 1929 to 1941, Golubac was part of the Morava Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

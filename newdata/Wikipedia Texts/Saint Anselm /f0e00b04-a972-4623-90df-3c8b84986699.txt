== History ==
The University was restored in its present form by Pope Leo XIII in 1887, created in honour of St. Anselm of Canterbury.
In 1952, the institution was given further recognition and flourished after the Second Vatican Council.


== Activities ==
Sant'Anselmo receives students from Benedictine congregations from around the world to "provide theological training to Benedictines and other congregations of the Church Universal".The Institute was canonically established by the Apostolic See as a faculty of Sacred Liturgy of the Pontifical University of St. Anselm in order to promote liturgical science through research and teaching. As such it is empowered to grant, in the name of the Pope, the academic degrees of License (SL.L.) and Doctorate (SL.D.)
The university's library was established with gifts from various Benedictine congregations and the personal collections of Cardinal Dusmet Gaetano Bernardino, and has since grown to become a substantial source of theological research material. As of 2015 the librarian was Dom Luigi Gioia, O.S.B.

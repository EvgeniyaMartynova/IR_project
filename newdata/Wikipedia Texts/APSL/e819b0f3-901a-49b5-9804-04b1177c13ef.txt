American Premier Soccer League

The American Premier Soccer League (APSL) soccer league is sanctioned by the United States Adult Soccer Association (USASA), and qualifies for the U.S. Open Cup through USASA channels.


== Competition format ==
The official regular season runs from January through September. For the playoffs, the four top seeded teams face each other in the semifinal and championship matches. The APSL also organizes a Fall Season that runs from September to December.


== Organization ==
The APSL is organized in a mostly decentralized structure and is managed as a team-run league. Each year the member clubs help elect a Commissioner, Treasurer and Secretary. Each team is individually owned and operated, and is responsible for maintaining league minimum standards. New teams seeking membership into the APSL are subject to approval from an executive committee of existing team owners. Member clubs have the right to make localized decisions for their respective markets, conferences and regions based on what they believe is best for their particular region.

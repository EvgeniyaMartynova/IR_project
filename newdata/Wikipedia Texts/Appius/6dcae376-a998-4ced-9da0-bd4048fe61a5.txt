Appius Claudius Pulcher (praetor 88 BC)

Appius Claudius Pulcher (c. 139 BC – 76 BC) was a Roman noble, general and politician of the 1st century BC. There is uncertainty about who his father was. It was most probably the Appius Claudius Pulcher who was consul in 143 BC. He was a supporter of Lucius Cornelius Sulla and served as praetor in 88 BC. He was exiled in that year by Gaius Marius while Sulla was away in the east. He returned to Rome after Lucius Cornelius Cinna died in 84 BC, and served as consul in 79 BC and as governor of Roman Macedonia from 78 BC to 76 BC. He was the father of a number of renowned Romans, most notable: the infamous Clodius and Clodia.

Carbon County was part of Emery County which was founded in 1880. The demographics along the Price River changed with the construction of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad in 1883 and the development of coal mines, largely in upper Emery, to fuel the railroad. The Utah Territory Legislature was partitioned to split off the north part, and thus it established Carbon County effective March 8, 1894. It was named for the element Carbon, to emphasize the industrial nature of the area.Carbon County is the second largest natural gas producer in Utah (after Uintah County), with 94 billion cubic feet produced in 2008.

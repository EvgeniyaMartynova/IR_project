In 1888, three sisters from the order of the Faithful Companions of Jesus began teaching 23 Catholic students in the very first Catholic school in Edmonton. In August 1888, Edmonton Catholic parents applied to organize a separate school district for their children. In October of that same year three sisters from the Faithful Companions of Jesus sailed from France to open a convent and a school in Edmonton. They began teaching at the newly formed St. Joachim Catholic School on 2 November 1888. That first year the sisters taught 23 students. At that time compulsory schooling began at age seven and was complete by the age of 12. From then they have grown from one school with 23 students to 100 schools with more than 42,000 students.

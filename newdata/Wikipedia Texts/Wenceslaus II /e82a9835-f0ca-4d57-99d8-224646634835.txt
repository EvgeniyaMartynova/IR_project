== Life ==
After his father's death in 1468, Wenceslaus II and his older brother Casimir II took the full government over the Duchy, because their younger brothers Jan V and Władysław are still minors. However, the main tasks of government were held by Casimir II.
Little is known about Wenceslaus II's life. He appears in the official documents for the first time around 1469. In 1474 was made the formal division of the Duchy of Zator in two parts: Wenceslaus II and Casimir II received the eastern part of the Skawa River.
Wenceslaus II died unmarried and childless between 1484–1487. It's unknown where he was buried.

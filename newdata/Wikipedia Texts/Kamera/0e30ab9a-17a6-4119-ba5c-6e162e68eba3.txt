== History ==
The award was first presented in 1966 as a strictly German television award. Since 1987, it has also been awarded to international stars. In 1995, the categories expanded to pop groups and to more public interests. In 2019 a 'Climate Action Award' was given to Greta Thunberg.In September 2019, Funke Mediengruppe announced the end of the traditional award for 2020. Due to a change in media consumption preferences of their audience in the course of digitization, the manager of Funke's magazine division said that the group would instead focus on digital content like the "YouTube Goldene Kamera Digital Award". The final 'Goldene Kamera' so far will be awarded on 21 March 2020 with Thomas Gottschalk as presenter.

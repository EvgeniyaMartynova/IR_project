Street's Disciple

Street's Disciple is the seventh studio album by American rapper Nas, released as a double album on November 30, 2004 by Columbia Records. Named after one of his lyrics from "Live at the Barbeque" by Main Source, the album's cover art was digitally created using photos of Nas to create an adaptation of The Last Supper.
Street's Disciple was well-received by critics and debuted at number 5 on the US Billboard 200, selling over 232,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was Nas's seventh consecutive platinum record in the United States, having shipped over 1 million copies.


== Production ==
Most of the album's production was handled between Salaam Remi, L.E.S. and Chucky Thompson of Sean Combs' production team The Hitmen. Remi contributed production on eleven tracks, L.E.S. produced on eight and Chucky Thompson helped on six. Salaam Remi (who collaborated with Nas on his previous LPs Stillmatic and God's Son) led all with nine solo productions. L.E.S. only produced three solo outings, but one included the single "Just a Moment". Thompson, on the other hand, had one solo production credit ("Getting Married").
Other notable producers from the album include A Tribe Called Quest member Q-Tip (who had last worked with Nas on Illmatic's "One Love" and the remix of "The World Is Yours") and D.I.T.C. producer Buckwild ("These Are Our Heroes"). Nas himself produced "Suicide Bounce" and "U.B.R. (Unauthorized Biography of Rakim)", both from the second disc. L.E.S. also brought on baggage for his productions. T. Black and Nut assisted the legendary producer on "The Makings of a Perfect Bitch" and Herb Middleton helped with the beat on "Me &You (Dedicated to Destiny)". Chucky Thompson, too, brought in extra help for "Live Now" (Barnardo "Nardo" Williams). Rapper Ill Bill made a song similar to "U.B.R. (Unauthorized Biography Of Rakim)" titled "U.B.S. (Unauthorized Biography Of Slayer)" on his album The Hour of Reprisal (2008).


== Music ==
Nas' father Olu Dara is featured on the title track "Street's Disciple" and lead single "Bridging the Gap". Aside from Ludacris  ("Virgo") and Quan ("Just a Moment") no other MC's actually deliver a verse on Street's Disciple. Busta Rhymes plays hypeman to "Suicide Bounce" and Doug E. Fresh beatboxes on "Virgo". Kelis (Nas' ex-wife) helps sing the chorus along with the bridge on "American Way". The album does feature many singers though, including: Amerie ("Rest of My Life"), Emily ("Reason"), Maxwell ("No One Else in the Room") and Keon Bryce ("War").  Nas also uses a voice synthesizer to make his voice high-pitched for his female alter-ego Scarlett, who appears on "Sekou Story" and "Live Now".
Street's Disciple features multiple socio-conscious and political songs, such as "A Message to the Feds, Sincerely, We the People", "American Way" and "These Are Our Heroes". The latter (originally titled "Coon's Picnic") contained attacks directed toward multiple black celebrities including: O.J. Simpson and NBA superstar Kobe Bryant. Another topic addressed by Nas were important women in his life or females in general. "Getting Married" is dedicated to his then-newlywed wife Kelis Rogers-Jones, "Me & You (Dedicated to Destiny)" is, aptly titled, directed toward Nas' daughter and "Makings of a Perfect Bitch" describes most men's idea of the ideal woman. Death and appreciating life are the subject to several songs as well such as "Live Now", "Rest of My Life" and "Just a Moment".


== Release and reception ==
Street's Disciple was released by Columbia Records on November 30, 2004, to widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on 16 reviews. Chicago Sun-Times writer Jeff Vrabel called it "sprawling and ambitious", while Robert Christgau from The Village Voice found its double-CD length "ambitious not hubristic, imposing not indigestible", and wrote that Nas "finally seems comfortable with his (black) humanity. He's responsible, thoughtful, and compassionate, never mealymouthed". He later named it the 11th best album of 2004 in his year-end list for the Pazz & Jop critics poll. Rolling Stone magazine's Jon Caramanica said it was "the rare instance of hip-hop old and wise enough to look backward without forgetting what it was like to look ahead with awe and wonder". Noah Callahan-Bever of Vibe was less enthusiastic, finding much of the songs "routine", suggesting Nas "needs new challenges, enlightening experiences, and careful insights to inspire him".In the first week of its release, the album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 and sold 232,000 copies in the United States. On November 18, 2005, it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having shipped one million copies. It was Nas's seventh consecutive platinum record in the US. "Bridging the Gap" was the album's only single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 94.

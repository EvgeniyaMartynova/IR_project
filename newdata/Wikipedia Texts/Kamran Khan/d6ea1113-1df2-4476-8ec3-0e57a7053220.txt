He played in the Indian Premier League for Rajasthan Royals and later Pune Warriors, and represented Uttar Pradesh and Colts at domestic level. Playing for RR along with KKR's Ajantha Mendis he bowled the first ever super over in the history of the IPL.

The son of a woodcutter, Khan has struggled with poverty. Telling of how he would travel to trials, he said "Be it Lucknow or Kanpur, I used to sleep at platforms. I used to buy a platform ticket and spend the night there ... I always had monetary problems. I never dared to ask money from my brothers. I had one pair of white clothes for trials". Shane Warne, the Rajasthan captain, described Khan as "a young kid, a left-armer, a slinger ... He's a tiny little guy but he bowls 140 km/h plus". The Pune Warriors India joined the IPL for its 2011 season and recruited Khan after two seasons with Rajasthan; however, he only played one match for Pune.Nearly two years after his last twenty20 match, Khan made his first-class debut for Colts Cricket Club in March 2013.

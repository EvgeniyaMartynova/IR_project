Amalberga of Maubeuge

Saint Amalberga of Maubeuge (also Amalburga, Amalia, or Amelia of Lobbes or Binche) was a Merovingian nun and saint who lived in the 7th century.  She is said to have been the sister or niece of Pippin of Landen and would have married Count Witger, Duke of Lorraine. In her biography she is presented as the mother of five saints: Emebert, Reineldis, Pharaildis, Ermelindis and Gudula.  Amalberga joined the monastic community at Maubeuge Abbey after the birth of her youngest daughter Gudula.
Her feast is celebrated on July 10. The translation of her relics from Lobbes to Binche (event of the 15th century) is celebrated on June 10.
Amalberga of Maubeuge is not to be confused with the virgin Amalberga of Temse (venerated in Ghent, Temse and Munsterbilzen) who died in 772, and whose feast day is July 10 or October 27.


== Hagiography ==
The biography of Amalberga of Maubeuge (s:la:Vita S. Amalbergae viduae) is probably written by Abbott Hugo of Lobbes (1033â€“1063) between 1033 and 1048. Apart from a few Merovingian details, her genealogy was copied from another 11th-century hagiography, namely the Martyr story of Catherine of Alexandria. The biographical profile of her legendary husband, duke Witger of Lotharingia, is inspired on an historical figure from the 10th century, Wigeric of Lotharingia.

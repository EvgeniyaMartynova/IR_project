== History ==
Buerton appears in the Domesday survey as Burtune; it was then held by William Malbank, who held much of the land in the Nantwich hundred, and had a hawk's eyrie. In 1804, it formed part of the estate of the Earl of Grosvenor. The village had a windmill in 1653; the surviving building just outside Buerton village dates from 1779 and was in use until 1880. A school was founded in Buerton village in 1871 by the British and Foreign School Society, and a Band of Hope lecture hall was built in 1885.


== Governance ==
Buerton is administered by the Buerton Parish Council. From 1974 the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the new unitary authority of Cheshire East. Buerton falls in the parliamentary constituency of Eddisbury, which has been represented by Antoinette Sandbach since 2015, after being represented by Stephen O'Brien (1999–2015).

The civil parish has a total area of 2,981 acres (1,206 ha). The terrain is gently undulating, with a high point of 145 metres at SJ706414 near the Shropshire border, south of College Fields.

Several small areas of woodland are located within the civil parish, including Brick-kiln Wood, Brook Plantation, Fox Covert, Long Wood and The Ox Leasow. Birchall Brook forms part of the north-eastern parish boundary; several unnamed brooks run through the parish and there are many scattered small meres and ponds.The A525 (Woore Road) runs east–west through the parish from Audlem to Woore in Shropshire. On or near the western boundary of the parish, Kettle Lane runs southwards from the A525 through Kinsey Heath, connecting with Paddock Lane and Bagley Lane within the parish of Audlem, while Longhill Lane runs northwards from the A525 through Moblake, Raven's Bank, Longhill and Woolfall towards Hankelow. Buerton village is centred on the junction of the A525 and Windmill Lane, which runs north-westwards to meet Longhill Lane at Longhill. Woodhouse Lane continues Kettle Lane, running broadly east–west through the south of the parish, becoming Bellaport Road in Shropshire. The National Cycle Network Regional Route 75 runs southwards from Audlem along the western parish boundary and then cuts broadly eastwards through the south of the parish, following Kettle and Woodhouse Lanes.

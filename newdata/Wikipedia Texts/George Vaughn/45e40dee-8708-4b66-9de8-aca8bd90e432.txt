=== Notes on Vaughn's victories ===
#1: Vaughn was about to score his first victory after a bright yellow Pfalz D III took a shot at him. He was shocked and outraged. Breaking formation, Vaughn made a climbing turn to the right pursuing the Pfalz, and closed the range as the enemy pilot headed east into Germany. His adversary dove as the range continued to close. Vaughn opened fire at 100 yards and expended 200 rounds of ammunition from his Vickers gun. The Pfalz began smoking, fell some 500 feet, and burst into flames. Vaughn would later comment: "I remember my first combat victory. The Pfalz I was engaged with got a long burst into my tail before I knew he was even in the sky. That was a great lesson never to be forgotten, always see the other fellow first and never let him see you first. Fortunately his aim was quite poor and after that it was only the routine we had learned in combat school. Eventually he turned for home. I chased him, which wasn't the right thing to do as it turned out. When I finally caught up with him I was quite far into German territory and my flight commander really told me off later, because he didn't relish being pulled that far into Germany just to watch over me. The Pfalz was confirmed by people in the squadron and on the ground. He fell in flames."

#11: Shared with Lt Howard Burdick "While on O.P., immediately after dropping bombs on Awoingt, saw 2 two-seaters, at 3,500 feet, at 9:10a, just E of Awoingt.  Fired at them and they dived east.  Lieut Burdick and I followed on D.F.W., with orange fuselage and camoouflaged wings, and shot him down attacking him first from the front.  I got in 150 rounds from 75 yards.  He went down in a half-dive, half-spin, and crashed into the ground at 57b.B.23."

=== Distinguished Service Cross ===
"The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to George Augustus Vaughn, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action near Cambrai, France, September 22, 1918. Lieutenant Vaughn while leading an offensive flight patrol sighted 18 enemy Fokkers about to attack a group of five allied planes flying at a low level. Although outnumbered nearly 5 to 1, he attacked the enemy group, personally shot down two enemy planes, the remaining three planes of his group shooting down two more. His courage and daring enabled the group of allied planes to escape. Again on September 28, 1918, he alone attacked an enemy advance plane which was supported by seven Fokkers and shot the advance plane down in flames."
DSC citation, General Orders No. 60, W.D., 1920


=== Distinguished Flying Cross ===
"For conspicuous bravery in attacking enemy aircraft. On 23 August 1918, while on offensive patrol, he attacked an enemy kite balloon near Ham. Closing to almost point blank range, he fired upon it so that it burst into flames and was destroyed. Shortly afterwards, he observed an enemy two-seater near Maricourt. He attacked it, shooting it down from a height of 500 feet so that it was completely crashed. On 22 August, he drove to its destruction, an enemy two-seater near Villers Carbonnel. In all, he has accounted for six enemy aircraft, five machines destroyed and one driven down completely out of control, and one kite balloon."

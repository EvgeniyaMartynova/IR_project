Vardar Macedonia (Macedonian and Serbian: Вардарска Македонија, Vardarska Makedonija) was  the name given to the territory of the Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia roughly corresponding to today's North Macedonia.

== Geography ==
It usually refers to the part of the region of Macedonia attributed to the Kingdom of Serbia by the Treaty of Bucharest (1913). The territory is named after the Vardar, the major river in the area. Officially, the area (including parts of today Kosovo and Eastern Serbia) was called Southern Serbia (Serbian: Jужна Србија, Južna Srbija), later Vardar Banovina, because the very name Macedonia was prohibited in Serbia, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.After World War I, the present-day Strumica and Novo Selo municipalities were broken away from Bulgaria and ceded to Yugoslavia. After World War II, most of the area became part of SFR Yugoslavia as SR Macedonia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, besides the Republic of North Macedonia, the region encompasses also Trgovište and Preševo municipalities in Serbia, as well the Elez Han municipality in Kosovo. Sometimes in the region are included the areas of Golo Brdo and Mala Prespa in Albania.

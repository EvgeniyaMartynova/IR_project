Their first release, in 1989, was the "Coming From The Mill" EP which became single of the week in the NME magazine, and featured the songs "Roses", "We've Got Time" and "Something On My Mind". The same publication tipped Milltown Brothers for stardom in the 1990s, along with The Hoovers, Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine, The Charlatans, The Mock Turtles and New Fast Automatic Daffodils.The band's second indie single was "Which Way Should I Jump", with "Silvertown" as the B-side. After the band signed to A&M Records worldwide in 1990, "Which Way Should I Jump?" was re-recorded and charted in the UK Singles Chart at number 38, and reached number 10 in the U.S. Billboard Modern Rock chart.
An album, called Slinky, followed. It peaked at number 27 in the UK Albums Chart. The next single released from the album was "Here I Stand", which was also used as the theme tune for the television programme, Preston Front. It peaked at number 41 in the UK Singles Chart.  They were supported on the tour to promote this album by the Beware the Green Monkey, fronted by Bruce Thomas with Paul Chapman on bass.

Kuhn's-Big K

Kuhn's-Big K, usually advertised as "Big K," was a large discount store chain in the Southeastern United States that merged with Walmart in 1981 (locations in Charleston, South Carolina and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina were known as "Big-K Edwards" after Big K purchased the locally owned Edwards chain). It once comprised 119 stores. The company maintained headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee. It is not related to Big Kmart.

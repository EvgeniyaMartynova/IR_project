Ulusal Birlik Partisi

The National Unity Party (Turkish: Ulusal Birlik Partisi, UBP) is a national-conservative political party in Northern Cyprus. It was founded by Rauf Denktaş on 11 October 1975. The party was in power from its creation until the 2003 elections with the exception of the period from 1994–1996.
In the 2009 legislative elections for the House of Representatives of Northern Cyprus the party won 44% of the popular vote and 26 out of 50 seats, forming a majority government. Its candidate, former Prime Minister Derviş Eroğlu amassed at the Northern Cyprus presidential elections (of 17 April 2005) 22.8% of the votes.
From 2016 until elections in early 2018, the party was the senior partner in a minority government with the Democratic Party, with its leader Hüseyin Özgürgün serving as Prime Minister. It had previously been a junior partner in a coalition with the Republican Turkish Party, preceded by a period as the opposition party between 2013 and 2015.

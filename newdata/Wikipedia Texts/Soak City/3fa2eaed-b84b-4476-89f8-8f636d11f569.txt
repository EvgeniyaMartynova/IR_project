Soak City (Kings Dominion)

Soak City is a water park owned by Cedar Fair, located at the back of Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia.  It is included with the admission to the park.


== History ==

When it debuted in 1992, it was originally named Hurricane Reef. In 1999, an expansion occurred to the water park and the attractions received new names and park was changed to WaterWorks. It has two sections, the Northside which was formerly known as Hurricane Reef, and Southside which is the newer section of WaterWorks. The water parks at Kings Island and Carowinds were also known as WaterWorks for a period of time before being renamed Boomerang Bay.
In 2015, Kings Dominion announced that WaterWorks would undergo a major expansion and be renamed Soak City, a name that has been used for other Cedar Fair water parks. The expansion included a new slide complex called Hurricane Heights featuring three unique slides, a new children's area called Splash Island, and the removal of the Shoot the Curl speed slides.
Tornado, a ProSlide Tornado slide, was removed at the start of the 2018 season.

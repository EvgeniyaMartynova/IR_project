== History ==
Soak City originally opened in 1989 as a 12-acre (4.9 ha) water park under the name WaterWorks featuring 15 water slides, a wave pool, and a lazy river ride called Action River.  WaterWorks was the first themed area to be added to Kings Island since 1976, bringing the total to seven.  The cost was roughly $4 million USD.The water park was expanded in 1997 to 30 acres (12 ha). It was renamed in 2004 to Crocodile Dundee's Boomerang Bay, and again in 2007 to Boomerang Bay dropping Crocodile Dundee from the name. On September 2, 2011, Kings Island announced that the water park would undergo a $10-million expansion, which would include the renovation of the water park's main entrance, a revamp of the existing Lazy River ride, and the construction of additional amenities. A second, larger wave pool was also added, and the water park's name was changed to Soak City for the 2012 season.

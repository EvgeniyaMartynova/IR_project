George A. J. Webb

George Alfred John Webb (1861 – 16 August 1949) was an English painter who had a considerable career in Australia painting portraits of South Australian and Victorian public figures. In correspondence, he signed his name "George A. J. Webb"; many of his paintings, but not all, were signed simply "WEBB".


== History ==
Webb studied painting in England and Europe before emigrating to Australia around 1890, but could have been as early as 1888. His older sister Frances "Fanny" Webb had married the painter Charles Rolando (1844-1893) around 1874, moving to Australia in 1885 and setting up a studio in Grey Street, East Melbourne.Webb lived and worked first in Melbourne, Victoria, painting landscapes around Fernshaw and Gippsland Lakes which Rolando also favoured and often took him there on excursions. Then 1890 and 1891 in Launceston, Tasmania, returned to Melbourne, where he married Christina Lake in 1892 and spent their honeymoon in Europe. When Rolando died in 1893 Webb took his place in Rolando's art classes for at least a year thereby collaborating with Jan Hendrik Scheltema.
In 1897 they moved to Adelaide, where he opened a studio in Broken Hill Chambers then in Brookman Building, where he also conducted classes. He moved to Steamship Building, Currie Street sometime before 1914. He joined the South Australian Society of Arts soon after his arrival, and proved to be an active member, participating in most exhibitions and was for some years its vice president.
Their holidays were often spent with her sister, Florence Lake (died 25 November 1946), at "Lyndoch" on the Hopkins River near Warrnambool.During the Great War, Mrs Webb was active with the Cheer-Up Society in its work providing comforts for the "diggers".In 1917 they moved from their home at 18 South Terrace, Adelaide, to Melbourne to be closer to his wife's parents, who were of advanced years. He opened a studio in Stalbridge Chambers, Chancery Lane and lived at "Lalla Rookh", 41 Fellows St, Kew.
In 1920 George Rolfe died, leaving a considerable sum (£23,000) in trust for Christina and her two children.Around 1925 he returned to Adelaide, where his daughter, Clarice Trott lived, and purchased a home at 3 Edwin Terrace, Gilberton. Christina died at Warrnambool in 1930 while staying with her sister. She had been in poor health for some time. Charles Webb appears to have done little in the way of painting from that time. He died in a nursing home in Adelaide on 16 August 1949. The newspapers made no mention of his passing, apart from a death notice, which made no mention of his family.

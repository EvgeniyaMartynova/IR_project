Adtranz C-100

The C-100 was an automated people mover rolling stock first developed by Westinghouse Transportation Systems, which later became AEG-Westinghouse, AEG Transportation, and eventually Adtranz. A pioneer in the development of automated guideway transit, it was succeeded by Bombardier Transportation's CX-100, which is found at many airports today. The newer CX-100 is capable of using most of the existing infrastructure of the C-100, making it easy to upgrade to the newer vehicles. Because of this, production of the C-100 ceased upon Bombardier's acquisition of Adtranz in 2000.
The C-100 first made its debut in 1971 with the opening of the first people mover system serving an airport, in Tampa, Florida. The fleet initially consisted of eight vehicles, however, as the airport expanded, the fleet was later increased in size.
A majority of the C-100 fleets were replaced by Mitsubishi's Crystal Movers. The Metromover, an urban downtown people mover in Miami, Florida, had used a fleet of 29 C-100s delivered in two batches: 12 in 1984 and another 17 in 1992; these were gradually replaced with CX-100s by 2014. The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Automated People Mover also formerly used a large fleet of C-100 vehicles until they were retired in 2002 and replaced by brand new CX-100 vehicles.
The CX-100 was later renamed the Bombardier Innovia APM 100 and has since been succeeded by the APM 200, which uses slightly different technology from the APM 100 and is not compatible with it. Nevertheless, the APM 100 continues to be produced by Bombardier for use on legacy systems based on the C-100 infrastructure.

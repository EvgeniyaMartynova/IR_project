FIFA World Cup Fair Play Trophy

At the end of each FIFA World Cup final tournament, several awards are presented to the players and teams which have distinguished themselves in various aspects of the game.


== Awards ==
There are currently five post-tournament awards, and one given during the tournament:
the Golden Ball (currently commercially termed "adidas Golden Ball") for best player, first awarded in 1982;
the Golden Boot (currently commercially termed "adidas Golden Boot", previously known as the "adidas Golden Shoe" from 1982 to 2006) for top goal scorer, first awarded in 1982;
the Golden Glove Award (currently commercially termed "adidas Golden Glove"; previously known as the "Lev Yashin Award" from 1994 to 2006) for best goalkeeper, first awarded in 1994;
the Best Young Player (currently commercially termed as "Hyundai Best Young Player") award for best player under 21 years of age at the start of the calendar year, first awarded in 2006;
the FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team that advanced to the second round with the best record of fair play, first awarded in 1970;
the Man of the Match Award (currently commercially termed as "Budweiser Man of the Match") for outstanding performance during each game of the tournament, first awarded in 2002.Two other awards were given between 1994 and 2006:
The Most Entertaining Team award for the team that has entertained the public the most, during the World Cup final tournament, as determined by a poll of the general public;
An All-Star Team comprising the best players of the tournament chosen  by the technical study group.


== Golden Ball ==

The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals, with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media. Those who finish as runners-up in the vote receive the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively. The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, sponsored by Adidas and France Football, though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as "golden ball winners" Kempes, Cruyff, Pelé, Bobby Charlton, Garrincha and Didi for 1978, 1974, 1970, 1966, 1962 and 1958 respectively. Barcelona is the only club whose players have won the Golden Ball a record 3 times (Johan Cruyff in 1974, Romário in 1994, Lionel Messi in 2014).


== Golden Boot ==

The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup. While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers, the first time an award was given was in 1982, under the name Golden Shoe. It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010. FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners.If there is more than one player with the same number of goals, since 1994 the tie-breaker goes to the player without a penalty goal, if none has a penalty then the tie breaker goes to the person with more assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such. If there is still more than one player, the tie-breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time, which translates to a higher goal average.


== Golden Glove ==

The Golden Glove Award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament. The award was introduced with the name Lev Yashin Award in 1994, in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper. The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player's performance throughout the final competition. Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position, they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well, as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002. In the event of a tie, the Golden Glove Award goes to the goalkeeper who progressed furthest in the competition. The next tiebreakers are saves made, then minutes played.

Although the Golden Glove Award was first awarded in 1994, every All-Star Team in World Cups prior to 1998 except 1990 included only one goalkeeper. 


== Best Young Player Award ==

The Best Young Player award was awarded for the first time at the 2006 World Cup in Germany and given to Germany's Lukas Podolski. The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old.  For the 2018 World Cup, this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1997. The election took place on FIFA's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group.FIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the "best young player" of the World Cup, between 1958 and 2002, named the best young player of each tournament. With 61% of the overall vote, the winner was Pelé, who finished ahead of the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas, the best young player at Mexico 1970, and England's Michael Owen, who reached similar heights at France 98.


== FIFA Fair Play Trophy ==

The FIFA Fair Play Trophy is given to the team with the best record of fair play during the World Cup final tournament since 1970. Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered. The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy, a diploma, a fair play medal for each player and official, and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development.The appearance of the award was originally a certificate. From 1982 to 1990, it had been a golden trophy based on Sport Billy, a football-playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play. Ever since 1994, it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure. Peru was the first nation to win the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico.


== Man of the Match ==
The Man of the Match award picks the outstanding player in every game of the tournament since 2002. While the inaugural two editions were chosen by the technical group, the Man of the Match is since 2010 picked by an online poll on FIFA's website.

== Most Entertaining Team ==
The FIFA Award for the Most Entertaining Team is a subjectively awarded prize for the team that had done the most to entertain the public with a positive approach to the game, organised through public participation in a poll starting in 1994.


== All-Star Team ==
The All-Star Team is a team of the best performers at the respective World Cup finals. The ways in which the FIFA All-Star team members have been chosen has varied from year to year.  A technical study group consisting of journalists - mostly from Europe and South America - and experts has historically chosen the team. However, in 1994 FIFA decided to add an official squad, chosen by the FIFA technical group and under the brand name MasterCard All-Star Team. For 1998, 2002 and 2006, substitute and reserve members were also nominated for full 22 and 23-player squads. The All-Star team wound up dropped prior to the 2010 tournament - coincidentally, three years after FIFA changed its sponsorship from MasterCard to Visa.
1 In addition to the 16 of the All-Star Team, 6 reserves were listed:  Edwin van der Sar,  Juan Sebastián Verón,  Thierry Henry,  Jay-Jay Okocha,  Michael Owen, and  Christian Vieri.2 Again there were seven reserves:  Iker Casillas,  Cafu,  Dietmar Hamann,  Joaquín,  Hidetoshi Nakata,  Landon Donovan, and  Marc Wilmots.In 2010, an equivalent of the All Star Team was an online poll to FIFA.com Club members named "Dream Team", sponsored by Yingli. The Dream Team poll returned the following edition sponsored by Oi, and again in 2018 sponsored by Hisense.
While FIFA did not release an official list for 2014, official sponsor Castrol published a team of the tournament based on their Castrol Performance Index, which evaluates players' performances through statistical data. Similarly, McDonald's sponsored in 2018 a fantasy football game, whose team of highest-scoring players was published after the tournament.
Only two players have been named in three separate All-Star teams whose selection only included the starting eleven: Djalma Santos in 1954, 1958 and 1962, Franz Beckenbauer in 1966, 1970 and 1974. Philipp Lahm also achieved it in 2006, 2010 and 2014. However, the 2006 edition listed 23 players and 2014 had two All-Star team listed. Lahm's name has only been in one of these.
21 players have been named in two separate All-Star teams: Luis Monti (1930 and 1934; representing Argentina and Italy respectively); Garrincha (1958 and 1962); Pelé (1958 and 1970); Bobby Charlton (1966 and 1970); Ruud Krol and Rob Rensenbrink (1974 and 1978); Berti Vogts (1974 and 1978); Paolo Rossi (1978 and 1982); Michel Platini (1982 and 1986); Diego Maradona (1986 and 1990); Paolo Maldini (1990 and 1994); Dunga (1994 and 1998); Roberto Carlos, Rivaldo, and Ronaldo (1998 and 2002); Lilian Thuram and Zinedine Zidane (1998 and 2006); Michael Ballack and Miroslav Klose (2002 and 2006); Marcelo and Thiago Silva (2014 and 2018).
Pelé hold the record of the longest time between being named in two separate All-Star teams by 12 years apart (1958 and 1970).
Uruguay in 1930 and 1950,  Spain in 2010 and Germany in 2014 are the only teams to have had a player in every position on the All-Star Team. Germany and Italy achieved it in 2006, however, the 2006 edition listed 23 players.
Uruguay in 1930 and Italy in 2006 have the most players selected in the All-Star Team with 7 players each. However, the 1930 selection only had 11 players overall, while the 2006 selection had 23.
37 different Brazilian players have been named in All-Star teams, Brazil is also the nation with most nominations with 44 nominees in every position except goalkeeper.
Only three players from North American zone and two from each the African and Asian zones have been named to All-Star teams, Bert Patenaude and Claudio Reyna from the United States in 1930 and 2002, as well as Luis Gabelo Conejo from Costa Rica in 1990, Hong Myung-bo and Yoo Sang-chul of South Korea in 2002 and Roger Milla from Cameroon in 1990 and El Hadji Diouf from Senegal in 2002. Another player from each zone has been named in reserves: Jay-Jay Okocha from Nigeria in 1998, Hidetoshi Nakata from Japan in 2002 and Landon Donovan from the United States in 2006.
Only one player on the victorious 1986 Argentina team, Diego Maradona, was selected in that year's All-Star team.
Uniquely, brothers Brian Laudrup and Michael Laudrup were both selected for the All Star Team from Denmark in 1998.
Similarly, Cesare Maldini and Paolo Maldini are the only father and son players that were both selected for the All Star Team from Italy, in 1962 and 1990, 1994 respectively.
Uniquely, Argentinian compatriots Diego Maradona (1979 and 1986) and Lionel Messi (2005 and 2014) are the only players that won the Golden Ball award at both FIFA World Cup and FIFA World Youth Championship.

== History ==
The club was established in 1936 and initially played in the East Kent Amateur League, before joining the Eastern Section of the Kent County League. They won Division One in 1969–70 and were Division One runners-up in 1976–77 before going on to win the Premier Division in 1978–79. The Premier Division was renamed the Senior Division in 1984. The town's main club, Folkestone, folded in 1990, and after a third-place finish in 1990–91, Invicta joined Division Two of the Kent League, which was largely composed of reserve teams. They went on to win the division, as well as the Division Two Cup and the Kent Intermediate Shield in the 1991–92 season, and were promoted to Division One.Folkestone were runners-up in Division One of the Kent League in 1997–98, earning promotion to the Southern Division of the Southern League. They were transferred to the Eastern Division for the 1999–2000 season. They went on to finish as runners-up in the division, earning promotion to the Premier Division. The club spent three seasons in the Premier Division, before finishing bottom of the table in 2002–03, after which they were relegated to the Eastern Division. A fifth-place finish the following season was enough for an immediate promotion due to the creation of the Conference North and South creating several spaces in the divisions above. However, the club were transferred to the Isthmian League, joining its Premier Division.In 2005–06 Folkestone reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 2–1 at League Two Chester City. The club spent four seasons in the Isthmian League Premier Division before relegation to Division One South at the end of the 2008–09 season. In 2009–10 they were runners-up in Division One South, having missed out on the title due to having ten points deducted for going into administration. However, they qualified for the promotion play-offs, and after beating Leatherhead on penalties in the semi-finals, they defeated Godalming Town 2–1 in the final, earning promotion back to the Premier Division. In the following season the club finished bottom of the Premier Division and the club were relegated straight back to Division One South.
The next four seasons saw Folkestone finish in the top five, qualifying for the promotion play-offs; in 2011–12 they lost 2–1 to Dulwich Hamlet in the semi-finals and in 2012–13 they lost at the same stage to Maidstone United. In 2013–14 they won their semi-final, beating Hastings United 3–2, but lost on penalties to Leatherhead in the final after a 1–1 draw. They reached the final again in 2014–15 after defeating Whyteleafe in the semi-finals, but were beaten 3–0 in the final by Merstham. After four successive play-off failures, the club won Division One South in 2015–16 to return to the Premier Division. They finished fourth in the Premier Division in 2017–18, going on to lose 4–0 in the play-off semi-finals to Hendon.

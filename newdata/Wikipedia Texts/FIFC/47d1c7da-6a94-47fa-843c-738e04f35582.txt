Following their second title they were promoted to the Eastern Counties League Division One. Despite finishing in third position, which would have earned them promotion to the Premier Division, the club were forced into resigning from the league at the end of their first season in the ECL as their ground did not meet the league's requirements and planning permission for improvements had not been approved.
As a result they dropped into the Senior A Division of the Cambridgeshire League. At the end of the 2007–08 season they were promoted back to the Premier Division after finishing as runners-up, earning promotion to the Premier Division. The following season they won the Premier Division, as well as the Premier Cup and Cambridgeshire Challenge Cup. In 2009–10 they won the Premier Division for the second consecutive season.

Vist Station

Vist is a defunct railway station located on the Nordland Line located in the village of Vist in Steinkjer municipality, Trøndelag county, Norway. The station building was razed in 1965 and the station closed for traffic in 1990. The station did not have a residential section and was drawn by Paul Armin Due.


== History ==
The station was built as part of Hell–Sunnan Line and opened 15 November 1905 along with the rest of the line north of Verdal. Though part of the initial plans for the railway, and supported by the then Sparbu municipal council, the Parliament decided not to build the station on 5 June 1900 but changed their minds giving the go-ahead on 24 April 1901.

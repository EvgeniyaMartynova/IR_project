St. Croix Island (Algoa Bay)

St. Croix Island at 33°47′58″S 25°46′11″E is 3.9 km (2.4 mi) from the nearest land and rises to 59 m (194 ft). The BirdLife fact sheet states the 12 ha (30 acres) island is only 58 m (190 ft) above sea level. It adds that the island is rocky and “supports minimal vegetation”. The island runs 700 m (2,300 ft) along a northwest, southeast axis and is about 360 m (1,180 ft) wide at its broadest – along the west coast. Its highest point is halfway along the north coast. Bartholomeu Dias planted a padrão and celebrated Mass on the island in March 1488. With 22,000 African penguins breeding on the island it is the largest breeding colony of this penguin species on the planet. Boat trips out of Port Elizabeth can take guests to see these birds.
Brenton Island (33°49′3″S 25°45′54″E) is equally sparsely vegetated and is less than 20 m (66 ft) in elevation, and is roughly 250 m × 200 m (820 ft × 660 ft) in size with a northwest-southeast orientation. It is 5.75 km (3.57 mi) to sea from the nearest point on the mainland and 1.75 km (1.09 mi) south of St. Croix. Named after Naval Commissioner Sir Jahleel Brenton
Jahleel, at less than 10 m (33 ft) in height, is just over 1 km (0.62 mi) from the closest beach and less than that from the Port of Ngqura’s 2.6 km (1.6 mi) long eastern breakwater. Jahleel is about the same size as Brenton and has a north-south axis. It is 5.75 km (3.57 mi) west of St. Croix, and is named after Sir Jahleel Brenton.

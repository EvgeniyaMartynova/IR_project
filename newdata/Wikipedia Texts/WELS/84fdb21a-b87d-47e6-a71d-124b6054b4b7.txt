WELS rating

Water Efficiency Labelling and Standard (WELS) is a labeling scheme initiated by the Australian Government to help Australian households conserve water and money. On 1 July 2006, it became mandatory across Australia to carry a (WELS) Water Rating label when selling showers, washing machines, dishwashers, toilet equipment, urinal equipment and tap equipment intended for use over kitchen sinks, bathroom basins, laundry tubs or ablution troughs.

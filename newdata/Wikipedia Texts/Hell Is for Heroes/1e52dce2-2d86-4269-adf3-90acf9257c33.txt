== History ==


=== Early days ===
Will McGonagle and Joe Birch were previously in the British band Symposium. Their final release was in 1999 and, by the end of 2000, due to personal and musical differences, and problems with their record label, they had split up. Before long they joined up with their former school friends, James Findlay and Tom O'Donoghue, to form what would become with Hell is for Heroes, but they still lacked a lead singer. Justin Schlosberg was recruited through mutual friends.
In January 2001, they had performed their first gig at The Half Moon in Putney, London. In March that year they toured as support for Biffy Clyro, and at the end of that tour they had recruited a loyal fan base which meant the band caught the attention of major record labels. In July 2001, they signed with EMI. It took all that year before Hell Is for Heroes released their debut single on Superior Quality Recordings. It was a double A-side, featuring two songs that would later appear on their debut album, "Sick/Happy" and "Cut Down".
The band next released "You Drove Me To It" with the B-sides "Things Fall Apart" and "Kill the Silence" in January 2002. That year saw the release of two more singles, "I Can Climb Mountains" and "Nightvision". The latter track included "Folded Paper Figures" on the B-side, which became popular with their fanbase, and was later re-recorded and used on their second album.


=== The Neon Handshake ===
The Neon Handshake was issued in February 2003, and gained a positive reviews from the NME. It peaked at No. 16 in the UK Albums Chart. Hell is for Heroes' videos appeared regularly on major music television channels, and the band continued to tour across the UK keeping up their reputation as one of the premier live bands of the day. One performance of that time at The Astoria in London was filmed, and shown by MTV2.
In early 2003, "You Drove Me To It", which had been re-mastered for the album version was re-released as a single. Shortly after the release of the album, the band went on tour with Feeder for five dates of their UK tour. Hell Is for Heroes' live appearances included the Carling Weekend Reading and Leeds Festival on the BBC Radio 1 stage.
However, in 2004, changes within EMI saw Chrysalis Records, which owned the rights to Hell Is for Heroes closed down, and another subsidiary subsequently decide to part company with the band.


=== Transmit Disrupt ===
In May 2004, the band recorded their second album with the independent record label, Captains of Industry. The first single release was "One Of Us", which did not enjoy their previous major label's promotion efforts. "Models for the Programme" was then followed by "Kamichi" before the album's release. Transmit Disrupt flopped at No. 87 in the UK chart.
In September 2005, Hell Is for Heroes signed with Burning Heart Records. Transmit Disrupt was re-released, and "Models For The Programme" was given a new video. In February 2006, the band announced on their website that they had "come out of hibernation", and "New Song" appeared on the band's website. This was followed by a tour and, in July, "Eject Eject Eject", was available for free download on MySpace.


=== Hell Is For Heroes and Break Up ===
In February 2007, Hell is for Heroes began their UK, Ireland and European tour. "You've Got Hopes" was placed on the band's Myspace page. In April the band released the track listing of their new album on their official site. In June the band's third, eponymous album was released on Golf Records. Reviews and interviews in Kerrang! brought the album to a wider audience and the band embarked upon a sponsored tour throughout June, playing the Barfly venues in the UK. 
On 25 October 2007, Hell Is for Heroes stated:

Our forthcoming hop around the UK will be our last full length stint on the road before the reunion tour in 2037. We're up for spending more time at home working on other projects and potentially a fourth album if we can beat our last effort. Plus we reckon 7 years in the van is a fair stretch by any standards.

The band were forced to cancel three dates at the end of the 2007 tour due to illness. In October 2008, the band announced their final UK tour, with their final concert on 12 December 2008 at the Glasgow Barfly.


=== Recent Events ===
In June 2012, the band announced that they will be supporting Hundred Reasons at their upcoming 10th Anniversary shows, playing The Neon Handshake in full along with other songs from their back catalogue. Guitarist Will McGonagle commented on the upcoming shows, "We’ve been friends with Hundred Reasons for over 10 years, so when they suggested playing our first records together it sounded like fun. We are really proud of all the music we’ve made together and look forward to getting together to smash out The Neon Handshake. The early 2000s were exciting times for British rock music. It was a special time for our bands, who toured together and forged strong friendships. Who knows, maybe one day there’ll be a Shatterproof/Transmit Disrupt show too.". In August 2017, the band announced that they would be going on a headline tour in February 2018 playing The Neon Handshake in full to celebrate that record's 15th anniversary.
On 27 March 2018 it was announced that Hell is for Heroes would appear at Download festival.  They are due to appear on Friday 8 June on the 2nd stage. Second on the bill.

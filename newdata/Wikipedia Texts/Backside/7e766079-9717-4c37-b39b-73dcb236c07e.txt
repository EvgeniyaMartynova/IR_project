Advance-deposit wagering

Allowance race
A race for which entries are restricted to horses meeting certain earnings or other race criteria. The track operator's designated official (usually the Racing Secretary) establishes specific conditions that determine what weights are to be carried by any competing horse based on factors from the horse's previous performances including races won and/or earnings.

Allowances
Adjustments in weight "allowed" in a race. Examples are those granted because an apprentice is riding, for three-year-olds running against older horses, or for female horses running against male horses.  Sometimes the conditions of a particular race allow weight allowances for other reasons.

Allowance optional claiming

Charlie Big Potato

"Charlie Big Potato" was the first single taken from Post Orgasmic Chill by Skunk Anansie. The single came after the band switched record labels moving away from the independent label One Little Indian onto Virgin Records. It was released in March 1999, almost 2 years after their previous single. It reached number seventeen on the UK Singles Chart.
CD1 came with an interactive element featuring the video and CD 2 came with three specially produced polaroid photographs of the band. The song was a favourite at festivals and Skin often performs a slower version of the song at her solo gigs. It was also featured in the 2000 movie Hollow Man.


== Music video ==
The video was directed by Giuseppe Capotondi. The bizarre video shows the band appearing in different locations, with Skin waking up in a toilet, followed by a boy beginning to realise that his nightmares have become real.

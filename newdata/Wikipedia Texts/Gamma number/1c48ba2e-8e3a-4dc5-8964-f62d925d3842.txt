Veblen hierarchy

In mathematics, the Veblen functions are a hierarchy of normal functions (continuous strictly increasing functions from ordinals to ordinals), introduced by Oswald Veblen in Veblen (1908). If φ0 is any normal function, then for any non-zero ordinal α, φα is the function enumerating the common fixed points of φβ for β<α. These functions are all normal.


== The Veblen hierarchy ==
In the special case when  φ0(α)=ωα
this family of functions is known as the Veblen hierarchy. 
The function φ1 is the same as the ε function: φ1(α)= εα. If 
  
    
      
        α
        <
        β
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha <\beta \,,}
   then 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            α
          
        
        (
        
          φ
          
            β
          
        
        (
        γ
        )
        )
        =
        
          φ
          
            β
          
        
        (
        γ
        )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{\alpha }(\varphi _{\beta }(\gamma ))=\varphi _{\beta }(\gamma )\,.}
   From this and the fact that φβ is strictly increasing we get the ordering: 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            α
          
        
        (
        β
        )
        <
        
          φ
          
            γ
          
        
        (
        δ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{\alpha }(\beta )<\varphi _{\gamma }(\delta )}
   if and only if either (
  
    
      
        α
        =
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha =\gamma }
   and 
  
    
      
        β
        <
        δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta <\delta }
  ) or (
  
    
      
        α
        <
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha <\gamma }
   and 
  
    
      
        β
        <
        
          φ
          
            γ
          
        
        (
        δ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta <\varphi _{\gamma }(\delta )}
  ) or (
  
    
      
        α
        >
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha >\gamma }
   and 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            α
          
        
        (

        )
        <

  ).


=== Fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy ===
The fundamental sequence for an ordinal with cofinality ω is a distinguished strictly increasing ω-sequence which has the ordinal as its limit. If one has fundamental sequences for α and all smaller limit ordinals, then one can create an explicit constructive bijection between ω and α, (i.e. one not using the axiom of choice). Here we will describe fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy of ordinals. The image of n under the fundamental sequence for α will be indicated by α[n].
A variation of Cantor normal form used in connection with the Veblen hierarchy is — every nonzero ordinal number α can be uniquely written as

Γ0 is the Feferman–Schütte ordinal, i.e. it is the smallest α such that φα(0) = α.
For Γ0, a fundamental sequence could be chosen to be

=== Transfinitely many variables ===
More generally, Veblen showed that φ can be defined even for a transfinite sequence of ordinals αβ, provided that all but a finite number of them are zero. Notice that if such a sequence of ordinals is chosen from those less than an uncountable regular cardinal κ, then the sequence may be encoded as a single ordinal less than κκ. So one is defining a function φ from κκ into κ.
The definition can be given as follows: let α be a transfinite sequence of ordinals (i.e., an ordinal function with finite support) which ends in zero (i.e., such that α₀=0), and let α[0↦γ] denote the same function where the final 0 has been replaced by γ.  Then γ↦φ(α[0↦γ]) is defined as the function enumerating the common fixed points of all functions ξ↦φ(β) where β ranges over all sequences which are obtained by decreasing the smallest-indexed nonzero value of α and replacing some smaller-indexed value with the indeterminate ξ (i.e., β=α[ι₀↦ζ,ι↦ξ] meaning that for the smallest index ι₀ such that αι₀ is nonzero the latter has been replaced by some value ζ<αι₀ and that for some smaller index ι<ι₀, the value αι=0 has been replaced with ξ).
For example, if α=(ω↦1) denotes the transfinite sequence with value 1 at ω and 0 everywhere else, then φ(ω↦1) is the smallest fixed point of all the functions ξ↦φ(ξ,0,…,0) with finitely many final zeroes (it is also the limit of the φ(1,0,…,0) with finitely many zeroes, the small Veblen ordinal).
The smallest ordinal α such that α is greater than φ applied to any function with support in α (i.e., which cannot be reached “from below” using the Veblen function of transfinitely many variables) is sometimes known as the “large” Veblen ordinal.

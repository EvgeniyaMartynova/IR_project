Multi-purpose Attack Craft

Multi-Purpose Attack Craft (MPAC) is a type of fast attack/assault craft developed for the Philippine Navy. Originally designed to transport troops at a high speed and then land them on the beach, they have since expanded their roles to include interdiction, search & rescue and surface warfare.  
A total of 42 boats are needed by the Navy of which 12 have been completed as of September 2019.
The Mk 3 version of the MPAC are the very first ships in the entire history of the Philippine Navy to be officially armed with missiles.


== Construction ==
The MPAC's hull is made out of aluminum and is powered by water jet engines. It has a range of 560 km and a maximum speed of 40â€“45 knots, and carries a crew of 5-7 plus 8-16 fully equipped soldiers.Mk 1 and Mk 2 can deploy an Assault Ramp at their bow while in later versions this feature was removed.


== History ==


=== Mk 1 ===
In 2009, the Philippine Navy ordered the first batch of three ships from a Taiwanese company whose identity was never revealed. However, speculations point out that the manufacturer might be the Taiwanese company Lung Teh Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. These first three ships were commissioned into service during the Philippine Navy's 111th Anniversary on May 22, 2009. These first batch of boats are known as the Mark One (Mk 1) version. 


=== Mk 2 ===
In 2011, an additional three MPACs were built that were slightly bigger than the previous three ships, and these ships this time were built by the Filipino company Propmech Corp. The first of these second batch of MPACs was commissioned into service during the Philippine Navy's 114th Anniversary on May 22, 2012. The next two ships were commissioned on August 6, 2012. These second batch of boats are known as the Mark Two (Mk 2) version. 


=== Mk 3 ===
In 2016, Propmech was again contracted to build another three ships for USD 1.86 million (PHP 90 million) each and delivery was set for April 2017. The ships arrived without their armaments and were commissioned into service on May 22, 2017 as part of the Philippine Navy's Third Boat Attack Division of the Philippine Fleet's Littoral Combat Force. These third batch of boats are known as the Mark Three (Mk 3) version. The armaments for the Mk 3 were initially set to be delivered by December 2017, but were only actually delivered in May 2018.In May 2018, the DND revealed that they are studying a plan to arm the Mk 1 and Mk 2 versions of the MPAC with the same Spike ER missiles that are used also on the Mk 3 version.


=== Mk 4 ===
In September 2017, the Department of National Defense (DND) released a tender to procure an additional three MPAC vessels for the Philippine Navy which will be fourth batch. Budget is set at USD 1.77 million (PHP 90 million) each for the hulls only, but these will be armed similarly as the Mk 3 version. 
The bidding for these boats underwent Post-Qualification (PQ) in July 2018 while construction started in November 2018. These were then delivered in August 2019 and commissioned into service the following month in September 2019.


== Operational history ==
In May 2010, the MPACs got their first baptism of fire when they were used to extract Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) machines in Basilan under heavy mortar fire from rogue Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels attempting to sabotage the election.In September 2013, the MPACs led the search and rescue operations for the passengers of the ill-fated MV St. Thomas Aquinas owned by the 2GO Shipping Company. It collided with M/V Sulpicio Express Siete in Cebu resulting in more than 100 casualties.In the same month of September 2013 during the Zamboanga City Crisis, four MPACs were among those used to patrol the coastal villages of Zamboanga City and prevent the sympathizers of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in Basilan and Sulu from reinforcing their troops in Zamboanga.In September 2015, an MPAC participated in the 2015 PAGSISIKAP Fleet-Marine Amphibious Exercise in Ternate, Cavite by landing Philippine Marine Corps personnel into the beach.In March 2016, two MPACs of the Naval Forces Western Mindanao (NAVFORWESM) were used to intercept the M/L Fatima Radz-Auna off the coast of Arena Blanco, Zamboanga. The Radz-Auna was found with 1,500 5 kg sacks of smuggled Sugar with an estimated worth of PHP 3.15 million, and was immediately escorted to the Zamboanga Port and turned over to the Bureau of Customs.In December 2017, an MPAC Mk 2 (BA-485) was revealed to be assigned to guard the island province of Tawi-Tawi which lies near the Philippines' maritime border with Malaysia.In February 2018, two MPAC Mk 3 boats formed part of the 3rd Boat Attack Division under the operational control of the Joint Task Force - Malampaya of the Palawan-based Western Command (WesCom) where they will conduct patrol and rescue operations in the waters off Palawan, particularly around the Malampaya gas field area.In April 2018, the MPAC Mk 2 (BA-485) participated in the interception of the Mongolian registered M/V Diamond 8 vessel near the Olutanga Island in the province of Zamboanga Sibugay which was later found to be attempting to smuggle Php 67 million worth of rice. The sailors of BA-485 were later given the Bronze Cross Medal for this accomplishment in May 2018.In July 2018, the MPAC Mk 1 (BA-482) participated in the second leg of the 4th Combined Maritime Security Activity (MSA) with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in the waters around Tawi-Tawi along with the BRP Anastacio Cacayorin (PG-387) and BRP Felix Apolinario (PG-395) Patrol Crafts. The RAN sent the patrol vessels HMAS Ararat and HMAS Wollongong for the activity which consists of Meeting Procedures, Maritime Patrols and Ship Drills.In December 2018, an MPAC Mk 1 (BA-484) together with the BRP Waray (LC-288), BRP Agta (LC-290), BRP Juan Magluyan (PC-392), Philippine Marine Corps and Naval Special Operations Group units conducted an Amphibious Operation on Minis Island, Patikul, Sulu that resulted in the neutralization of seven Abu Sayyaf bandits, apprehension of 10 individuals and the recovery of several firearms and other war materials. The crew of BA-484 were later given the Military Merit Medal (Philippines) with Spearhead Device for their participation in the operation.

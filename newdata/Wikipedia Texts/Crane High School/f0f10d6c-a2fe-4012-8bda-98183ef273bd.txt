By May 2015 several news stories in Texas stated that there were about 20 cases of chlamydia at Crane High, out of about 300 students. A spokesperson of the Texas Department of State Health Services stated that the whole county, not only the high school, only had three cases of chlamydia. The state department also stated that in the year there were eight cases in the county as a whole and additional persons were undergoing testing. At the time Crane High used an abstinence only sex education program, and Justin Wm. Moyer of The Washington Post wrote "the problem has attracted attention to questions about the viability of abstinence education."The school board of Crane ISD was scheduled to adopt a new sex education curriculum on May 19, 2015.

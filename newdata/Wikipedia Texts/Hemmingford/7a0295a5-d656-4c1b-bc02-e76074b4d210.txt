Hemmingford, Quebec (township)

Hemmingford is a township municipality in south-west Quebec, founded in 1799. The population as of the Canada 2011 Census was 1,747. The township completely surrounds the Village of Hemmingford.

After creation in 1855, the territory of the township was successively partitioned in 1857, 1863 and 1878 to form to the new municipalities of Franklin, Havelock and the Village of Hemmingford respectively.


== Geography ==
The township of Hemmingford is located due south of Montreal in the Jardins-de-Napierville in the Montérégie region, in the south-east corner of the former Huntingdon County. It sits between what was the Seigniory of Beauharnois and Seigniory of Lacolle. Prior to its survey in 1792 and 1793, the Township was called "Waste lands". Known for their apple farms, Hemmingford is home to Petch Apple Orchards, one of the largest in Quebec.

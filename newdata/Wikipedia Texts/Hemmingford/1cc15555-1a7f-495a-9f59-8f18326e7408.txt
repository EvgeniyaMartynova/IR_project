== Disasters ==
The KDUH/CH4 TV Mast was a guyed TV mast constructed near Hemingford in 1969 for TV transmitting, and stood 1,964 feet (599 m) high, at 42°10′21″N 103°13′59″W.
The tower collapsed on September 24, 2002, during reconstruction work. Two tower workers, Lawrence A. Sukalec, 59, of Valier, Illinois, and Daniel E. Goff, 25, of Sesser, Illinois, were killed in the process, and three were injured on the ground. The collapse occurred as strengthening measures were being taken so the 30+ year-old tower could accommodate the added weight of digital television transmission facilities. Investigations later found that the contractors neglected to stabilize the tower while original structural components were being replaced with stronger ones.
KDUH resumed full-power broadcasts one year later from a new tower near Angora.


== In popular culture ==
Author Stephen King adapted Hemingford's name for the fictional town of Hemingford Home, Nebraska, which appears in several of his works.

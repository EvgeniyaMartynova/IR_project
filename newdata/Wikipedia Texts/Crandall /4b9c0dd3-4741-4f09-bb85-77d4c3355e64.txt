== History ==
Crandall was laid out in 1872 by its namesake, Cornelius F. Crandall.  Cornelius persuaded the builders of the Southern Railway (US) to move the planned route for their line through the area from its original surveyed path north of the present day State Highway 64 to its present path through the town of Crandall.    Cornelius later moved to Texas where he founded Crandall, Texas
In 1921 there was a great fire that destroyed a store and warehouse, the post office, and several houses on the east side of town; eleven buildings were destroyed in all.  The town sprang back from the destruction, and by 1936 Al Gerdon of the Corydon Democrat writes of the businessmen of Crandall.  He tells of an insurance salesman, the Crandall branch of the Harrison County Bank, the feed store, two general stores, the main office for the Harrison County Farm Bureau Corporation, Incorporated, and the well-known fox chasing conventions consisted of about seventy-five dogs that would chase the foxes on the outskirts of town.
During the 1930s Crandall became known for its saw mill and hatcheries that used the train to ship the baby chicks.  Clarence A. Sims, the owner of the Thornwood Poultry Yards, introduced the world's largest incubator at that time.  It was fifty-eight by ten feet and took a carload of eggs to fill its 315,000-egg capacity that enabled the hatchery to set 105,000 eggs every week.  Sixteen breeds of chickens were hatched and delivered to "every state east of the Rocky Mountains."  In June 1953 the passenger service ended thus leaving a freight line as the only rail service between Louisville and St. Louis.

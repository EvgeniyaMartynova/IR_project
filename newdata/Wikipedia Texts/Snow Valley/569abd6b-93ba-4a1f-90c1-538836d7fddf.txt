Snow Valley Ski Club

Snow Valley Ski Club is a ski area located inside Edmonton, Alberta just off the Whitemud Freeway in 119 Street in Rainbow Valley. The resort functions as a not-for-profit organization. The slope caters primary to beginner skiers and snowboarders, with only 15% of the area designated as advanced. 
It has one pulse quad chairlift, one triple chairlift, and two magic carpets. Snow Valley also has a variety of features and man made jumps in their beginner and advanced terrain parks. 


== History ==
Snow Valley was opened in 1961 by members of the Eskimo Ski Club. The original lodge was built in 1972 with two rope tows. In 1981 a T-bar replaced one of the rope tows, and limited snow making was added to extend the ski season. In 1988 a Triple chairlift was installed, along with expanded snow making capability. A significant amount of landfill was completed on the North Hill, where present-day terrain park is located.
During the summer of 1995, Snow Valley management took over responsibilities of the adjacent Rainbow Valley Campground. The campground operates in the summer off season. During the winter, additional parking and cross country ski tracks utilise the campground. 
A new 17,800-square-foot (1,650 m2) lodge was constructed in 2001, replacing the old lodge and maintenance buildings. Additionally in 2001 the first magic carpet was added. A second magic carpet replaced the handle tow in 2003. 
In 2008, Snow Valley opened a first-of-its-kind high-speed 'pulse' quad chair. This chair replaced the t-bar and opened up more terrain.

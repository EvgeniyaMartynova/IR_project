=== History ===
Tim Boyd bought the Wildwood Golf Course for $250,000 in 1977. In 1982 he converted the hills to a ski resort while maintaining the golf course.  The resort would be the first of several resorts throughout the Midwest and Northeast United States he developed or acquired through his company Peak Resorts.The resort is in the bluffs above the Meramec River. 
Boyd ultimately entered an agreement to place the ski resort in a conservation easement in exchange for permission to build 80 homes on the golf property (which has since been closed).At the beginning of the 2012-2013 season, Hidden Valley opened two additional runs on an adjacent hill. They dubbed this new area "West Mountain". With this expansion, one additional chair lift was added to allow access to these runs.
In January 2018, the City of Wildwood passed a vote to allow Hidden Valley to build a zip line tour to allow the property to open year round. The ZipTour opened in June 2019.

Prolintane

Prolintane (Catovit, Katovit, Promotil, Villescon) is a stimulant and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor developed in the 1950s. It is closely related in chemical structure to other drugs such as pyrovalerone, MDPV, and propylhexedrine and it has a similar mechanism of action. Many cases of prolintane abuse have been reported.Under the trade-name "Katovit", prolintane was commercialized by the Spanish pharmaceutical company, FHER. Katovit was sold until 2001, and was most often used by students and workers as a stimulant to provide energy, promote alertness and concentration.

Welcome to the Club (Ian Hunter album)

Welcome to the Club is the first live album by Ian Hunter. After the unexpected success of You're Never Alone with a Schizophrenic, Chrysalis Records wanted to keep the momentum by releasing another album. Because Hunter never wrote when he was on the road, it became a live album which was recorded at the Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood) over seven nights in November 1979 during his U.S tour. However, there were four new tracks (all of side four) three of which were recorded live in studio.

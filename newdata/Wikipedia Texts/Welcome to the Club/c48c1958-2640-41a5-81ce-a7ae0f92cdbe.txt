DJ Manian

Manuel Reuter (born July 7, 1978), better known by his stage name DJ Manian or just Manian, is a German music producer, DJ and owner of Zooland Records label. He was born in Bonn, Germany. He is also a member of the award-winning music dance trio Cascada, alongside fellow DJ Yanou (with whom he has collaborated many times) and Natalie Horler (who has featured as a guest vocalist on some of his songs). Currently he is a part of the duo twoloud.
DJ Manian has produced a number of singles under various pseudonyms. From September 2007 to September 2013 he contributed to the musical project "Spencer & Hill" under the pseudonym Josh Hill alongside the founder of Vengeance.de soudset website Manuel Schleis and with former Verano member Dennis Nicholls, with whom he created at the end of 2013 the musical project "Twoloud", however, the duo asked not to be identified immediately. In their performances they carried far face drawn hoods and in the music videos they are usually seen from behind on their single covers, they are not visible.
He also has maintained a number of different musical collaborations, including Bulldozzer, M.Y.C, Ampire, Phalanx, Plazmatek, Liz Kay, and R.I.O. and the now-defunct Tune Up! in addition to Aila, Cerla, Dan Winter, Darren Styles, Crystal Lake, etc. His 2013 release "Don't Stop the Dancing" featuring Carlprit has charted in a number of European singles charts.

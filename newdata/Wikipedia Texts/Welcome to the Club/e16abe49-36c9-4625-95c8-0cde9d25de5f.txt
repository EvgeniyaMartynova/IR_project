Tim McGraw (album)

Tim McGraw is the first studio album by American country music artist Tim McGraw, released in 1993. It includes the singles "What Room Was the Holiday In", "Welcome to the Club", "Two Steppin' Mind", and "Memory Lane", none of which reached the Top 40 on the country charts. This is the only studio album of McGraw's career not to achieve a music recording sales certification or to enter the Top Country Albums charts.

The album's lead single, "What Room was the Holiday In", was produced by Doug Johnson; the rest of the album was produced by Byron Gallimore (who has produced all of McGraw's subsequent work) and James Stroud.
The tracks "Memory Lane" and "Tears in the Rain" were co-written by Joe Diffie, and the former had been recorded by Keith Palmer on his debut album. "The Only Thing That I Have Left" had been recorded by George Strait on his Strait from the Heart album.


== Critical reception ==
Brian Mansfield and Thom Jurek of Allmusic rated the album two and a half stars out of five, saying that it was not memorable aside from three of its singles, but that it showed the "roots of [his] individuality".

Welcome to the Club (musical)

Welcome to the Club is a 1989 Broadway musical with music and lyrics by Cy Coleman. Despite its run of only twelve performances, it was nominated for two Tony Awards, and some other honors.
The musical, set in a New York City jail for alimony violators, opened on April 13, 1989 at the Music Box Theatre. The director of the production was Peter Mark Schifter.
Reviews were poor; the New York Times deemed it "embarrassingly out of touch with the present-day realities of men, women, sex, marriage and divorce", with limited praise given to Coleman's "inconsistent" score. The musical closed nine days after its opening, on April 22nd, and was considered a flop. However, the musical was nominated for two Tonys: Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Scott Wentworth) and Best Direction of a Musical (Schifter). In addition, actress Sally Mayes, in her Broadway debut, won a 1989 Theatre World award.

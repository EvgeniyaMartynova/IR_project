Parkgate, South Yorkshire

Parkgate is a suburb of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. It has since been consumed by its neighbour, Rawmarsh and is in the ward of Rawmarsh from which it has been indistinguishable since the early 20th century.


== Toponymy ==
Its name is said to originate from its location at the end point of the parkland of Wentworth Woodhouse. Although it marks the old entry gates of the parkland, the Wentworth estate stretched far past it, encompassing 90,000 acres of what was beautiful English countryside. The area gives its name to the Parkgate Seam, important in the South Yorkshire Coalfield.


== Economy ==
Parkgate is near the location of the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company.
It is also home to the Parkgate Shopping Outlet.


== Transport ==


=== Roads ===
The A633 runs through Parkgate.


=== Rail ===
The area was served by Parkgate and Rawmarsh railway station, originally named Rawmarsh which was situated in Parkgate, adjacent to the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company's works. It was constructed by the North Midland Railway and opened in 1840. The station was closed on 1 January 1968.
The area was also served by Parkgate and Aldwarke railway station which was opened in July 1873 by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway company. The station was originally known as "Aldwarke". The station was closed to passengers on 29 October 1951.
The nearest rail station now is Rotherham Central.


=== Tram-train ===
In August 2008 plans were announced for an extension to Sheffield Supertram to Rotherham Central station. In September 2009 it was decided that the extension would terminate at Parkgate Shopping Centre. The proposed route was to have been in operation by 2015, extended  to May 2018, eventually opening on 25 October 2018, only to be temporarily closed after a collision with a lorry on the first day of service. The motive power is a fleet of seven Vossloh Citylink Class 399 tram-trains which are specially equipped to operate on both tram and mainline railways, with a service frequency of three trains per hour.

The Greasbrough Canal, also known as Earl Fitzwilliam's Canal joins the River Don Navigation at Parkgate. Both are part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation.

Sir John A. Macdonald High School

Sir John A. Macdonald High School is a Canadian high school serving the western suburbs of Nova Scotia's Halifax Regional Municipalityâ€”namely the communities of Beechville, Lakeside, Timberlea and Tantallon. Sir John A's feeder schools are Five Bridges Junior High School and Ridgecliff Middle School.
The original Sir John A. Macdonald High School was built in the 1960s. The mascot is the "Flame," hence the team name "Sir John A. Flames." The new complex finished construction in 2007.
In 2013 the SJA Flames football team went on to finally overcome their rivals in the city the Citadel High Phoenix in the semi finals 31-17. Putting to what was thought to be an unstoppable force to a halt.  One week later they went on to beat the CPA Cheetahs in an amazing spectacle of a game with a total score of 24-23 win. This was the school's first championship in football in the team's existence since 2005.
The old building for the school was located in the HRM community of Hubley. The new Sir John A Macdonald High School is located in Tantallon. The old school is now called Five Bridges Junior High School. The new school was opened in 2006.

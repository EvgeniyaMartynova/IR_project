Museum de Oude Wolden

Museum de Oude Wolden (Dutch pronunciation: [myˈzeːjʏm də ˌʔʌudə ˈʋɔldə(n)]; English: Museum The Old Wolds), abbreviated as MOW, is a regional museum in the village of Bellingwolde in the Netherlands. The museum focuses on art and history of the regions of Oldambt and Westerwolde in the east of the province of Groningen.
The museum opened on 10 August 1973. In the first decades, it primarily exhibited historical objects documenting everyday life. In the late 1990s, the museum started to exhibit artworks of artist collective De Ploeg and magic realist painter Lodewijk Bruckman. Since 2012, it has a permanent display of paintings by Bruckman and temporary exhibitions.
The museum is an independent foundation that is mainly funded by the municipality of Bellingwedde. From 2013 to 2016, the museum had around 4,700 visitors per year. It is one of the lesser-visited museums in Groningen.


== Location ==
Museum de Oude Wolden is located at the Hoofdweg in the village Bellingwolde in the municipality Bellingwedde in the east of the province Groningen near the Dutch–German border. It is situated in the south of the region Oldambt and in the north of the region Westerwolde.
The old museum building is the restored backhouse (Dutch: achterhuis) of a former mansion (Dutch: herenhuis) of which the fronthouse was destroyed during a World War II bombing. In 1977, the building was expanded with a new wing for 150,000 guilders (68,000 euro). In 2012, the building was renovated and received a new glass entrance, which cost 223,000 euro in total.


== History ==
Streekmuseum de Oude Wolden (Regional Museum the Old Wolds) was opened on 10 August 1973 by the mayor of Bellingwedde Jurjen Jan Hoeksema. In the late 1960s, the province of Groningen requested the national government for subsidy to open a new museum in Bellingwolde. The subsidy was not granted, but the state paid indirectly for the restoration of the museum building via a subsidized employment project.In 1976, the museum exhibited primarily historical objects from the regions of Oldambt and Westerwolde, such as agricultural machines, traditional costumes, and archaeological and geological finds. After the expansion in 1977, the museum had enough space to hold temporary exhibitions, group the historical objects thematically, and display a 19th-century grocery store inventory. By the late 1980s, a barber shop and shoemaker's inventory were shown in the museum. In 1988, the newspaper Nieuwsblad van het Noorden called the museum "charming" and wrote: "A museum like De Oude Wolden is meaningful because of its rather complete documentation of everyday life in the 19th and early 20th century."In 1998, the museum started to exhibit paintings by artists of De Ploeg, an artist collective established in the city Groningen. In 1999, the museum also exhibited paintings by Lodewijk Bruckman, who lived in Bellingwedde for some years. At the time, the press described De Oude Wolden as a museum with historical artefacts and artworks by De Ploeg and Bruckman. In 2003, De Ploeg celebrated their 85th birthday with an exhibition in the museum. In 2010, seven 17–19th-century icons with an estimated value of 23,000 euro were stolen during a break-in in the museum. At the time, the museum offered a reward of 2,500 euro for tips that would lead to the recovery of the icons.The museum dropped the word streek (regional) from its name and now calls itself Museum de Oude Wolden (Museum the Old Wolds). Since the renovation in 2012, the historical objects and the artworks by De Ploeg are no longer on permanent display, the museum now focuses on art, region, and history with Bruckman's paintings and temporary exhibitions. In 2017, the museum became an independent foundation, although the municipality of Bellingwedde still owns the building and the collection.


== Exhibitions ==


=== Lodewijk Bruckman ===
The museum has a permanent exhibition of paintings by Lodewijk Bruckman (1903–1995). Bruckman lived in Bellingwolde in a hotel opposite to the museum from 1987 to 1989. He donated 21 paintings to the Bellingwedde municipality in 1988. These paintings, which are now exhibited in the museum, are mostly still lifes in a style which is described as realistic, surrealistic, or magic realistic.


=== Temporary exhibitions ===
The museum has two concurrent temporary exhibitions: a larger exhibition spanning several months and a smaller monthly exhibition that features a regional artist. The smaller exhibitions are called 24K, which refers to an area around the museum with a radius of 24 kilometers where the artists are from and the supposed 24 carat quality of the artworks.The larger temporary exhibitions since the renovation in 2012 include:

Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge

The Parkersburg–Belpre Bridge is a four-lane cantilever bridge that connects Parkersburg, West Virginia to Belpre, Ohio across the Ohio River. The bridge was completed in 1980. The bridge had been signed U.S. Route 50 (US 50) until June 13, 2008, when that highway was re-routed to the Blennerhassett Island Bridge a few miles to the west, as part of the completion of the Corridor D project around Parkersburg. The American Discovery Trail uses the bridge to cross the Ohio River.

The current bridge replaced a 1916 suspension bridge located just downstream of the present site. The bridge was designed by Hermann Lamb and built by the John A. Roebling's Sons Company of New Jersey. The bridge had a 22-foot-wide (6.7 m) deck, which included a pedestrian walkway. The main span was 275 feet (84 m) and the side spans were 275 feet (84 m) and 375 feet (114 m).  The suspension bridge was demolished on March 16, 1980.

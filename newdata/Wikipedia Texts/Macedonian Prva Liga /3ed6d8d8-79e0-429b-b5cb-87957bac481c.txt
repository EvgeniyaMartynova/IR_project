== History ==
In 1923 the first  national Yugoslav Football Championship was held, and regional championships were also played.  The clubs of the Vardarska Banovina, territorially similar to present day Macedonia, played within the Belgrade Football Subassociation League until 1927, when a separate Skoplje Football Subassociation League was formed.  The champions of the Subassociation Leagues were granted a place in the qualifiers to the Yugoslav Championship.  Gragjanski Skopje became the only Macedonian club to participate in the national league, first in 1935–36 when the championship was played in a cup format, and then in 1938–39, when it was played in a normal league system with Gragjanski finishing 10th out of 12 teams.  In 1939 the Yugoslav league system was changed, with the creation of separate Serbian and Croato-Slovenian Leagues which served as qualifying leagues for the final phase of the Yugoslav Championship.  The clubs from the Skopje Subassociation aimed to qualify to the Serbian League, however only Gragjanski managed to participate, in 1939–40 (5th place) and 1940–41 (8th place).

The new pope named Cardinal Orsini papal legate to the March of Ancona on September 22, 1484.In 1486, because of the conflict between the pope and the Orsini family, he traveled to Rome to attempt to effect a reconciliation, but left a short time later.In 1488 or 1489, he opted for the deaconry of Santa Maria Nova.On November 5, 1490, he became apostolic administrator of the metropolitan see of Taranto, holding this office until September 24, 1498.He participated in the papal conclave of 1492 that elected Pope Alexander VI.  On August 31, 1492, the new pope named him papal legate to the March of Ancona.On February 27, 1493, he opted for the order of cardinal priests and received the titular church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo.He was ordained as a priest in his titular church on March 12, 1493.When Charles VIII of France came to Rome on December 31, 1494 as part of the Italian Wars, Cardinal Orsini went with the pope to the Castel Sant'Angelo.  On January 21, 1495, he was elected Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals.  On May 27, 1495, with a French army approaching Rome, Cardinal Orsini left with the pope for Orvieto.

Cardinal Orsini was soon thereafter arrested on the pope's orders and flung into the Castel Sant'Angelo.  He died there twelve days later, on February 22, 1503, probably poisoned on the orders of the pope or Cesare Borgia.

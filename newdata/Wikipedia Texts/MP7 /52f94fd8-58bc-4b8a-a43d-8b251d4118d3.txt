Mammal Paleogene zones

The Mammal Paleogene zones or MP zones are biostratigraphic zones in the stratigraphic record of the Paleogene period of Europe. These zones were proposed at the Congress in Mainz held in 1987 (Schmidt-Kittler 1987)  to help paleontologists provide more specific reference points to evolutionary events in Europe, but are used by paleontologists on other continents as well. MP 1 is the earliest zone, and MP 30 is the most recent. The MP zones are complementary with the MN zones in the Neogene.

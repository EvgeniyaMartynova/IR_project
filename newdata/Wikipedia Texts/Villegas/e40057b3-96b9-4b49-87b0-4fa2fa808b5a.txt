Jason Villegas

Jason Villegas (born August 16, 1977 in Houston, TX) is currently a New York City based contemporary artist.  He has exhibited across the United States and internationally.  Villegas' work utilizes a wide spectrum of mediums including sculpture, installation, painting, drawing, textile, video and performance.  He has created his own artistic realm and visual language in which to explore concepts such as globalism, evolution, sexuality, cosmology, and consumerism.  Motifs in Villegas' artworks include fashion logos, animal hybrids, weaponry, sales banners, clothing piles, anuses, cosmic debris, taxidermy, bear men, amorphous beasts, religious iconography, and party scenarios.


== Phantom Sightings ==
Jason Villegas was a part of the traveling group exhibition Phantom Sightings: Art After the Chicano Movement, curated by Rita Gonzales, Howard Fox, and Chen Noriega.  Beginning at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in 2008, the exhibit toured for two years including renowned spaces such as, the Tamayo Museum in Mexico City, El Museo del Barrio in New York City, the Phoenix Art Museum (PAM) in Arizona,  Museo de Arte de Zappopan in Guadalajara, and the Museo Alameda in San Antonio.  His selected work "Celestial Situation" (2006) featured a wall mural of painting and drawing depicting planetary spheres of cosmic clutter involving a video projection of animated 2D artworks onto a drawing of compressed entertainment electronics and media.  The animation reveals a consumption cosmology of anuses, amorphous beasts, and a rotund man watching television.


== Education ==
Villegas earned his MFA in 2007 at the Mason Gross School of Art at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ and his BFA in 2003 at the University of Houston in Texas.

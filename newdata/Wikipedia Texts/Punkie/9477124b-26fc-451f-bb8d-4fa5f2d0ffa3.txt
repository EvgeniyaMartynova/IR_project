Dutty Rock

Dutty Rock (West Indian patois for "dirty rock") is the second studio album by Jamaican reggae/dancehall artist Sean Paul. It was released on 12 November 2002. It features two US number-one singles, "Get Busy" and Beyoncé's "Baby Boy" (which Sean Paul features on). It also features singles "Gimme the Light", "Like Glue" and "I'm Still in Love with You", which all charted in the top 6 on the UK Singles Chart. The album itself reached number 2 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 9 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart. It is also his first album to have a Parental Advisory sticker. The album sold 65,000 in its first week and went on to become an international phenomenon, selling over 6 million worldwide, and in the process produced five top 15 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. The song "Top of the Game" was featured in NBA Live 2004.
In 2003, Sean Paul released an edited version of the album intended for international markets. The re-release took off all skits and the single "It's On", also featuring the now accessible hit single "Baby Boy". The single is a duet by Beyoncé and Sean Paul. It became one of the biggest hits in 2003 spending nine weeks at number one. The album sold over 2 million copies in the United States and helped Sean Paul become a Grammy Award-winning artist. Also, the version of "Punkie" is a remix and features Puerto Rican artist Tego Calderón singing his part in Spanish.

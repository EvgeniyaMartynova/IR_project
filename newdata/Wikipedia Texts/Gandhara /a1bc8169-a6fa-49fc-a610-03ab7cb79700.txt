Gandhara (song)

"Gandhara" (ガンダーラ, Gandāra) is a song by Japanese rock band Godiego, serving as their 7th single. "Gandhara" was used as the ending theme song for the first season of the television drama Saiyūki, known in the English speaking world as Monkey. "Gandhara" was originally released in Japan on October 1, 1978, but it was later released in the United Kingdom in 1980 to coincide with the British broadcast of Monkey. "Gandhara" reached number 2 on both the Oricon and The Best Ten charts in Japan, while the British release reached 56 on the UK Singles Chart.
Godiego recorded the song in both Japanese and English, with a hybrid Japanese & English version being included on the releases in the UK. The entirely English version appears on the album Magic Monkey in Japan.

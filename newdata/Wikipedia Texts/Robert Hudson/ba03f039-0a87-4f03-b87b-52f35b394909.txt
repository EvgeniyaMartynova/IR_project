Robert Hudson (broadcaster)

Robert Cecil Hudson (30 January 1920 – 3 June 2010) was a British broadcaster and administrator for the BBC, primarily on radio but also on television, between 1947 and 1981.  He commentated on cricket and rugby union, as well as on many state occasions.  He also covered a number of royal tours abroad.  He was particularly noted for the thoroughness of the research that he conducted in preparation for his broadcasts.  He was responsible for the launch of Test match Special (TMS) in 1957, having written to his boss Charles Max-Muller the previous year, proposing the broadcasting of full ball-by-ball coverage of Tests instead of the existing coverage of limited fixed periods. His obituary in The Times described him as "a man of transparent integrity whose reserved manner and innate modesty meant that he became less of a celebrity than his great ability would otherwise have guaranteed".

After the war he obtained a degree from the London School of Economics.

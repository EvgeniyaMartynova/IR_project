== History ==
The name Ucar derives from the Turkic word "Ucqar" meaning "remote", as Ucar was remote from the Shirvanshah capital at Baku, and on the frontier of the Shirvan state.Before, the territory of the Ujar region was part of the Shirvan Beylerbey, later Shamakhi khanate. On April 10, 1840,  according to the administrative reform, it was the part of Caspian Province, and in 1846, joined to the Shamakhi Governorate. After the Shamakhi earthquake in 1859, the center of the Governorate moved to Baku.  In December 1867, Goychay Uyezd was established in the territory of Baku province. At that time, the district was part of the Goychay Uyezd. In 1930, the Uyezd was abolished and the district was transferred to the administrative unit. Thus, the Ujar Rayon was created on 24 January 1939 as an independent administrative unit from part of Goychay region. The territory of region was changed in 1963. Thus, Zardab district was abolished in 1963 with its territory joined to the Ujar district. In 1965, the Zardab district was separated from Ucar when it was restored as an independent region.

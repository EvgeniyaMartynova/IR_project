Wellfleet Center Historic District

The Wellfleet Center Historic District is a historic district in Wellfleet, Massachusetts.  It encompasses resources that exemplify the development of the community, beginning in the late 18th century, as a thriving commercial maritime center, and then its rise as a summer resort community in the late 19th century.  Buildings in the district include Cape-style houses from the mid-18th century, 19th century commercial and institutional buildings in the town center, and the 1880s summer estate of Lorenzo Dow Baker.  The district is roughly bounded by Cross St., Holbrook Ave., Main, E. Main and School Streets, and Duck Creek, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

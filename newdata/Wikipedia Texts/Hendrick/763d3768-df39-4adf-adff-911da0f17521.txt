Hendrick Motorsports

Hendrick Motorsports (HMS), originally named All Star Racing, is an American professional stock car racing team that currently competes in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. The team, created in 1984 by Rick Hendrick, is one of stock car racing's premier organizations. As of 2018, Hendrick Motorsports has won twelve Monster Energy Cup Series owners and drivers championships, three Truck Series owners and drivers titles, and one Nationwide Series drivers crown, 252 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series victories, 26 Xfinity Series wins, and 26 Camping World Truck Series victories. As of the 2016 season, the team has won a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race on every track on the current circuit â€“ except for Kentucky Speedway, which has only been on the circuit since 2011.Hendrick Motorsports currently fields four full-time Monster Energy Cup Series teams with the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, including the No. 9 NAPA/Hooters/Mountain Dew/Kelley Blue Book for Chase Elliott, the No. 24 Liberty University/Axalta/UniFirst/Hertz for William Byron, the No. 48 Ally Financial for Jimmie Johnson, and the No. 88 Nationwide Insurance/Axalta Coating Systems/LLumar/Valvoline for Alex Bowman. The team formerly fielded teams in the now-NASCAR Xfinity Series before merging its efforts with JR Motorsports. Hendrick Motorsports also fielded several trucks in the NASCAR Truck Series, most recently for development driver Chase Elliott in 2013. The team has fielded cars in the past for many NASCAR drivers, including Hall of Famers Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin, Terry Labonte, Darrell Waltrip and Benny Parsons and other notables such as Geoff Bodine, Tim Richmond, Ricky Rudd, Ken Schrader, Ricky Craven, Joe Nemechek, Kyle Busch, Casey Mears, Brian Vickers, Kasey Kahne, and Dale Earnhardt Jr.
All Hendrick race cars are constructed start-to-finish at the 100-plus acre Hendrick Motorsports complex in Concord, North Carolina. More than 550 engines are built or re-built on-site each year, with the team leasing some of those to Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR). They currently have a technical alliance with JTG Daugherty Racing. Hendrick Motorsports employs over 500 people that perform many day-to-day activities. Since 1995, Hendrick Motorsports have won 12 NASCAR Premier series championships; a record tying 7 for Jimmie Johnson, 4 for Jeff Gordon and 1 for Terry Labonte.


== History ==

What is now Hendrick Motorsports was founded prior to the 1984 season by Rick Hendrick, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based car dealership owner who currently operates a network of dealerships called Hendrick Auto Group. The team was formed along with longtime crew chief and car builder Harry Hyde, NHRA and NASCAR team owner Raymond Beadle, and music entrepreneur C.K. Spurlock as All-Star Racing. The team, called Hendrick Motorsports by 1985, expanded to two full-time cars in 1986, three in 1987, and four in 2002. HMS was one of the first teams in NASCAR to be successful operating multiple entries, based on the model used at the Hendrick dealerships. The team has also been credited for innovations in engine construction and pit crew training.

=== Car No. 5 history ===


==== Geoffrey Bodine (1984-1989) ====
The No. 5 debuted in 1984 under the banner "All Star Racing" with five employees, rented equipment, and two cars, with the highest-paid person's wages at only $500/week. Initially, the team had planned to field a car for seven-time Cup champion Richard Petty with funding from country music business mogul C.K. Spurlock, but the deal failed to materialize. Afterwards, Hendrick attempted to hire Tim Richmond, then Dale Earnhardt, but did not. As a result, the team signed former Rookie of the Year Geoff Bodine to drive the unsponsored No. 5 Chevy Monte Carlo for 1984. After a slow start seven races into the season, Hendrick informed Bodine and crew chief Harry Hyde that he planned to shut down the team due to funding trouble. Instead, Bodine and the team won at Martinsville Speedway, leading to sponsorship from Northwestern Security Life; on March 30, 2014, the 30-year anniversary of the win, Hendrick stated, "We owe Martinsville so much. If we hadn't won that race, then literally the next Monday we were going to shut it down." The team won two more times and finished ninth in points. Levi Garrett came on to sponsor the No. 5 Chevy in 1985 as part of a multi-year deal. Despite not winning a race that year, Bodine earned three poles and improved to fifth in points. The team briefly became a two-car operation when Dick Brooks drove the No. 1 Exxon Chevy at Charlotte Motor Speedway, in what proved to be Brooks' last NASCAR race.

Hendrick expanded into a multi-car team full-time in 1986, with Bodine and Tim Richmond as drivers. Bodine won twice in the No. 5 and posted an eighth-place finish in points. His younger brother, Brett, raced as a teammate in the World 600 that year. Bodine went winless again in 1987, finishing thirteenth in points. Bodine won one race each of the next two years before leaving for Junior Johnson & Associates in 1990.


==== Ricky Rudd (1990-1993) ====
Ricky Rudd took Bodine's place, winning once at Watkins Glen International, and finishing seventh in points. For 1991, the team received sponsorship from Tide as part of the car's merger with Darrell Waltrip's old team. Winning one race that year, Rudd finished a career high second in points behind champion Dale Earnhardt. On the final lap of that year's race at Sears Point Raceway, second-place Rudd spun out leader Davey Allison on the last turn and went on to win. NASCAR penalized the team for rough driving and awarded Allison the win. Rudd won once each of the next two years. Dissatisfied with the distribution of resources within HMS's multiple teams, Rudd left to form his own team, taking Tide with him.


==== Terry Labonte (1994-2004) ====
Rudd's replacement was 1984 Winston Cup champion Terry Labonte. The car received sponsorship from Kellogg's and their Corn flakes brand. Labonte won three races each in 1994 and 1995, and defeated teammate Jeff Gordon for the 1996 Winston Cup championship by 37 points. Labonte won one race each of the next three seasons. The 2000 season was a very difficult year for the team as two long streaks that defined Labonte's career came to an end. In the Pepsi 400, Labonte crashed his car and broke his leg. After an accident at New Hampshire damaged his inner ear, Labonte was not capable of driving, and he ended up missing two races, bringing his streak of most consecutive races to an abrupt end. Todd Bodine and Ron Hornaday, Jr. subbed for Labonte. His six-year winning streak was also broken as he failed to visit victory lane that year.At the end of the 2000 season Labonte's team switched to Kellogg's Frosted Flakes brand for its primary sponsorship. After a couple of low-key years, Labonte finished tenth in the points in 2003. He also revisited victory lane after a four-year drought by winning the Southern 500 at Darlington, the last Southern 500 to be held during the Labor Day weekend until 2015. After slipping to twenty-sixth in points in 2004, Labonte announced his semi-retirement. He would drive a limited schedule for two years in the No. 44 car before leaving HMS after the 2006 season. Labonte scored 12 victories with Hendrick Motorsports, to go along with his championship in 1996.


==== Kyle Busch (2005-2007) ====

Hendrick tabbed development driver Kyle Busch, the younger brother of Kurt Busch, as Labonte's replacement for the 2005 season. Busch easily won the 2005 rookie of the year battle and made history when he took the checkered flag in the Sony HD 500 at California Speedway for his first win, becoming the youngest driver to ever win a Cup Series race at the age of 20 years, 4 months, and 2 days. Busch would win later that year at Phoenix. In 2006, Kyle won once and qualified for the Chase for the Nextel Cup, ultimately finishing tenth in points. In 2007, Busch grabbed a win at the Food City 500, the inaugural race for the Car of Tomorrow. On June 13, 2007 Hendrick announced that Kyle Busch would not return to drive the No. 5 car in 2008.


==== Casey Mears (2008) ====
On September 4, 2007 it was announced that Casey Mears would drive the No. 5 in 2008. On June 22, 2008, ESPN.com reported that Mark Martin would leave Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to replace Casey Mears in the No. 5 car for the 2009 season. On Friday, July 4 at Daytona International Raceway, Hendrick and Martin announced that Martin had agreed to a two-year contract in the No. 5 car.


==== Mark Martin (2009-2011) ====
Mark Martin scored his first win with Hendrick Motorsports at Phoenix on April 18, 2009. He became the third oldest winner and fourth driver over the age of 50 to win a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race. The win was also the 36th victory and 400th top 10 of Martin's career. Martin won four more races in 2009, Darlington, Michigan, Chicagoland, and New Hampshire. He also won seven pole positions in addition to finishing second in the point standings to teammate Jimmie Johnson. On September 18, 2009, Hendrick announced that Martin had extended his contract through the 2011 season and would race full-time with GoDaddy.com as a primary sponsor.

In 2010, Martin struggled, ending the season 13th in the point standings with no wins and only one pole position, which came in the Daytona 500. His season best finish of second came in October at Martinsville. Lance McGrew took over as crew chief for the No. 5 in 2011 as Gustafson moved to Jeff Gordon's team. Farmers Insurance Group and Quaker State joined as sponsors of the team for a few races. Martin struggled through most of the season with McGrew, not showing signs of his earlier Hendrick success. Teammate Jimmie Johnson drove the No. 5 car in the All-Star Race to promote a discount deal with Lowe's (Martin moved over to the No. 25 for the evening). Martin ended the year 22nd in points, having won two pole positions, the second races at both Daytona and Talladega. The team scored only two top fives all season, a second at Dover and a fourth at Michigan.


==== Kasey Kahne (2012-2017) ====
Kasey Kahne and his crew chief Kenny Francis were picked up from Red Bull Racing Team to run the No. 5 in 2012. Farmers and Quaker State returned, with Farmers increasing its sponsorship to 22 races. GoDaddy.com left for Tommy Baldwin Racing/Stewart-Haas Racing to sponsor Danica Patrick, but Time Warner Cable and Great Clips signed on as replacements. After a poor start to the season, Kahne rebounded immensely and picked up a win in the Coca-Cola 600. He won again at New Hampshire in July and made the 2012 Chase, finishing a career-best 4th in standings. Kahne also won four pole positions throughout the season.

Kahne won twice in 2013, at Bristol in March and Pocono in August, and again qualified for the Chase in 2013. However, he fell toward the bottom of the Chase standings and ended up finishing 12th in points. The team struggled immensely in 2014, and it did not appear that Kahne would qualify for the 2014 Chase until a last-minute win at Atlanta in late August locked him into the Chase field. Kahne was eliminated from the Chase following the October Talladega race (as a result of a new Chase format) and finished 15th in the final point standings. Kahne then struggled in 2015 & 2016 as he barely missed the Chase field and failed to reach victory lane in both seasons. On July 23, 2017 Kahne held off Brad Keselowski in an overtime finish that ended under caution to win the 2017 Brickyard 400 for his 18th(& final) overall career victory, 102 races after his 2014 Atlanta victory. The race was also the reason that the NASCAR sanctioning body eliminated the Overtime Line.
On August 20, 2017, Hendrick Motorsports announced that William Byron would take over the No. 5 in 2018, with Darian Grubb as crew chief. Twenty days later, the team changed the No. 5 to No. 24. Kahne ended up being locked into the Chase field in 2017 with his Brickyard 400 victory but wound up being eliminated after the first round and finishing 15th in the final point standings.

=== Car No. 9 history ===

Chase Elliott (2018â€“present)After the 2017 season, the No. 24 car driven by Chase Elliott was renumbered to the No. 9 in honor of Elliott's father, 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series Champion Bill Elliott. After struggling throughout the first half of the 2018 season, Elliott scored his first stage win at the New Hampshire race. On August 5, 2018, Elliott scored his first cup win at the Watkins Glen, giving Hendrick Motorsports its 250th race win and securing him in the Playoffs. He added two wins at Dover and Kansas during the Playoffs. Elliott made it all the way to the Round of 8 before he was eliminated by a late crash with Kurt Busch and Denny Hamlin at Phoenix. He finished the season sixth in points.
In the 2019 season, Elliott scored his fourth career win at Talladega. He also defeated Martin Truex Jr. at Watkins Glen for the second year in a row.However, in the playoffs, he had issues. While he scored a clutch win at Bank of America Roval 400 and finished 2nd at Kansas, along with a top 4 at Las Vegas and a top 8 at Talladega, he was largely inconsistent and had 4 DNFs. As a result, he fell to 10th in the standings, being only one position ahead of William Byron and two spots ahead of Alex Bowman. At the end, he grabbed 3 wins, 4 poles, only 11 top 5s, only 15 top 10s, and his average finish plummeted from a 12.2 last season to a 15.1 this season, led only 601 laps, and went on finish 10th in points, despite 4 finishes outside the top 10 in a row. He also got 6 DNFs in 2019, 3rd most of any driver in the 2019 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.

=== Car No. 17 history ===
Darrell Waltrip (1987-1990)
The No. 17 car at Hendrick Motorsports came about when Darrell Waltrip left Junior Johnson's team following the 1986 season in order to end his relationship with Budweiser. Waltrip chose to join Hendrick Motorsports with Tide as his sponsor and 17 as his car number. Waltrip won nine races in his first three seasons with Hendrick, including the Daytona 500 in 1989, a race that had eluded him for many years.
While practicing for his 500th career start in the 1990 Pepsi 400 at Daytona, Waltrip's car spun in oil laid down by another car experiencing engine failure and was hit by Dave Marcis. Waltrip suffered a broken arm, a broken leg, and a concussion. He missed the Pepsi 400, but came back to run one lap at Pocono, before giving way to Jimmy Horton as a relief driver. After Pocono, Waltrip sat out the next five races due to his injuries. Despite missing six races, Waltrip finished 20th in driver points and the team finished 5th in owner points with substitute drivers taking turns in the car â€“ Greg Sacks' second-place finish at Michigan, in August, was the best finish of the team's season. The team scored only one DNF for the season, when Sarel van der Merwe crashed late in the race at Watkins Glen. However, in the 23 races that Waltrip did start, he failed to win for the first time since 1974. At the end of the 1990 season, Waltrip decided he wanted to start his own team, so he left Hendrick Motorsports, taking the No. 17 with him. The Tide sponsorship moved to the flagship No. 5 team with Ricky Rudd as the driver and remained there until the end of the 1993 season.

=== Car No. 25 history ===


==== Tim Richmond (1986-1987) ====
Car No. 25 was owned for many years by Rick Hendrick's father, Joe "Papa" Hendrick. It debuted in 1986 as HMS's second team, with a Folgers sponsorship and Tim Richmond driving. Richmond was teamed with veteran crew chief Harry Hyde, who moved over from the No. 5 team after chemistry issues with Geoff Bodine. Richmond won seven times that year and finished third in points. He missed the beginning of the 1987 season due to HIV/AIDS, while publicly saying he was suffering from pneumonia. Benny Parsons drove the first eleven races of the season, with the car renumbered 35; Darrell Waltrip was hired to drive Hendrick's third car at this time. Richmond returned midway through the season and won his first two races, at Pocono and Riverside. Following a blown engine at Michigan and deteriorating health, he left the ride after only eight starts. He died in August 1989.


==== Ken Schrader (1988-1996) ====
In 1988, Ken Schrader took over the ride, winning the pole at the season opening Daytona 500. He won two pole positions, won the Talladega DieHard 500, and finished fifth in points. He won four more poles in 1989 and picked up a victory in the fall race at Charlotte. Kodiak replaced Folgers as the sponsor of the No. 25 for the 1990 season. Schrader failed to win a race in 1990, but he won the Daytona 500 pole for the third year in a row. He won two more races in 1991 and finished ninth in points. Schrader did not win again, but he finished a career-best fourth in points in 1994. After that year, Budweiser replaced Kodiak as the sponsor. Schrader left the team after the 1996 season and was replaced by Ricky Craven.


==== Ricky Craven (1997-1998) ====
Craven helped Hendrick complete a 1â€“2â€“3 finish in the 1997 Daytona 500 by finishing third behind winner Jeff Gordon and second-place Terry Labonte. After suffering a concussion at Texas, he missed two races. Jack Sprague and Todd Bodine filled in for him during the injury. The other highlight for Craven during the 1997 campaign was a Winston Open win. Craven ultimately finished nineteenth in points. In 1998, to honor NASCAR's fiftieth anniversary, the No. 25 car changed its number to 50 for the season. Shortly after the season started Craven, still feeling the effects from his concussion the year before, was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome. Randy LaJoie and Wally Dallenbach, Jr. filled in while Craven recovered. Craven returned to driving at his home track, New Hampshire, and won the pole for the event, but after four more races Hendrick permanently replaced Craven with Dallenbach, who had put together the stronger run of the two substitute drivers.


==== Wally Dallenbach Jr. (1998-1999) ====
With the team back to racing the No. 25 with Dallenbach behind the wheel, the team raced to an eighteenth-place finish in points 1999. However, Dallenbach left the team to drive for a new team and Budweiser moved over to sponsor Dale Earnhardt, Inc.'s No. 8 car in 2000 and the team needed to hire a replacement and find a sponsor. Homebuilder and television personality Michael Holigan came on to sponsor the car for 2000 and Hendrick hired driver Jerry Nadeau. Nadeau had most recently been driving for MB2 Motorsports as a replacement for a retired Ernie Irvan, who - due to injuries - was pulled out of NASCAR midway through 1999.


==== Jerry Nadeau (2000-2002) ====
Nadeau had a solid first year with Hendrick, finishing twentieth in points and winning the season-ending race at Atlanta. The team returned for 2001 with UAW and Delphi as co-sponsors, and Nadeau finished a career high seventeenth in points while nearly repeating his Atlanta victory; Nadeau ran out of gas short of the finish and finished fifth. After eleven races in 2002, Nadeau was let go from the team.


==== Joe Nemechek (2002-2003) ====
Nadeau's replacement was Joe Nemechek, who had been released from Haas-Carter Motorsports after his team lost its sponsor Kmart due to bankruptcy and had spent much of the early part of the season substituting for an injured Johnny Benson, Jr. in the No. 10 car at MB2. Nemechek won at Richmond in 2003 but was let go before the end of the season so he could join MB2 Motorsports as the replacement for an injured Nadeau.


==== Brian Vickers (2003-2006) ====
Nemechek's replacement in the No. 25 was Brian Vickers, who was initially supposed to drive the car beginning in 2004 while racing full-time in the Busch Series in 2003 (where he won the championship). UAW and Delphi did not return as sponsors after 2003, so Hendrick replaced them with GMAC Financial (Vickers' primary sponsor in Busch) and sister company Ditech.com. In spite of high expectations, Vickers finished third in Rookie of the Year standings behind Kasey Kahne and Brendan Gaughan. 2004 was a sad year for Vickers and the No. 25 team. "Papa" Joe, long-time owner of the No. 25 car, died in July, while Vickers' close friend Ricky Hendrick (the more recent owner of the 25) perished in a plane crash that also took the lives of nine others in October. Vickers improved to seventeenth in points in 2005. Midway through the 2006 campaign, Vickers announced he would leave Hendrick Motorsports at the end of the season.


==== Casey Mears (2007) ====
On June 9, 2006 Hendrick Motorsports announced that Casey Mears of Chip Ganassi Racing would take the spot of Vickers in 2007. Vickers collected his first career win later that season at Talladega in a controversial finish, spinning out teammate Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. to take the victory.

In 2007, the Army National Guard joined forces with longtime Hendrick Motorsports partner GMAC to sponsor the No. 25 Chevrolet driven by Casey Mears. Mears piloted the No. 25 to his first career win at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the Coca-Cola 600. After the season, Mears moved to the No. 5, while the fourth full-time ride was given to the new No. 88 for Dale Earnhardt, Jr., who replaced Kyle Busch at Hendrick Motorsports. This left the No. 25 as a part-time team.


==== As a part-time team (2008-2015) ====
Making his Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series debut at Texas Motor Speedway in the 2008 Dickies 500, JR Motorsports driver Brad Keselowski started 37th and finished 19th in the No. 25 GoDaddy-sponsored Chevrolet. Keselowski would go on to make limited appearances in the No. 25 in both 2008 and 2009 with the intent of eventually taking over the team's No. 5 car. However, after Mark Martin re-signed to continue driving the No. 5 car in 2010, Keselowski replaced David Stremme in the No. 12 car for Penske Racing late in the 2009 season (the ride he had been offered at the beginning of the season), leaving the Hendrick organization.The No. 25 returned in 2011, being driven by Mark Martin in that year's Sprint All-Star Race while his usual No. 5 was being occupied by Jimmie Johnson. The Farmers Insurance Group-sponsored car sported a retro red paint scheme resembling the Budweiser and Folgers schemes run by the team in the 1980s and 1990s.In late 2014, it was announced that Nationwide Series Champion Chase Elliott would drive several races in a fifth Hendrick car in 2015, according to Hendrick Motorsports general manager Doug Duchardt. The car was officially announced as the No. 25 on January 29, 2015, and Elliott drove the car in five races with Xfinity Series sponsor NAPA Auto Parts, in preparation for taking over the No. 24 car in 2016.

=== Car No. 48 history ===

Jimmie Johnson (2001â€“present)The current No. 48 car, co-owned by Jeff Gordon and Rick Hendrick, began competing in 2001 when Hendrick signed Jimmie Johnson, a second-year Busch Series driver for Herzog-Jackson Motorsports. Johnson made his debut at the fall Charlotte race, qualifying fifteenth and finishing thirty-ninth after crashing out. Johnson competed in two other races that year before moving to the NASCAR Winston Cup Series circuit full-time in 2002. The No. 48 team was given all of the No. 24 team's old cars, while the No. 24 built all new cars for the 2002 season. Johnson won three races and finished runner-up to Ryan Newman in the rookie battle. During his first season, Johnson became the first rookie to ever lead the points standings. He finished fifth in final points in 2002. He won three more races in 2003 and finished second in points.
Johnson led much of the 2004 season point standing but suffered bad luck before the Chase for the Nextel Cup began, falling to second behind Jeff Gordon. After falling as far as ninth in points during the Chase, he rebounded with four wins in five races. Despite this, Johnson would lose the championship by only eight points to Kurt Busch in what was until 2011 the closest final championship margin in Cup history.
Johnson led the points for much of the 2005 season, but lost the points lead to Tony Stewart after the Brickyard 400 when he suffered a hard crash. He won four races and ultimately finished fifth in points that year. On February 19, 2006, Johnson won his first Daytona 500 while crew chief Chad Knaus was serving a four-race suspension for rules infractions. Johnson would go on to win the All-Star Challenge, Brickyard 400, and the 2006 Nextel Cup championship.
Johnson also won the 2007 Nextel Cup championship in a season that Hendrick Motorsports won 18 of 36 races, with Johnson winning a staggering 10 races, including taking four in a row during the Chase for the Cup.

In 2008, Johnson tied Cale Yarborough's record by winning his third consecutive championship. In 2009, Johnson won seven races, had 16 top fives, and 24 top tens to claim his fourth consecutive championship. He is the only driver in NASCAR history to ever win four cup championships in a row. In 2010, Johnson beat that record by winning his fifth championship in a row. He was in second at the start of the race, behind the Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota of Denny Hamlin. This is the first time since 2005, that he had to run a final race with him not in the lead of the points.
2011, statistically, was a disappointing season for the 48 team. Aside from using a push from Dale Earnhardt Jr. to beat Clint Bowyer at Talladega by just .002 seconds and a victory in the fall Kansas race, Johnson would finish sixth in the Chase, the first time he finished outside the top five in his career. 2012 fared better for Johnson, as he won races at Darlington, Dover, Indianapolis, Martinsville, and Texas, but were hampered by a crash at the fall Phoenix race as well as a broken drive shaft at Homestead, relegating them to third in points.
In 2013, Johnson won his second Daytona 500 and fourth All-Star Race on his way to his sixth championship. His 2014 season, however, was disappointing, as he finished 11th in the standings, marking the first time he failed to finish a season in the top 10. The 2015 season saw some improvement, as Johnson won five races and finished 10th in the standings, despite failing to advance past the round of 16.
Johnson won four races on his way to his seventh championship in 2016, tying Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt with the most NASCAR Cup championships of all time. The 2017 season, however, was mediocre, as he finished 10th in the standings.
Despite not winning a race throughout the 2018 season, Johnson made the Playoffs, his 15th straight appearance. At the inaugural Charlotte Roval race, Johnson was close to overtaking Martin Truex Jr. for the win, but he locked his brakes on turn 17 and spun out of control, taking Truex with him while Ryan Blaney passed them to cross the finish line. This resulted in Johnson being eliminated in the Round of 16 of the Playoffs. He went on to score only one more top-ten afterwards and finished the season 14th in the final points standings.
On March 14, 2018, Lowe's announced the end of their sponsorship of the No. 48 team after the 2018 season. On September 19, Hendrick Motorsports announced that the No. 48 will use the original 2002 Lowe's paint scheme in the season-ending race at Homestead-Miami. On October 10, it was announced that Kevin Meendering from JR Motorsports will become the No. 48 crew chief while Knaus moves to the No. 24 team in 2019. On October 28, 2018, Hendrick Motorsports announced that Ally Financial (formerly GMAC, which also sponsored Hendrick Motorsports in past seasons) signed a two-year deal to sponsor the No. 48 team starting in 2019.On July 29, 2019, following a string of disappointing finishes during the 2019 season, Hendrick Motorsports announced that race engineer Cliff Daniels will replace Meendering as the crew chief of the No. 48. Despite the change, Johnson failed to make the Playoffs for the first time since its inception in 2004, following a crash at Indianapolis after being on the Playoff bubble for most of the regular season. On October 4, 2019, Ally extended its sponsorship of the No. 48 for three more years through the 2023 season.He finished a career-worst 18th in the final points standings.

=== Car No. 88 history ===


==== Part Time (2002-2006) ====
The car debuted in 2002 as the No. 60 Haas Automation/NetZero Chevrolet, fielded jointly between Hendrick and Gene Haas in preparation for Haas to field his own team, Haas CNC Racing. Hendrick driver Jack Sprague attempted six races (qualifying for three) with a best finish of 30th at Homestead Miami Speedway. While Haas and Sprague moved over to the No. 0 Pontiac, the No. 60 returned as a Hendrick R&D car in 2003 with test driver David Green and continued sponsorship from Haas and NetZero. Green attempted the four restrictor plate races (missing the first Daytona and Talladega races) with a best finish of 32nd. Brian Vickers made his Cup Series debut at the fall Charlotte race, finishing 33rd, before moving to the 25 car. The 60 was entered at the Homestead-Miami season-finale with Kyle Busch and Ditech.com, but withdrew.
18-year-old Kyle Busch took over the car the following season, selecting the number 84 (reverse of No. 48) for the Carquest Chevy. He made his debut at his hometown track Las Vegas Motor Speedway and made five more starts that year with a best finish of twenty-fourth at California.
In 2005, Terry Labonte took over the car after he announced he became semi-retired; the number had been changed to No. 44, used by Labonte during his first championship season in 1984. Kyle Busch, meanwhile, moved to his No. 5 car full-time. Sponsored by Kellogg's, Pizza Hut, and GMAC/Ditech.com, Labonte drove the car in a limited schedule over the next two years. His final race with the team was at his native Texas Motor Speedway in November 2006, in a special commemorative paint scheme sponsored by longtime-partner Kellogg's. Though Labonte planned to retire following the race, he would race on a part-time or substitute basis until 2014.

On June 13, 2007, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. announced he would join Hendrick Motorsports for the 2008 season. On September 14, 2007 it was announced that he would drive the No. 88 car, after a deal with Robert Yates Racing that sent the No. 88 car to Hendrick Motorsports. The No. 88 replaced the No. 25, which scaled back to part-time. AMP Energy (owned by longtime Hendrick sponsor PepsiCo) and the National Guard (which had sponsored the No. 25) stepped up to sponsor the car. Earnhardt, Jr.'s crew chief and cousin, Tony Eury, Jr., also made the move to Hendrick Motorsports. However, this partnership only lasted until April 2009 when Tony Eury, Jr. was replaced by Lance McGrew, a technical advisor and part-time crew chief with HMS for the No. 25 car.
At the start of the 2011 season, Steve Letarte moved over from Jeff Gordon's team and became Earnhardt's crew chief. For 2012, PepsiCo decided to replace the struggling AMP Energy brand with the Diet Mountain Dew brand. The team won for the first time since 2008 and for the second consecutive year made the Chase, but Earnhardt suffered a concussion during an August Hollywood Casino 400 tire testing on the reconfigured Kansas Speedway, and was not tested for the concussion until the Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500 at Talladega, where he was involved in a second hard crash. After testing, Earnhardt was deemed medically unfit to race. Regan Smith, scheduled to drive for Phoenix Racing, instead drove the No. 88 at Charlotte and Kansas in what turned out to be a tryout that led to Smith joining Earnhardt's Xfinity team for 2013. Earnhardt returned at Martinsville and finished out the season.

Earnhardt finished fifth in Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series points in 2013, after winning two poles (at Kentucky Speedway and Dover International Speedway), and posting five-second-place finishes.
The No. 88 returned to prominence in 2014 when Earnhardt won four races â€“ the Daytona 500, both Pocono races, and the fall Martinsville race. Letarte joined NASCAR on NBC in 2015, and JR Motorsports crew chief Greg Ives was hired to replace him. On August 6 of that year, the National Guard decided not to renew their sponsorship with Earnhardt. They would be replaced by Nationwide Insurance, outgoing sponsor of the now-Xfinity Series and longtime sponsor of Earnhardt, for the 2015 season.
Late in 2015, it was announced that Axalta Coating Systems, longtime sponsor of Hendrick's No. 24, would move to sponsor the No. 88 in 2016.In 2016, concussion-like symptoms ended Earnhardt's season after Kentucky. His replacements were Alex Bowman and Jeff Gordon. 2017 marked Earnhardt Jr.'s final full-time season in Hendrick's No. 88 as he announced his retirement in April of that year.


==== Alex Bowman (2018-present) ====
It was announced on July 20, 2017 that Bowman would take over the No. 88 car for the 2018 season. Despite being winless, Bowman made the Playoffs until he was eliminated from the Round of 12 at the fall Kansas race.
The 2019 season saw improvement in Bowman's finishes, including three consecutive second-place finishes at Talladega, Dover, and Kansas. Bowman also made the starting grid of the 2019 Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race by winning the Fan Vote. It was announced on June 12, 2019, that Nationwide Insurance would not be sponsoring Hendrick Motorsports or the No. 88 after 2019, ending a five-year relationship prematurely. At the 2019 Camping World 400 at Chicagoland Speedway, Bowman held off a late charge from Kyle Larson to win his first career NASCAR Cup race.On June 13, 2019, Nationwide Insurance announced the end of their five-year sponsorship of the No. 88 after the 2019 season. On September 20, tool company Cincinnati Inc. signed a 10-year partnership deal with HMS, including primary sponsorship of the No. 88.He went to get eliminated after the Round Of 12 in the playoffs and finished 12th in the standings with one win which is an improvement for the 88 after 2 seasons.

=== Other car history ===
In 1987, Benny Parsons drove for Hendrick's second team as a replacement for Tim Richmond. Hendrick kept the No. 25 available for Richmond to run a limited schedule, so Parsons drove the No. 35 car instead with Richmond's crew chief Harry Hyde. Parsons opened the year with a second-place finish at the Daytona 500. Parsons ended up running the entire season, with the team temporarily expanding to four teams when Richmond returned for eight races, and finished sixteenth in points with six top-fives and nine top-tens.In 1993, Hendrick fielded a car numbered 46 for two races. The first race was that year's Daytona 500 as Al Unser, Jr. qualified for his only career NASCAR race in a Valvoline-sponsored car (Valvoline being his then-primary sponsor in the IndyCar Series). The second saw Buddy Baker fail to qualify a DuPont-sponsored car at Talladega in the spring.In 1995, Hendrick fielded the No. 58 Racing for a Reason Chevrolet. The sponsor is a leukemia marrow sponsor founded by Rick Hendrick. The car was entered originally a safety car for Jeff Gordon to clinch his first championship. The No. 58 was driven by Jeff Purvis, as Gordon had to finish 41st or better in the 42 car field. Gordon clinched the championship by staying out on green flag pit stops. Purvis came in 26th place. The No. 58 would not return until 2001 as the No. 48 car.


==== Days of Thunder cars ====

In 1989 and 1990, Hendrick Motorsports served as a technical consultant during the filming of Days of Thunder, including providing camera-equipped racecars to capture racing footage. The team prepared a total of 14 racecars for the filming. In-race footage was taken at the 1989 Autoworks 500 at Phoenix International Raceway, and the 1990 Daytona 500, in addition to stunt footage shot outside of NASCAR events. At each race, the cars would run 100 miles before start-and-parking. At Phoenix, Hendrick qualified two movie cars: the No. 46 City Chevrolet Lumina driven by Greg Sacks, and the No. 51 Exxon Lumina driven by Bobby Hamilton. An additional car, the No. 18 Hardee's Lumina driven by Tommy Ellis, failed to qualify. Though the cars were not intended to run competitively, Hamilton qualified fifth and led five laps before pulling off the track. Sacks would run the 46 in the Busch Clash exhibition race at Daytona in early 1990, finishing second in one of the movie cars. After the incident at Phoenix, the two cars fielded at the Daytona 500 with Ellis (No. 18 Hardee's Lumina) and Hamilton (No. 51 Mello Yello Lumina) were not officially scored.Following the production of the film, Sacks continued to drive for Hendrick's research and development team on a part-time basis in 1990. Sacks attempted two races (1 DNQ) in the No. 46, twelve in the No. 18 with sponsorship from Ultra Slim Fast, and three in the No. 17 as a substitute for Darrell Waltrip. Sacks earned a second-place finish at Talladega in May, and a pole at Daytona in July. The team was shut down and Sacks released at the end of the year, due to Slim Fast ending its sponsorship.

In his rookie year, he won five races and was runner-up to Martin Truex, Jr. in points. He moved up to Cup as well after the season, but he continued to drive the 5 part-time. Mexican driver Adrian FernÃ¡ndez drove the car in six races in 2005, finishing tenth at Mexico City, but did not have another top-ten finish that season. Hendrick development drivers Blake Feese, Boston Reid, and Kyle Krisiloff also drove the car, running a total of eighteen races with best finishes of twenty-third, seventeenth, and nineteenth, respectively.

This car was sponsored by Lowe's, Delphi, the National Guard, and GoDaddy.com.In 2009, the No. 5 car would be reduced to a part-time schedule due to the lack of sponsorship. Fastenal, Unilever and GoDaddy.com would sponsor the car with Cassill, Truex, Jr., Earnhardt, Jr., Martin, Tony Stewart, Ryan Newman and Scott Wimmer also drove the car. The car would remain inactive save for limited appearances by Dale Jr.

He performed his mandatory military service in the Imperial German Army between 1908 and 1910, serving with the 4th Guards Grenadier Regiment.When World War I broke out in 1914, Kampe was recalled to service; he joined the 5th Guards Regiment. He transferred to Die Fliegertruppe (the flying troops) in 1915. He first flew with Flieger-Abteilung (Flier Detachment) 35, before transferring to a fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 8 for a short spell.

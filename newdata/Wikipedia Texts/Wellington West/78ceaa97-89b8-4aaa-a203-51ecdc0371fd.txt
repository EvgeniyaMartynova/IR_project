Wellington West Coast and Taranaki Regiment

The Wellington West Coast and Taranaki Regiment was a Territorial Force unit of the New Zealand Army. It was originally formed in 1948 by the amalgamation of two separate regiments:

Wellington West Coast Regiment (previously the 7th (Wellington West Coast Rifles) Regiment)
Taranaki Regiment  (previously the 11th (Taranaki Rifles) Regiment)The regiment became a TF battalion of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment in 1964 during the reorganisation of the army. This was until the later reorganisation of 1999, which saw the TF battalions split from the RNZIR to become multi-function battalion groups. The Wellington, West Coast and Taranaki Regiment became the 5th Wellington, West Coast and Taranaki Battalion Group, with the following unit types:

Engineers – 1 Field Squadron, RNZE

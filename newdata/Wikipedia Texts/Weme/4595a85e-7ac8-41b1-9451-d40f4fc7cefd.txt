In 1999, the department of Plateau was split off from Ouémé, reducing Ouémé's area to 1,865 square kilometres (720 sq mi). Ouémé is subdivided into nine communes, each centered at one of the principal towns: Adjarra, Adjohoun, Aguégués, Akpro-Missérété, Avrankou, Bonou, Dangbo, Porto-Novo and Sèmè-Kpodji.Benin, formerly known as Dahomey, was a French colony till 1894. It gained independence in 1960 and was admitted to the United Nations. The period from 1960 to 1972 was marked by political instability and frequent changes of leadership. Benin originally had six administrative regions (départements), which have now been bifurcated to make 12. Each of the deconcentrated administrative services (directions départementales) of the sectoral ministries takes care of two administrative regions. A law passed in 1999 transformed the sous-prefectures, the lowest level of territorial administration, into local governments. Municipalities and communal councils have elected representatives who manage the administration of the regions. The latest elections of the municipal and communal councils were held in June 2015.

Parkfield High School

Parkfield High School was a secondary school located in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England.
Opened in April 1962, it was situated in the Parkfield area of the which has been administratively part of Wolverhampton since 1966, having previous been on the northern edge of the Urban District of Coseley.  The school served the neighbourhoods of Lanesfield, Woodcross and Ettingshall. It was built during the 1960s, with extensions following during the 1970s, and around 1980 the main building was extensively renovated due to mining subsidence.  The school replaced the former Manor Secondary School near Woodcross, Coseley.
The last headmaster before the change into the "South Wolverhampton and Bilston Academy" was Mr Arthur Thompson, who retired in July 2009. The two sites which Parkfields maintained joined together on the Wolverhampton Road East site from September 2009.

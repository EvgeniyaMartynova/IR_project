== Early life and amateur career ==
Goldschmidt was born in Wilmington, Delaware. He grew up a Houston Astros fan. His parents, David and Kim, met at the Rochester Institute of Technology. His mother is Catholic and his father is Jewish. Goldschmidt and his two younger brothers were raised Catholic. His Jewish great-grandparents Paul and Ilse Goldschmidt and his grandfather, Ernie (who now lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida), escaped Nazi Germany in 1938 before the Holocaust. Goldschmidt said he and his two brothers "know our Jewish history and we respect those beliefs. We had both sides of it as kids. My dad's side, my mom's side. We were exposed to all of it." The Goldschmidt family moved from Wilmington to Dallas, and then to Houston, because of the flooring company his family owns. He grew up in The Woodlands, Texas, and attended The Woodlands High School and played for their baseball team. They won the state championship in 2006, with Goldschmidt playing as the team's third baseman.The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Goldschmidt in the 49th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft.

He enrolled at Texas State University to play college baseball for the Texas State Bobcats baseball team. He was named the Southland Conference hitter of the year in 2008 and 2009, Southland player of the year in 2009, and was a third-team All-American as a junior in 2009 after hitting .352 with 18 home runs and 88 runs batted in (RBIs) in 57 games played.

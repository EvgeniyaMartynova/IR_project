== Reception ==
Scott Yanow of Allmusic called it an "underrated set ...well worth searching for". On Jazz History Online, Michael Verity observed "By 1973, when he recorded Soaring, a 10-cut musical haiku, all of his interests were converging into a style that was bold, intensely rhythmic and perfectly calibrated sound for the big screen. (It should be no surprise he was scoring The French Connection at same time he was working on this project)."

Movement for Change and Prosperity

The Movement for Change and Prosperity (MCAP) is a political party in Montserrat.


== History ==
The party was established in 2005 as a successor to the National Progressive Party. In the 2006 elections it received 36.1% of the vote, winning four seats. Although it was the largest party in the Legislative Council, a coalition government was formed by the Montserrat Democratic Party (MDP), the New People's Liberation Movement (NPLM) and an independent MP.
In the 2009 elections the MCAP won six of the nine seats, with its then leader Reuben Meade becoming Chief Minister. However, the 2014 elections saw the party reduced to two seats.

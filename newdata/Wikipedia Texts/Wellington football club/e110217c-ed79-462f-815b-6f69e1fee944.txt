=== Wellington Diamond United ===
Wellington Diamond United was the result of the merger of Diamond and Zealandia/Wellington United in 1968.
Diamond was founded as a junior football club in 1893 by members of the Star Rugby Club, who wished to play football. It became a senior team in 1895. 
Zealandia was founded in 1954 by Dutch immigrants, changing its name to Wellington United in 1964.
In 1968 the club played in the Central Region's Division One, finishing fourth out ten. The club made it to the National League for the 1973 season but at the end of the following season they found themselves back in Division One.
Wellington Diamond United won the National League in 1976, 1981 and 1985.

Hungaria was formed in 1962 by Hungarian immigrants. The club played in the Central Region league before being invited to join the first New Zealand National Soccer League in 1970. The team finished seventh out of eight that season, winning just three games. It was the club's only season in the National League as they forfeited their place to form a composite entry with Miramar Rangers, to be known as Wellington City, for the 1971 and 1972 seasons. Miramar withdrew after the 1971 season.
In 1973 the club went solo again, this time in Division Two of the Central League (finishing second) with Wellington City as an independent entity. The following season the club topped the table, winning promotion to Division One.

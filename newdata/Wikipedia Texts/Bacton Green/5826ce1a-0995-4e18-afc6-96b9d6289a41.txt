Bacton is known for its very quiet sandy beaches offering miles of walking along the beach and cliffs. The England Coast Path passes through the village and also the Paston Way long distance footpath linking Cromer and North Walsham.

During the First World War there was also an airfield located nearby, RAF Bacton.


== Coastal erosion ==
The village and adjoining coastline has extensive sea defences, erected to prevent coastal erosion. Part of this sea wall in nearby Walcott, Norfolk was damaged in the storm surge in December 2013, which caused damage to several caravans and chalets.
North of Bacton lies the village of Paston where the Bacton Gas Terminal is located. In July 2019 a scheme commenced to deposit almost two million cubic metres of sand, forming a 6-kilometre (4 mi) artificial dune. Costing Â£20 million, the scheme will protect the gas terminal, as well as the villages of Bacton and Walcott. The sea defences are expected to protect the area for between 15 and 20 years.

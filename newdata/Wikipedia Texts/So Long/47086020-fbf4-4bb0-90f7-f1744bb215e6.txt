Lost and Gone Forever

Lost and Gone Forever is the third studio album by the band Guster, released in September 1999. It was recorded earlier that year in Sausalito, California, and Bearsville, New York. In 1999, Ryan Miller claimed that Guster took the album's title "from the popular folk song 'Oh My Darling, Clementine'" and "chose it because we felt it reflected the lyrical content of the record."In February 2012, Paste magazine named Lost and Gone Forever the 79th greatest album of the 1990s.

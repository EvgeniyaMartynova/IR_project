Off Broadway (band)

Off Broadway USA is an American rock band founded by Paul Darrow, Cliff Johnson, Paul McDermott, John Pazdan and Dan Santercola in 1977 in Oak Park, Illinois. After several line-up changes including the addition of songwriter/guitarist John Ivan and Robert Harding, the band's debut album On was released by Atlantic Records in 1979.  The album reached No. 101 on the Billboard 200 and spawned the single "Stay in Time", which reached No. 51 on the Billboard Hot 100 record charts. Off Broadway released a follow-up album, Quick Turns, on Atlantic Records in 1980 and continued touring for three years before breaking up in 1983.
In early May 1980, "Stay in Time" peaked at number 9 on the weekly music surveys of their hometown radio superstation WLS-AM in Chicago, which gave the song much airplay. The band is currently consists of all original "ON" album players: John Pazdan (bass guitar/backing vocals), John Ivan (guitar), Cliff Johnson (lead vocals), Ken Harck (drums), and Rob Harding (guitar/backing vocals).

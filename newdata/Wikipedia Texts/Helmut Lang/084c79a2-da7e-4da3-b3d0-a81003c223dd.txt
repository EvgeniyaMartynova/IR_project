Helmut Lang (artist)

Helmut Lang (born 10 March 1956) is an Austrian artist and former fashion designer who lives and works in New York and on Long Island.


== Career ==
In 1984, Lang closed the shop and two years later showed his first Helmut Lang runway collection in Paris at Centre Georges Pompidou. He showed the first Helmut Lang Men's collection in 1987. In 1997 he moved his label from Vienna to New York.Lang used unconventional materials such as rubber, feathers and metallic fabrics and redefined the silhouette of the 1990s and early 2000s. He broke away from the runway show-as-spectacle in the height of the 1980s opulence and was the first to stream his collection online.Lang's brand was known for its utilitarian, minimalist aesthetic, as well as for its prestige range of denim, for which he charged for a premium in the 1990s.In 1999, Lang sold a 51% stake in his company to the Prada Group, with Prada running distribution and manufacturing and Lang controlling design and advertising. Afterwards, Prada developed a line of Helmut Lang accessories such as shoes, belts and bags, and opened Helmut Lang stores in Hong Kong and Singapore. Sales under the Prada Group fell from $100 million in 1999  to $37 million in 2003. The brand's decision to cancel the licensing for an external company to manufacture and market its profitable range of Helmut Lang Jeans was cited as one of the reasons for its loss in revenue. In 2005 he left his label and retired from fashion. He has since been based in Long Island. In 2006, Prada sold the Helmut Lang brand to Link Theory Holdings.Lang had collaborated with artists Jenny Holzer and Louise Bourgeois. His recent works explore abstract sculptural forms and physical arrangements and space beyond the limitations of the human body. Lang had his first solo art exhibition ALLES GLEICH SCHWER at the Kestnergesellschaft in Hannover in 2008. Lang has published excerpts from his ongoing art projects Long Island Diaries [13] and The Selective Memory Series [14] in a number of publications, such as BUTT Magazine [15], Fannzine 137 [16], Visionaire and most recently The Travel Almanac [17].

Dutton–Small House (page does not exist)

Dutton Speedwords, transcribed in Speedwords as Dutton Motez, is an international auxiliary language as well as an abbreviated writing system using the English alphabet for all the languages of the world. It was devised by Reginald J. G. Dutton (born 8 November 1886 in Nottingham, UK; died 23 June 1970, Skegness, UK) who initially ran a shorthand college promoting Dutton Shorthand (a geometric script), then offered a mail order (correspondence) self-education course in Speedwords while still supporting the Dutton Shorthand. The business was continued by his daughter Elizabeth after his death. The widest awareness of his method occurred from 1951 to 1975 though sales of his book in the Teach Yourself series (published by Hodder) called 'Dutton Speedwords' (hereafter abbreviated TYDS). In it, Dutton claimed that Speedwords was "the first abbreviated writing invention in history which at once transcribes all languages" (page 8). After Dutton's death in 1970, Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords was issued in a revised edition (1971). It is not clear whether this was completed by Reginald before his death or by Elizabeth in the aftermath. However, it was not a major update of the vocabulary, rules, or pronunciation.


== Requirements for communication ==
Any transcription, note taking or correspondence system must fulfil six requirements (Oliver, 2019, Micro-intellectual capital: A case study of Dutton Speedwords):

1. Rules for ensuring an agreed vocabulary, how additions are included, and, how technical terms are expressed
2. Systematic method for representing the vocabulary including abbreviations or contractions or truncations, particularly where literal transcription is necessary
3. A pronunciation system that makes the vocalisation meaningful
4. A meaningful word order
5. Rule for designating or rejecting parts of speech
6. A method for learning the new system of communicationIdeally these requirements should not be wholly biased toward English but consider European, Asian and Middle East languages.
The system of Speedwords created over 50 years by Dutton addresses all these requirements. Other systems have copied the solutions devised by Dutton without greatly improving his approach. One major advantage of Dutton's Speedwords is that it is readily available to everyone. Its current competitors either require pre-payment for materials before revealing the full details of their system, or have only developed a subset of the words for their system.


== Objectives of Speedwords ==
Over time, three objectives were claimed by Dutton for Speedwords:
Initially, Dutton proposed Speedwords as an International Auxiliary Language (often abbreviated IAL) to encourage people to communicate internationally. Dutton wanted to provide a system so that a sender could use which did not require them to learn the (foreign) language used by the recipient before establishing communication. Speedwords achieves this by relying on a deliberately small vocabulary. For international communication, the writer and reader are different, so, it is important that communication is unambiguous.
Then Dutton promoted Speedwords for high-speed writing. This used ideas and experience based on Dutton Shorthand. Dutton developed this stenographic method between 1919 and 1926. This approach also assumed that the writer and reader were different.
Up to this time, Speedwords treated synonyms as equivalent. These synonyms are different to alternative parts of speech which are already covered by either variants of the same English word (e.g., 'hon' refers to sincere, sincerely, sincerity), or the same Speedword covered several different English words (e.g., 'kla' means class, kind, or sort. There are also derivatives of Speedwords (e.g., 'bi' means life but there is also 'bie' lively, bik vital, 'bir' creature, 'biu' welfare, 'biv' spirit, 'bix' death, 'bixk' fatal, 'bixy' kill, 'bixya' murder. 
Later, realising that some writing required literal transcription, Dutton expanded the vocabulary to allow words which are synonyms which were required to precisely distinguish shades of meaning. Dutton offered two methods to distinguish these synonyms which were required for literal transcription. The first was to use an initial capital letter. The capital letter indicates the Speedword is being used to denote a specific word not the range of words covered by a Speedword. These were officially recognised by being listed in the Speedwords Dictionary. The second method was to underline the Speedword. Dutton does not detail how this would work so it is assumed that this was left to the discretion of the Speedwords user.
Finally, Dutton promoted Speedwords for individual (personal) note writing and note reading. This approach assumed that the writer and reader were mostly the same person. Dutton encouraged this group of users to adopt some personal conventions to adapt it to their personal needs (e.g., underlining). The widely available "Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords" (original 1951 edition and revised 1971 edition, but paragraph 4 in both editions) was focused on the note taking and note making objective although Dutton still claimed it could also be used to fulfil the other objectives.


== How can Speedwords be used? ==
There are three possible uses: writing, speaking including dictation, and, note taking


=== Writing ===
This was the original use intended by Dutton. Speedwords would allow peoples with different national languages to communicate using Speedwords as the medium. This would be accomplished because it had a compact vocabulary and rigid meanings to avoid ambiguity. All versions of Speedwords were customised for writing and minimising the number of letters that had to be written.


=== Speaking including dictation ===
Criticisms in 1935-6 of the predecessor of Speedwords (called International 2 Letter Script which had many combinations of consonants) were focused on the difficulty in pronouncing strings of consonants. Speedwords overcame this deficiency.


=== Note taking ===
Teach yourself Speedwords" adapted Speedwords to note taking. It added a method for recognising alternative synonyms (by capitalising the first letter). It anticipated where there may be overlap with existing Speedwords if two separate Speedwords were joined together to facilitate high speed writing (which required the pen to remain on the paper/page).


== Competitors to Speedwords ==
There are three competitors to Speedwords. They are (1) shorthand as simplified letterforms, (2) shorthand as picture symbols, and, (3) shorthand using non-stenographic systems (that is, alphabetic characters).
Simplified letterforms are also called stenographic shorthand systems. One type of letterform geometric which are based on circles, parts of circles, and straight lines placed strictly horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The most popular example is Pitman shorthand released 1837, and many lesser-known systems such as Boyd's syllabic shorthand originally published 1903, as well as predecessor systems such as Duployan Shorthand. These use symbols which do not represent letters, but rather sounds so the words are written more or less as they are spoken. Contrasted with geometric are script shorthands which are oriented around the movement of the hand when writing. The original is Gabelsberger shorthand which began in Grmany and spread through Europe. Script-geometric, or semi-script, shorthands are a hybrid of geometric systems and the script systems. The notable example is Gregg shorthand first published in 1888. Other examples include Superwrite, Easyscript, Keyscript, Speedwriting, Quickscript]], Breviogrph, Stenoscript ABC, and Teeline.
Picture symbols were proposed by Austrian Charles K. Bliss (1897–1985) who created Blissymbolics in 1949 as a universal written language for speakers of any language to learn and communicate. It avoided the problems of constructed quasi-European language like Esperanto, or, natural languages such as English. Blissymbolics was conceived as a purely visual, speech-less language but provided a basic vocabulary that could be spoken.
Non-stenographic systems or alphabetic systems may also supplement the alphabetic characters by using punctuation marks as additional characters, give different meanings when letters are capitalised, or add non-alphabetic symbols. The most popular of these is Esperanto. Dutton contrasted Speedwords with its major rival Esperanto by claiming correctly that Speedwords had a smaller vocabulary and did not require the extensive study that was required to converse or write Esperanto. Another rapid writing system with a similar name, Speedwriting (also called Brief English Systems) was invented by Emma Dearborn at Simmons College, Columbia University and published in 1925. Her method used letters of the alphabet and some punctuation marks to represent the sounds of English which could be reproduced on the typewriter. Dearborn initially franchised teaching and then sold the rights which passed between various companies who made further changes and marketed it throughout USA and in various languages (e.g., Spanish). Other methods included Personal Shorthand also known as Briefscript, and Keyscript. Forkner Shorthand was promoted as an alternative to Pitman shorthand from 1955-1995 but is no longer taught.
The benchmark for pronunciation is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) produced by the International Phonetic Association. It is easily printable by hand or keyboard although its conventions are often not used to depict pronunciation in dictionaries and other reference materials.
The major reason that Dutton Speedwords continues to receive attention is its strict alphabetical constraint that allows it to be used on a keyboard, and its breadth of practical application which Dutton embodied in his system. Although Forkner shorthand and some other systems emphasised replacing some longhand writing with shortcuts as soon as they begin studying the system, and achieving dictation rates above 50 words per minute, they have learning times of a year or more. Dutton Speedwords is around a week to a fortnight.


== Design of Speedwords ==
The design of Speedwords has four features:

1. Unlike other shorthand methods, (e.g., Pitman, Gregg) which use new symbols, strokes or geometric shapes, Speedwords method uses the 26 letters of the English alphabet (upper and lower case) plus the ampersand symbol ('&').
2. Unlike most other shorthand methods, and rapid writing methods, Speedwords has its roots in a shorthand system which Dutton found cumbersome and which he believed he overcome by using alphabetic characters.
3. Unlike other shorthand and rapid writing systems, Dutton emphasised the speed of learning.
4. Like other shorthand systems, Dutton sought to maximise speed and minimise the amount of writing.


== Principles of Speedwords ==
In all publications, Dutton describes various principles of Speedwords but there is no consolidated list of principles. They can be summarised as:

1. Select its vocabulary from the entire Indo-European language family, particularly maximising the internationality of words, that is, selecting a word that is common between languages, (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 90).
2. Abbreviate those words guided by a 1925 analysis by Horn on the frequency of words. The most frequently used words were allocated the shorted abbreviation. So the most frequent words have just one letter (Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 5).
3. Make one Speedword have only one meaning which results in a basic vocabulary which Dutton calls 'keywords' (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 7).
4. Avoid grammatical differences, so a keyword can also refer to noun, verb, adjective, adverb (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 5).
5. Create other meanings by adding suffixes to show relationships or create antonyms (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 3).While this approach is sound it has both advantages and a few disadvantages discussed below.
Speedwords was meant to be written and spoken, so Dutton provided some guidelines on pronunciation which is included below.


== Advantages ==
In Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords, Dutton claims at least eight benefits from Speedwords:

1. Knowing just a few Speedwords (he means the one letter Speedwords) allows immediate savings in time and effort (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords 1951, page 7). This the words can be substituted for the English equivalents as the Speedwords vocabulary is learnt. This contrasts with geometric shorthand shapes which requires the entire system to be mastered.
2. It uses the English alphabet. This means it Speedwords can be written or typed (TYDS, page 8).
3. It uses a range of Indo-European words. So, its vocabulary has an "international currency" (page 87).
4. Speedwords are chosen based on frequency of usage. This means that the most frequently used words are the shortest (TYDS, page 7).
5. Correspondence can be exchanged although the individual writers without having to learn the foreign language of all their many correspondents. This means the writers can be ignorant of the language of their correspondent (TYDS, page 8).
6. Knowing speed words takes between 20 and 30 hours (TYDS, pages 9, 90). The work of learning "is a fascinating pastime and in no sense an arduous task" (TYDS, page 9)
7. Speedwords makes 5 out of 6 words far shorter (page 87). This increases the speed of writing and note taking approximately 100-120 words per minute (page 137) or up to 150 wpm (page 8).
8. The 'hurdle' to overcome language barriers is considerably reduced because the Speedwords vocabulary is small. The basic vocabulary is 493 words (page 89). The more extensive vocabulary is 1,000 words (page 142)


== Disadvantages ==
The disadvantages appear to be:

1. No-one is developing Speedwords so authoritative information about it is now hard to find except for the Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords book. Some have taken Speedwords and adapted it. For example, see Briefscript by Ray Brown at http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/index.html
2. The Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords book does not have a full discussion of pronunciation which Dutton suggests is essential to using Speedwords. Hearsay is that Dutton had a simplified pronunciation system which may have been shared with some inquirers after his death, but it was never published
3. Dutton did not disclose the rules he used to formulate Speedwords so some apparent anomalies and obscurities exist. So, Dutton appears to make arbitrary decisions on the choice of a Speedword. For example, on page 25 Dutton states that 'ao' means 'away' although 'ax' would be logical. However, 'ax' has already been used to mean 'ask'. This shows that over 50 years Dutton had not reached 100% perfection of his system. This is consistent with the effort required to be expended to fully complete as shown by the Pareto Principle. Also, on TYDS, page 25 Dutton used the Speedword 'dy' for since but gives the rationale French 'depusis' but it does not contain 'y' and in French could also translate to 'for' which has the Speedword 'f'.
4. Some guidelines stated in Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords book are difficult to apply. For example, Dutton allows the reader to use synonyms for the basic Speedwords and distinguishes them from the basic speedwords by capitalising their first letter. Also, for example, English 'at' becomes the Speedword 'A' because Speedword 'a' means 'to' (TYDS, page72). Dutton says the reader can create her or his own supplementary list but does not detail how this is done or how she or he manages it.None of these disadvantages prevent its successful use for personal note taking.


== Achievements of Dutton ==
Dutton Speedwords continues to be referred to despite its orphan status because of his achievements:

1. He preferred to keep the vocabulary compact using frequency of use as the criteria.
2. He provided a proven learning approach (incremental learning with repetition) which makes it easy to master.
3. He persevered with it over a long period (1933-1970) so it was refined with experience and feedback.


== Evolution of speedwords ==
It appears that Speedwords developed in five main stages:

1. As a competitor to Pitman and Gregg shorthand. Based on the available Dutton shorthand publications held in libraries this occurred 1919-1925. At this point it was a geometric shorthand method which competed with Pitman and Gregg shorthand methods and did not use the English alphabet.
2. Under the influence of Horn's frequently used words list, an early attempt was made to develop an alternate international abbreviated language. Dutton expressed this in his one-page sheet called International 2-letter correspondence symbols (published 1933).
3. Further development occurred to create an alternate international language. It began in 1935 when International 2-letter correspondence symbols was revised and reissued in 1935 as International Symbolic Script. Another version called Word Speedwords was published between 1941-1945 (page 18 of Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords). There is a booklet of the same name published in 1946 which appears to contain 100 Speedwords. Despite attempts by Dutton to popularise World Speedwords it was not adopted as an international language. The intention expressed on page 88 in Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords (1951) to produce language-specific versions of the Speedwords course, did not eventuate. It appears another variation called Dutton Youth Speedwords was published in 1943. Both World Speedwords and Speedwords used words from Flemish (Dutch), French, German, Greek, Latin, Portuguese, Scandinavia, Slav, and Spanish are sources for both World Speedwords and Speedwords (According to pages 8, and 88 of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951 and 1971).
4. By 1946 it had been renamed Speedwords. By 1951 Dutton conceded that Speedwords was ideal for individual note taking and note making (page 7 Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords) and made some variations to Word Speedwords to adapt it for the new purpose (page 8 Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords). His audience is therefore students and time-poor people seeking to make the best use of their time, or people who incur high costs in communication. He comments that he hopes that "the student who has worked through the present course will look to this wide horizon (page 88) that is, international communication so Dutton always maintained his duality of objectives and functions.
5. It has been revived from time to time in its own right as well as with adaptations. The Dutton Society (no longer extant) promoted Speedwords. Some time management writers and computer specialists who describe online applications including e-mail and situations where communication is either slow or expensive.


== Sources describing Dutton Speedwords ==
There are three main sources of information about Speedwords: (1) Speedwords publications issued by Dutton, (2) the Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book in the Teach Yourself series and (3) third party publications and commentaries (see the references).
All the Dutton Speedwords booklets published between 1933 and 1951 are out of print. Very few libraries show holdings of copies.Helpful booklets used in preparing this page were the Speedwords dictionary. It consists of 4,000 basic and with derivatives 10,000 English-Speedword and Speedword-English words. 
A more accessible version focused on note taking and note making called Dutton Speedwords was published in 1951 in the Teach yourself series published by English Universities Press as a hardcover. It was reprinted in 1959 and 1962 (with the distinctive yellow dustjacket for both years). A revised edition was published in 1971. It was reissued in 1973 as a paperback. The only revisions made in 1971 were in Part 1 of the high-speed vocabulary appendix (pages 137-147). Part 2 of the High-Speed appendix which is aimed solely at English speakers was unchanged between the original 1951 and revised 1971 editions. Copies of the 1951 and 1971 editions are relatively easy to find second hand. The 1951 edition and its 1962 reprint are printed on higher quality paper than the updated 1971/1973 edition which has yellowed pages which easily tear. Both editions have misprints. This is an incomplete list:

1. Paragraph number 83 occurs twice: once in Lesson 8, and, also in the High-Speed Appendix.
2. Lists in Speedwords are frequently not in alphabetical order: for example, 'fon' and 'for' in the Alphabetic Speedwords list is out of order (page 94).The references below list some third-party publications and commentaries that are still available. Many other webpages have been lost and are no longer available. These missing webpages included the Dutton Society, the Robert Petry pages when he was promoting Speedwords in approximately 1997, and pages by the New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z. who promised a new reised edition of Dutton's Speedwords. However, there is no record of a library holding the reissued publication by New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z.


== Timeline of Speedwords ==
Dutton was assiduous in developing Speedwords and its predecessor Dutton shorthand. After developing Dutton shorthand, Dutton continued to improve it. But then realising the shortcomings of using shorthand, Dutton develops Dutton Shorthand. Dutton Shorthand was also revised many times. Dutton never gave up refining Speedwords, advocating its merits, and offering it for sale and as a correspondence course.
Below is a selection of publications that Dutton produced over his lifetime.

== Hints for learning and using Speedwords ==
Speedwords was taught as a correspondence course by both Dutton and his daughter in the pre and post-war period. Their course was supported by an extensive array of booklets which he had developed. Many of the booklets are listed in the timeline section. The option of enrolling in a course offered directly by Dutton's organisation or third parties is no longer available.
Some websites provide summaries of Speedwords (that is, the one and two letter Speedwords). Some websites provide illustrations or highlights of the method. They are not recommended because they either mis-state Dutton or are incomplete. The chief characteristic of Dutton Speedwords is its detail and the extensie guidelines Dutton provides in his booklets.
A few lucky people may be able to read some of the booklets Dutton published between 1940-1951. The booklets promote the other booklets which were avialble but do not explain their interrelationship. So this is a brief description on how to use them. Essentially there are four interrelated booklets. All four are required. They are: (1) The "textbook". (2) The "companion". It provides additional exercises and the answers to exercises in the textbook. (3) The "supplement". It provides further exercises with answers to enhance learning through additional practice (4) The bi-lingual vocabulary. This is an alphabetic list of Speedwords (between 3,00 and 10,000 depending upon the edition) with their English equialent, as well as an English-to-Speedwords lookup list. The vocabulary contains an introductory commentary by Dutton which is valuable for understanding and using the dictionary. Depending upon when they were published, they may be called "Dutton Speedwords, "Dutton Double Speedwords", "Duttom Youth Speedwords" or "Dutton World Speeedwords". They were published at different times with different titles and contain minor differences. There is usually more than one edition of each. The later editions (1946 or preferably 1951) are the most complete and up-to-date.
The most common authoritative source is "Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords". It is focused on note taking (page 2, paragraph 4). It contains eight lessons, an appendix and a dictionary with about 1,00 speedwords. Dutton claims that completing the lessons will take between 20 and 30 hours, typically 20 hours. Dutton recommends working through each lesson And immediately putting their learning to use. This is done by immediately substituting them for their longer English (or other language equivalent) when writing or note taking. Because the vocabulary is standardised there is no chance it will become unreadable. Reference can always be made to the conversion section (English-Speedword, TYDS, pages 102-112); Speedword-English, TYDS, pages 92–101) of the book to lookup forgotten Speedwords. TYDS has an excellent two-page index identifying topics, prefixes, suffixes and some Speedwords. It should be consulted whenever unsure where to find information in the book. Each lesson (chapter) contains word lists to learn, rules stated in numbered paragraphs, additional commentary, specimen sentences where the English sentence is placed immediately below the Speedword sentence so the one-for-one transcription can be readily understood. There are also drills (or exercises), and tests. Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords" is readily available in secondhand bookshops (use www.bookfinder.com to locate copies).
When learning Speedwords, the new learner should be aware of three inconsistencies and impediments to avoid frustration and confusion together with their solutions. First, there are some undefined terms in the book which the learner needs to be aware of from the outset. First, Dutton uses four terms 'parent word' (page 9, 88), 'radical' (page 88) 'word-root' (page 51, 52), and 'word family' (page 89) seemingly interchangeably to mean any Speedword with or without potential prefixes and suffixes. In the Speedwords dictionary Dutton refers to "keywords" meaning the basic or essential stem words to which prefixes and suffixes are addedneed to be known. So, this means there is ambiguity for the learner on what is the basic vocabulary of Speedwords. Some further research is under way to see if this can be clarified.
Second, some of the rationale for the selection of Speedwords does not follow Dutton's stated rule of drawing on words common to Indo-European languages. That is a Speedword should have an etymological connection to the word it represents. Moreover, there is no common pattern to these exceptions. Some are phonetic. For example, 'ru' derived from Romania (formerly spelt Rumania). Some are phonetic. For example, 'ke' (when) from 'kwen'. Some are originate in discipline practices. For example, the letter 'x' is used to mean 'if' on the basis 'x is the unknown quantity' in Algebra. Probably for these reasons Dutton recommends memorising his basic vocabulary.
Third, Dutton is also inconsistent on how he truncates a word to create his Speedword. For example, it may be the first two letters, 'au' from 'audience' to mean 'hear' but 'me' from 'more' uses the first and last letter.  An example of combining this mixed approach is 'ku' for 'include' where a letter is taken from the middle of the word and another letter is added phonetically 'k'. Again, this perhaps explains why Dutton emphasised memorising them. It is a pity that these were not addressed when preparing the 1951 edition of TYDS or its revision in 1971.
Fourth, in "Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords", pronunciation is not properly addressed. (It is addressed in his booklets). This page can assist as it has been carefully reviewed and errors reproduced in booklets have been corrected. Some websites claim that there was an improved pronunciation system devised but never published by Dutton 


=== Vowels ===
Vowels are rather similar to Latin.  When a vowel occurs at the end of a morpheme or before another vowel, it is long, otherwise it is usually short (though some suffixes shorten a preceding morpheme-final vowel).
Vowel length for the most part not phonemic, but are determined by position.  However, there is morphophonemic contrast in a few cases where a root word contrasts with a suffixed word, with suffixes that do not shorten the vowel.  For example,

pad [paːd] "paid" (pa "pay" + -d passive participle) vs pad [pad] "pad";
sud" [suːd] "improved' ( "su" + -d passive participle) vs sud [sʊd] "sudden".Only au and y are diphthongs.  Other sequences of vowels are pronounced in separate syllables, e.g. eis "ice" is [ˈeː.ɪs]. Vowel sequences in roots are ei, eu, oi, oe, ui, ue, ia, io, iu.  The sequences ie, uo are found in written contractions, but may not be pronounced that way since all written contractions should be pronounced in full.
"Y" is a consonant in ye [jɛ] "yes" and in y [ˈjoː] "was, were" only.


=== Consonants ===
Consonants are mostly as in the IPA; e.g., s is always voiceless, as in "less", g is always hard, as in "get", and r is trilled, as in Scots and Italian.  Exceptions:

c is [tʃ] (as in "itch")
j is [ʒ] (as in French)
q is [kw] (as in "quick")
sh is [ʃ] (as in English)
x is [ks] (as in English)Words spelled as a single consonant are usually pronounced as that consonant plus a "very short ee" before a vowel, and as that consonant + schwa otherwise, clearly mirroring Dutton's pronunciation of the e in "the."  The suffixes -r (agent) and -z (plural) are pronounced with a preceding schwa when they follow a consonant.[ʒ, h] do not occur in final position.  [ʃ] only occurs in final position in an unwritten affix.  A nasal [ŋ] occurs (in final position only) in two affixes, but is not written in either.  (See below.)  [j] occurs initially in just two words, ye and y; finally it arguably ends the diphthong y.  The letter w does not occur in final position, but [w] arguably ends the diphthong au.
Consonant sequences in word-initial position are bl, br, pl, pr, dr, tr, gl, gr, kl, kr, fl, fr, sl, q [kw], sp, st.  The only consonant sequence in root-medial position is tt in otto "eight".  Consonant sequences in word-final position are nd, nt, ng, lk, rb, rd, rt, rg, rk, rm, rn, st, sk, and x [ks]. But aq, though written with final consonant, is pronounced ['akwə]).


=== Unwritten consonants and vowels ===
Some morphemes spelled with a single consonant have an unwritten vowel, and one prefix spelled with a single vowel has an unwritten consonant:

b "but" is [bʊt], as in English "but"
-c (a suffix) is [tʃoː], as if it were written co.  That is, lec "mail" is pronounced [ˈleːtʃoː], not *[ˈlɛtʃ].
f "for" is [froː], as if it were written fro
m "with" is [mɪt], as if it were written mit
n "not" is [nɔt], as if it were written not
-st "-ist" is [ɪst], as if it were written ist
u- (participle) is [ʊŋ]
(though "having" is hu [hʊŋ] rather than expected *uh)
x "if" is [ɛks], as if it were written ex
y "was/were" is [joː], as if it were written yo (with the y pronounced as a consonant)
z "as" is [zuː], as if it were written zu
& "and" is [and], as if it were written andIn the versions of Speedwords prior to 1951, h "have/has" (perfect tense auxiliary) is [hiː], as if it were written hi; however, in the 1951 Dutton Speedwords Dictionary, we find that pre-1951 hid "hide" has become hi [hiː].  It is very unlikely Dutton would have kept h and hi as homophones; but we are not told how h is now to be pronounced.
Note: h (and its past tense hy and present participle hu) is used only as an auxiliary verb; "have/has" in the sense of "have/has got" is ha [haː] Some suffixes have an unwritten vowel that only occurs after certain consonants.  They are detailed below.


=== Affixes ===
As noted above, the prefixes past-tense y- [ai̯] and u- [ʊŋ] do not take stress, and u- is pronounced with an unwritten engma.  Me- [meː] and my- [mai̯] also remain unstressed when forming comparatives and superlatives, e.g. mebel [meː'bɛl] "more beautiful", mybel [mai̯'bɛl] "most beautiful".Suffixed vowels are long and take an epenthetic [j] (English y) when following a vowel.  For example, gree "awfully, extremely" (< are + e) is pronounced [ˈgreːjeː], mua "too (much)" (< mua + a) is [ˈmuːjaː] and dau "allow, grant" (< da + u) is [ˈdaːjuː] The suffixes -n and -st are derived from the speedwords un "negative" and its "professional" and are always pronounced in full and take an epenthetic [j] when following a vowel, e.g. gan "scarcely" (< ga + n) is [ˈɡaːjʊn] and rist "clerk" (< ri + st) is [ˈriːjɪst].The words co "collect, collection" and za "dear, endearment, intimate" may also be used as suffixes; if appended to a word ending in a vowel, they do not shorten that vowel, e.g. lec "correspondence, mail" is [ˈleːtʃoː] and perza "dad(dy), papa" is [ˈpɛrzaː] Suffixes pronounced as a single consonant after a vowel generally shorten that vowel.  The exceptions are -d, -z, -r, which leave the vowel long.  (As noted above, -z and -r take an epenthetic schwa after any consonant.)  Many consonants are pronounced with an unwritten vowel after certain consonants:

-d is pronounced [d] after vowels and voiced consonants but d, and [ɛd] after d and voiceless consonants.
-m (derived from the word om "article, object, thing") shortens a preceding vowel and is pronounced [ɔm] after any consonant, e.g. dam "donation, gift, present" (< da + m) is [dam] and tegm "cover, lid" (< teg + m) is [ˈtegɔm] 
Other single-consonant suffixes - -b (< ib "possible"), -g (< ig "general"), -k (< ik "property, quality", -l (< il "particular (e)special", -p (< ep "location, place, position, set, put"), -s (< is "complement") and -t (< et "little, small") - shorten the preceding vowel and, when they "can be articulated without difficulty" are pronounced as a single consonant after another consonant, otherwise they are pronounced in full as the words from they are derived after other consonants.  Dutton adds that -s must always be pronounced [ɪs] after word ending in -k or -g "to avoid confusion with the suffix -x.In addition, three suffixes have completely different forms after consonants and vowels:
-f after vowels and -y after consonants
-v after vowels and -i after consonants
-x after vowels and -o after consonantsf ~ -y are obviously abstracted from fy "cause, make, reason, render"; the pairs -v ~ -i and -x ~ -o appear to be arbitrary creations.
Also in the pre-1951version of Speedwords, Dutton gave the apostrophe as a possessive suffix pronounced [zai̯], e.g. l mant'kap [lə'mantzai̯kap] "the boy's head".  But in the 1951 Dictionary Dutton list a new root word zy [zai̯] "disease".  It is inconceivable that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe homophonous with zy "disease." The apostrophe is retained in "Teach Yourself Dutton Sppedwords" (1951, 1971) but there is no indication how this is to be pronounced.


=== Irregularities to avoid homophones ===
The only examples specifically given by Dutton are:

"away" as an opposite of directional a "to" is ao [aː'joː] as *ax would be homophonous with ax "ask." 
The agent suffix -r (< er "person") is written as the full word and pronounced with an epenthetic  [j], when it would otherwise create a homophone with an existing word.  For example, "maker" is maer [ˈmaːjɛr] to avoid confusion with mar [mar] "marry, marriage" (In "Dutton Double-Speed Words Companion to Text-Book", Dutton also gives jeer "judge" [ˈʒuːjɛr] to avoid confusion with jur [ʒʊr] "law, legal"; in the 1951 Dictionary, however, "judge" is given as just [ˈʒuːjɪst]Following 2 above, we may reasonably assume that if adding -b, -c, -g, -k, -l, -m, -n, -p, -s or -t, then the full word from which these are derived would have been written and pronounced with an epenthetic  [j], thus *noib "noticeable" [ˈnoːjɪb] to avoid confusion with nob "celebrated, honour, note, repute" [nɔb].
Following 1 above, we may reasonably assume that this would always be the case if by adding -x a homophone would have been created.  We may also assume that the same would apply to the -v ~ -i pair, i.e. if by adding -v we had a homophone, we must add -i [ˈjiː instead; the same well have applied to the -f ~ y pair, i.e. if by adding -f we had a homophone, we must add -y {IPA|[ˈjai̯}} instead; but as these suffixes derive from the word fy, it may be that Dutton, following 1 above, would have added -fy.


=== Compound words ===
When two roots form a compound, the unwritten affix [ŋ] is placed after the first root.  When three roots form a compound, the unwritten affix [ʃ] is placed after the first root.  Either affix takes an epenthetic [ɪ] after a consonant.   Examples:

albe "already" (< al + be) is [ˈalɪŋbeː]
diel "telephone" (< di + el) is [ˈdiːŋɛl]
rysan "hospital" (< ry + san) is [ˈrai̯ŋsan]
opmekav "anti-aircraft" (< op + mek + av) is [ˈɔpɪʃmɛkav] 'OPP-ish-mek-avv'
ryefki "gymnasium" (< ry + ef + ki) is [ˈrai̯ʃɛfkiː]


== Morphology and syntax ==
Root words may function as adjective, noun, verb or adverb.  In "Dutton Speedwords Dictionary" (1951, London, Dutton Publications) we read:
"The English language, like most other natural languages, is inconsistent in having separate words for the adjective 'hot' and the noun 'heat' whereas the same word 'cold' can function as either a noun or an adjective according to its context.  What applies to 'cold' can logically apply also to 'hot'; consequently the Speedword he denotes either 'heat' or 'hot', according to circumstance. ...
"Just as there is no distinction in English between the noun 'cold' and the adjective 'cold', so there is none between the adjective 'fast' and the adverb 'fast' (there being no English word 'fastly' corresponding to 'slowly').  What applies to the adjective 'fast' can logically apply also to other qualifiers, and consequently there is no necessity to differentiate between, say, 'beautiful' and 'beautifully'. This means that, in international correspondence, the Speedword bel can convey not only 'beauty' and 'beautiful' ... but 'beautifully' as well ...
"Verbs and nouns are similarly interchangeable, for in the same way that each of the English words 'work', 'answer' and 'praise' can function either as a verb or noun according to its environment, so can any other word have a dual role.  In English the noun form of the verb 'fail' is 'failure', and of 'pay' 'payment'; but in everyday expressions such as 'without fail' and 'in his pay' the unnecessary distinction has been eliminated ... the Soeedword policy is to cut the Gordian knot and make pa mean either 'pay' or 'payment', pre either 'prepare' or 'preparation', kok 'cook' or 'cookery', men 'remember' to 'memory', and so on throughout." There are, however, grammatical affixes pertinent to particular parts of speech.


=== Verb affixes ===
The present tense is unmarked, e.g. j spe [ʒə 'speː] "I speak".
The past is marked by the unstressed prefix y- [ai̯], e.g. j yspe [ʒi ai̯'speː] "I spoke".
Two verbs are irregular:
to be: e [eː] "be, am. is, are"; y [joː] "was, were".
to have (perfect auxiliary): h (post-1951 pronunciation unknown) "has, have"; hy [hai̯] "had".The unmarked form also serves as the infinitive,  e.g.sh am spe [ʃi'am 'speː] "she loves to speak" There are two participles:

Present participle has prefix u- [ʊŋ], e.g. uspe [ʊŋ'speː] "speaking"
Perfect participle has suffix -d [d, ɛd], e.g. sped [speːd] "spoken"Only one irregular verb: the present participle of the auxiliary h is hu  [hʊŋ]Note: Dutton is quite clear that the prefix u forms a participle, i.e. a verbal adjective, e.g. u uspe tem [uː ʊŋ'speː tem] 'a speaking clock', l ura on [li ʊŋ'raː 'ɔn] "the working man."   Indeed he devotes five paragraphs to hammer this point home. Dutton devotes six paragraphs to hammer home the difference between the English gerund (verbal noun) and the present participle.  He is adamant that forms prefixed with u- may be used only as a present participle.  In Speedwords the gerund must be expressed by the same form as the infinitive, i.e. the unmarked verb, e.g. g amt spe [ɡi 'amt speːd "they like speaking", gi ko & go  [ɡiː 'koː and 'goː] "their coming and going"
Note also that 

the continuous tenses are formed with "to be" and the unmarked verb, e.g. s e ri [si 'eː 'riː] "he is writing"; w y ri [wə 'joː 'riː] "we were writing".
the perfect tenses are form with the auxiliary h and the unmarked verb, e.g. s h ri "he has written; g hy spe "they had spoken".


=== Noun affixes ===
The plural, where necessary, is shown by the suffix -z, e.g. femz ['fɛməz] "women".  Dutton is emphatic that if it is clear from context that the noun must be plural, the ending -z is not used, e.g. ud fem [ʊd 'fɛm] "many women"; cz on [tʃəz 'ɔn] In the pre-1951 version pf Speedwords, the possessive of nouns is [zai̯], and written with an apostrophe, e.g. l fem' ryg lə 'fɛmzai̯ 'rai̯ɡ] "the woman's house"; but in 1951, Dutton introduced a new root word zy [zai̯] meaning "disease".  It is very unlikely that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe with the same sound.  But we do not know what he subsequently did. 


=== Adjective/ Adverb affixes ===
me- [ˈmeː] comparative, more, -er (< me greater, increase, more), e.g. mebel [meː'bɛl] "more beautiful(ly)"
my- [ˈmai̯] superlative, most, -est (< my most), e.g. mybel [mai̯ː'bɛl] "most beautiful(ly)"


=== Word Formative Suffixes ===
-a [(j)aː] unfavourable
-b [b, ɪb] possibility, -ible, -able (< ib possible)
-c [tʃoː] collection (< co collect, collection)
-e [(j)eː] augmentative
-f [f] causative (after a vowel) (< fy cause, make, reason, render)
-g [ɡ, ɪɡ] (an idea having a general relationship to the root) (< ig general)
-i [iː] association (after a consonant), possessive on pronouns
-k [k, ɪk] quality, -ic (< ik property, quality)
-l [l, ɪl] (an idea having a special relationship to the root) (< il particular, special, especial)
-m [m, ɔm] thing (< om article, object, thing)
-n [(j)ʊn] negative, -less, in-, un- (< un negative)
-o [oː] contrary, opposite (after a consonant)
-p [p, ɛp] place (< ep location, place, position, put, set)
-r [r, ər, jɛr] person, agent, -er (< er person)
-s [s, ɪs] (an idea having a complementary relationship to the root) (< is complement)
-t [t, ɛt] diminutive, -ette (< et little, small)
-u [(j)uː] favorable
-v [v] association (after a vowel)
-x [ks] contrary, opposite (after a vowel)
-y [ai̯] causative (after a consonant) (< fy cause, make, reason, render)
-z [z, əz] plural, -s
-st [ɪst] professional, -ist (< ist professional)In "Dutton World Speedwords" we are given on page 64, §328, the 'indefinite preposition' iv.  But it is clear from Dutton's entry that the affixes -i and -v are not derived from this preposition but rather that the preposition is a backformation from the affixes.  
Dutton says [words in italics were written as italicized speedwords in the original]: "The prepositions 'at', 'on', 'by', 'under', etc. are sometimes used to convey a somewhat loose idea of association without any definite idea of position, as in 'at the most', 'by the way', 'on business', 'under difficulties', etc.  When, therefore, any preposition is not literally applicable, the Speedword  'iv' is used.  This Speedword consists of the two association suffixes  'i-' and '-v' and hence appropriately conveys the idea of association without definite sense of place."


=== Interfixes (not written) ===
- [ŋ, ɪŋ] two-root compound
- [ʃ, ɪʃ] three-root compoundFor examples see Compound words in the 'Phonology and orthography' section above.


== Potential improvements to Speedwords ==
The improvements are overcoming ambiguities, removing omissions or deficiencies, and overcoming confusion.A major ambiguity is terminological. Dutton uses three terms interchangeably. They are "radical", "parent-word", and, "root-word". He sometimes uses them identically, to mean the stem, that is an indivisible element and other times to mean the indivisible element plus prefix or suffix or the compounds of indivisible elements. By doing so he lacks the ability to distinguish between them. It would be much simpler to reserve the three terms for the indivisible element and then use the term "extension" for the addition of prefix or suffix. "Compound" would retain its existing usage.
Some obvious omissions and deficiencies could have easily been rectified by Dutton from his personal knowledge for either the 1962 reprint or a later revision. The major omission is a description of his rationale behind formulating the Speedwords he has chosen. In his opening chapter of all editions of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords titled "Dutton Speedwords Analysed" he describes some of the principles he used. For example, using Horn's analysis of frequently used words  to determine how much to abbreviate or truncate his Speedword vocabulary, and, drawing on words common to several European languages. But this does not equate to a systematic account of how new technical words and expressions could be added to the Speedword vocabulary.
An overcoming confusion caused by apparent inconsistencies in understanding what is meant by particular Speedwords given the variety of Speedword formation methods available. There are four possible areas of confusion. First, deciphering the meaning of a Speedword can produce several possible candidate meanings. There are 20 suffixes and it is impossible to be sure whether a Speedword is either a Speedword stem (that is, an indivisible element) or a Speedword and a suffix. For example, the Speedword 'de' is day, 'deb' is debt but 'debe' is yesterday. Dutton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Second, contractions of frequently used Speedwords actually multiply the vocabulary by creating new Speedwords. For example, 'debe' yesterday is shortened to 'db', and 'jecen' percent is shortened to 'jc'. Again, Dutton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Third, there are some puzzling inconsistencies. For example, 'La' is great, 'Mla' is greater. Is unclear whether this is a misprint with the L in lower case and what the 'm' signifies. Finally, Dutton encourages joining Speedwords together as compounds except where they are equivalent to an existing Speedword. This seems to increase the vocabulary reducing the benefit of keeping the vocabulary small.

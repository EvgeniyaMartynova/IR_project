== Video ==
The scene for the video is set in a club with a bar and sees Jade and all her girls with their boyfriends hanging out, as Jade follows the camera as it changes angles.
The video then fades out to Jade singing with her band behind her at the same club, before fading out a second time to Jade's fellow R&B star Israel who also produced her album, as he adds his rap to the track, before going back to Jade as she performs to the crowd.

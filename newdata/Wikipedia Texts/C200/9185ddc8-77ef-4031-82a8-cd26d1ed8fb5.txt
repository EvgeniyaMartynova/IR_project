SsangYong C200

The SsangYong Korando is a Subcompact SUV or Compact crossover SUV built by the South Korean automobile manufacturer SsangYong from 1983 to 2006 and from 2010 onwards. The name Korando is a contraction of "Korea Can Do".
The Korando brand is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as Korea’s longest surviving name plate.


== First generation (1982–1996) ==

In 1964 Ha Dong-hwan Motor Company began to assemble Jeeps, trucks, and buses for the US armed forces and for the United Nations Command. In November 1969, the CJ-5 entered production with the 75 hp (56 kW) Willys Hurricane inline-four engine and in 1971, a ten-seater version and a pickup model were introduced. In April 1974, American Motors and Shinjin Motors formed a joint venture, Shinjin Jeep Motors, to build Jeeps locally. Sold under the Asia Motors badge, military Jeeps were built (M38A1, M606) as the Asia KM410. This range eventually developed into the Asia Rocsta. The civilian CJ-5 Jeep was built as the Asia Landmaster from September 1974, with a long-wheelbase model added in 1977. These originally had a locally built AMC 258 ci straight-six engine with 110 hp (82 kW) SAE, but after the oil crises of the seventies Isuzu's 2.8-liter 4BA1 diesel engine with 85 hp (63 kW) SAE was introduced in July 1979. Troubled AMC withdrew from South Korea in August 1978. Shinjin Motors sold a shipment of Jeeps to Libya in 1979, in spite of the embargo, and this led to another ownership shakeup as it invalidated the license. Geohwa Co. Ltd. took over production in March 1981, and rotated the bars in the grille to minimize the resemblance to a Jeep. It remained available on two wheelbases of 2,390 or 2,895 mm (94.1 or 114.0 in), with the AMC inline-six or the Isuzu 2.8-liter diesel. In November 1982, the nine-seater "Family Deluxe" was introduced, and the range was renamed "Korando" in March 1983.

Geohwa was absorbed by Dong-A Motor in December 1984, and a facelift followed in March 1985. The new model had a changed interior and the large diesel was replaced by the 2238 cc Isuzu C223 engine. The pickup version was discontinued. In June, Isuzu's 2-liter G200Z petrol engine was added. In 1986 Korandos were exported to Japan; and in 1988 Ssangyong began exporting them to Europe. In November 1986 Dong-A was integrated into the SsangYong Group, who changed the company's name to SsangYong Motor Company in March 1988. Unlike the CJ-7, a 9-seat extended version was also available, called the Korando K9. In late 1988 a new SUV on the chassis of the Isuzu Trooper was introduced, called the SsangYong Korando Family, but this car has no relation to the Jeep CJ-7 beyond the "Korando" nameplate. Production of the Jeep-based Korando ended in 1996.


== Second generation (1996–2006) ==
The second generation "New" Korando was released in Asia in 1996 to complement the SsangYong Musso (released in 1993), released in Europe in 1997 and in Australia in 1998 and was based on a shortened version of the Musso's chassis. The 1.8 tonne 3-door mini SUV was designed by Professor Ken Greenly.It features a choice of 2.3- and 3.2-liter gasoline engines, or 2.3- and 2.9-liter diesel engines, all produced on license from Mercedes-Benz, accompanied by a five-speed manual Borg-Warner gearbox. The interior of the second generation Korando was unique because it had a steering wheel arch on either side. This was to make converting to right-hand-drive easier and to cut down on production costs. On the passenger's side, a handle was fitted in the arch. This generation was sold as the Daewoo Korando from 1999 to 2001, as Daewoo bought a majority stake in SsangYong, but was later forced to sell its shares.


=== Revision ===
Production of the second generation ended in 2006. Sales however in many markets continued through to 2007 due to remaining stock. It was available with a variety of petrol and diesel engines, including a 2.9-liter five-cylinder diesel from Mercedes-Benz. In 2008, Russian TagAZ, under license, began to assemble the Korando as the TagAZ Tager, not only three-door guise, but also in a specific five-door long wheelbase version.
In 2017, Ssangyong previewed a concept car called the XAV Adventure, which had design features heavily inspired by the second generation of Korando.

The concept car C200 Aero made its debut at the 2009 Seoul Motor Show. It was released one year later as Korando C with almost no modification of the original Giugiaro design.


==== C200 Eco ====
The C200 Eco made its debut at the 2009 Seoul Motor Show. It is a hybrid which uses both a diesel engine and an electric one (powered by a 340 volt battery). It also uses a stop-start system which shuts off the engine during stops. Fuel saving will be around 25%. The interior features a green trim and an airy cabin.


==== Korando C ====
Launched at the 2010 Busan International Motor Show, the new Korando C concept has stayed mostly the same as the previous concepts but has more aggressive styling and is said to be a representation of the production version. Performance-wise, the new concept has a 2.0-liter turbo-diesel engine and a confirmed power output of 135 kW (184 PS; 181 hp) and 360 N⋅m (270 lb⋅ft) of torque.

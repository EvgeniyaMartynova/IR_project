List of former Extreme Championship Wrestling personnel

This is a list of professional wrestlers and other people who appeared in the original incarnation of Extreme Championship Wrestling
Performers are listed in alphabetical order by the ringname(s) they used in ECW (e.g. Roadkill, not Amish Roadkill). Normal alphabetical order applies. Dates listed are for when a performer used that name, not the entire time the performer was active.

Performers are listed by surname or its equivalent (e.g. all Dudleys are under D, 2 Cold Scorpio, who also spelled his name as Too Cold Scorpio, under S)Wrestlers who used more than one ringname while in ECW will be listed under the ring name for which they used the most or were best known in order to clean up the list, since any performer who used multiple ring names most likely has them listed on their personal article page with their current or most used ring name in bold on said page.  Their other ring names will be listed after their name next to their years worked.
Stables and tag teams will be listed alphabetically in their own separate section at the bottom of the list.

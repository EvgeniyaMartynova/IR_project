== History ==
Cheverly was begun as a planned suburb in the early 1900s. The Cheverly area was first platted in 1904 for a 93-acre (380,000 m2) community called Cheverly Gardens. The land was subsequently purchased in 1918 by Robert Marshall, president of the Washington Suburban Realty Company. The Cheverly subdivision platted by Marshall was developed around the 1839 Magruder family homestead known as Mount Hope. Marshall became the first resident of Cheverly by taking up residence in the restored homestead in 1919. In 1923, the first road, now known as Cheverly Avenue, was completed and paved to connect the Pennsylvania Railroad line to Landover Road. 34 developer-built houses were constructed between 1921 and 1925. Most of the early houses were mail-order homes from Sears & Roebuck and the McClure Homes Company. Marshall lost control of the Washington Suburban Realty Company in 1927. Harry Wardman assumed the position until the company’s bankruptcy in 1929 due to the stock market crash.Incorporation was granted in 1931 to address concerns for better roads and services. During the 1930s and 1940s, the streets were improved and lighting enhanced, and the number of residences increased from 135 to 650. Residential construction continued through the 1960s, creating a varied housing stock of early Cape Cod houses, with later ranch and split-level types. Two garden-style apartment complexes (Cheverly Terrace and Hanson Arms) were constructed in the early 1960s along Landover Road near the U.S. Route 50 interchange. The community center, town hall, and park facility was built in 1978. Industrial property was established in 1958 on the west side of town and adjacent to Route 50.On April 29, 2006, the community held a 75th anniversary celebration at the town community center. The historic home Mount Hope has been the town's official symbol since 1931.

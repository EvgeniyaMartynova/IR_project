== History ==

At almost 36 square miles in size, Woodbury is a direct descendant of one of the congressional townships that Minnesota Territory was divided into when the territory was ceded by the Native Americans of the United States and "opened to settlement."  Woodbury was originally named Red Rock, but was renamed Woodbury after Levi Woodbury, the first justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to attend law school, realized that another Red Rock existed in Minnesota. When first settled in 1844, the land was mostly wood but was converted to farmland.  The township government was organized in 1858.  One of the city's few surviving 19th-century farms, the Charles Spangenberg Farmstead, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.The first suburban housing development began in 1955, and the city has seen an increasing level of metropolitan expansion as the farmland has given way to developments and shopping malls.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 35.56 square miles (92.10 km2), of which, 34.73 square miles (89.95 km2) is land and 0.83 square miles (2.15 km2) is water.The city is bounded on the northern side by Interstate 94, the south by 60th Street, the west by Century Avenue, and the east by Manning Avenue.

There are also many smaller employers, such as the Joint Commission on Allied Health Personnel in Ophthalmology and offices for financial corporations.  Many Woodbury residents are employed at 3M, whose headquarters are located a few miles west in Maplewood.
A large portion of the economy is retail.  The two largest retail centers are Tamarack Village, near the intersection of Radio Drive and Interstate 94, and Woodbury Village, near the intersection of Valley Creek Road and Interstate 494.

Because most of Woodbury is located within the South Washington County School District, the majority of high school students attend either Woodbury High School or East Ridge High School.  However, small portions of the city attend Tartan Senior High School in Oakdale and Stillwater Area High School in Stillwater.  Some students attend public or private schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota's open enrollment statute.

In November 2006, School District 833 selected an 80-acre (320,000 m2) site for a third high school, later named East Ridge High School. The site lies between two city-owned properties south of Bailey Road and east of Radio Drive: the 80-acre (320,000 m2) HealthEast Sports Center and the Danner gravel pit.  The city also owns an additional 80 acres (320,000 m2) south of the sports center to allow for expansion.  The new school opened in September 2009. The students attending this new High School came from Woodbury and nearby Cottage Grove as well as Newport and Saint Paul Park. Aaron Harper served as the school's principal.

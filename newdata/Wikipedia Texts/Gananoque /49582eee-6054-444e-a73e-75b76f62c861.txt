Gananoque Airport

Gananoque Airport, (TC LID: CNN8), is located 4.3 nautical miles (8.0 km; 4.9 mi) northwest of the town of Gananoque, Ontario, Canada, in Canada's busy Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. It is currently a major centre for skydiving, as well as one of the three Canadian airports serving the Thousand Islands (along with Kingston/Norman Rogers Airport and Brockville Regional Tackaberry Airport).


== History ==
The Gananoque Airport was a relief landing field for RCAF Station Kingston (now Kingston/Norman Rogers Airport) during World War II, and with Kingston, participated in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The field preserves the original, classic BCATP triangular runway arrangement along with some of the original wartime structures. Since 1971, the airport has been utilized as a sports skydiving dropzone with jumps available to the general public.

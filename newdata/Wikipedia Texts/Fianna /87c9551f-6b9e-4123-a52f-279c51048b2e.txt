Na Fianna GAA

CLG Na Fianna (Irish: Cumann Lúthchleas Gael Na Fianna) is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in Glasnevin, in the Northside of Dublin, Ireland. It caters for the sporting and social needs of many connected residential areas adjacent to its location through the promotion of Gaelic games — Gaelic football, hurling, camogie, handball and rounders—and the traditional Irish pursuits of music and dance. Céilí music and dancing is a regular feature in the club hall, while informal music sessions are a regular feature of the members’ bar.


== Background ==
Na Fianna was officially formed as a club on 25 April 1955, when 201 members transferred from C.J. Kickham GAA Club to form Cumann Luthchleas Gael Na Fianna. The first Annual General Meeting took place on 27 October 1955 later that year. Na Fianna's first clubhouse was originally transported from the Guinness Sports Grounds in Crumlin to Mobhi Road but was burnt to the ground in May 1967. The members built a new clubhouse five years after the fire. Aras Na Fianna was the first GAA clubhouse in the country to include a members' bar and cater for all GAA sports including a handball alley. It served its members for almost twenty years before a further extension was built. Again in 2005 further extensions and a major refurbishment was undertaken reflecting the massive growth in membership in the intervening periodNa Fianna is a member of the Dublin GAA bodies in all the Gaelic codes of Gaelic football, hurling, camogie, ladies football and handball, and is therefore affiliated to the national organisation, the Gaelic Athletic Association. Being in the parish of Glasnevin it connects to the many family residents in the Mobhi Road/ Homefarm Road/ Ballymun Road/ Botanic Road axis, while extending its influence  to the edges of Phibsboro, North Circular Road, Glasnevin Avenue, Drumcondra Road and Griffith Avenue, thus taking in all the Iona and Drumcondra residents also. The club also has affiliations with the many schools, both primary and post-primary, in this wide catchment area. The liaison between the club and schools offers parents and children a consistent engagement in sporting and non-sporting activities.
Na Fianna has been a leading proponent of Irish culture and the Na Fianna Céilí has long since been a tradition of the club. The club’s involvement in GAA Scór is an extension of its own regular internal Scór sessions. `

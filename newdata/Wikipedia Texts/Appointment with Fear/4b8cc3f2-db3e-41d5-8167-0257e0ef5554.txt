== Rules ==

As with titles such as House of Hell and Sword of the Samurai, Appointment with F.E.A.R. utilizes an additional game mechanicâ€”in this instance "Hero Points", which are awarded to the player for every villain captured and disaster averted. Gameplay includes two other features: the player may choose which super-powers they wish to utilize (which in turn affects the outcome); and the player must also collect clues which will allow the hero to catch criminals and ultimately learn the location of a meeting of evil masterminds. Unlike other titles, the story features 440 references as opposed to the typical 400.


== Story ==
The reader assumes the role of Jean Lafayette, secretly the Silver Crusader, a superhero who protects the fictional Titan City. The reader chooses from four super-powers (strength and flight, gadgets, psychic powers or energy blasts) and battles criminals such as the Scarlet Prankster, Dr. Macabre, the Serpent and the Alchemists. In addition to catching criminals, the reader's ultimate goal is to determine the time and place of the imminent meeting between the leaders of evil organization F.E.A.R. (the Federation of Euro-American Rebels) and capture their leader Vladimir Utoshiki, the "Titanium Cyborg".


== Reception ==
Fantasy Book Review stated "In a change from the traditional sword and sorcery based FF books, this sci-fi romp has dispensed with Gold Pieces, Potions and Items and replaced them with Hero Points and Clues...While this is not the best FF book that Steve Jackson ever wrote it is an excellent gamebook..."

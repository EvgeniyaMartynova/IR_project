Warburton baronets

The Warburton Baronetcy, of Arley in the County of Chester, was a title in the Baronetage of England. It was created on 27 June 1660 by Charles II for George Warburton, of Arley Hall, Cheshire, whose great-uncle had been Sergeant at Law and a Justice of Common Pleas  in the time of Charles I. The Warburton family removed from Warburton, Cheshire to Arley in the 14th century. The third Baronet was a Knight of the Shire for Cheshire. The title became extinct on the death of the fifth Baronet in 1813. The Cheshire estates passed into the Egerton-Warburton family and then to Viscount Ashbrook.

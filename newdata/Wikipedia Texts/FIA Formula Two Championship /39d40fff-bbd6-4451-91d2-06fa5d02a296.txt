FIA Formula 2 Championship

The FIA Formula 2 Championship is a second-tier single-seater racing championship organised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The championship was introduced in 2017, following the rebranding of the long-term Formula One feeder series GP2.
Designed to make racing affordable for the teams and to make it an ideal training ground for life in Formula One, Formula 2 has made it mandatory for all of the teams to use the same chassis, engine and tyre supplier so that true driver ability is reflected. Formula 2 mainly races on European circuits, but has appearances on other international race tracks as well with their most recent races in the 2017 season at the Bahrain International Circuit in Bahrain and the Yas Marina Circuit in United Arab Emirates.


== Numbering system ==
The numbering system in FIA Formula 2 Championship is currently based as previous season's team standings (similar to Formula One 1996–2013 numbering system) that used since GP2 Series formation in 2005 until present.


== Race weekend ==
On Friday, drivers have a 45-minute free practice session and a 30-minute qualifying session. The qualifying session decides the grid order for Saturday's race which has a length of 180 kilometres (112 miles).
During Saturday's race (Feature Race), each driver must complete one compulsory pitstop and must use at least one set of each specification of dry-weather tyres.
Sunday's race (Sprint Race) is run over 120 kilometres (75 miles). The grid is decided by the Saturday result with top 8 being reversed, so the driver who finished 8th on Saturday will start from pole position and the winner will start from 8th place.
The exceptions to these rules are the Monaco and Budapest where the Feature Race is run over 140 km (87 miles) and 160 km (100 miles), respectively and the Monaco Sprint Race where the race is run over 100 km (60 miles). The races length is also limited to 60 minutes for Feature Race and 45 minutes for Sprint Race. Usually the Monaco round race sessions held in Friday and Saturday since 2005.


=== Point system ===
Feature races will be run with a scoring system similar to the one used in Formula One:

The top eight finishers in a sprint race receive points as follows:

Pole position for the feature race will now be worth 4 points, and 2 points will be given for the fastest lap in each race. Therefore, the maximum number of points a driver can score at any round will be 48. The driver recording the fastest lap has to drive 90% of race laps and must finish in the top ten of the race to be eligible for the fastest lap points.
In the case of a tie, FIA Formula 2 Championship will determine the champion based on the most first-place finishes. If there is still a tie, FIA Formula 2 Championship will determine the champion by the most second-place finishes, then the most third-place finishes, etc., until a champion is determined. FIA Formula 2 Championship will apply the same system to other ties in the rankings at the close of the season and at any other time during the season.


== Car specifications ==
The FIA Formula 2 Championship car is used by all of the teams, and features a Dallara carbon-fiber monocoque chassis powered by a Mecachrome single-turbocharged direct-injected V6 engine and Pirelli dry slick and rain treaded tyres. Overall weight is 755 kg including driver.

Rear-view mirrors for all FIA Formula 2 cars are fully mandated to easily view opponents behind.


=== Engine ===


===== First-generation (2005–2017) =====
Starting in 2005 (under GP2 Series name), Formula 2 cars were powered by 4.0 L (244 cu in) V8, four-stroke piston, Otto cycle unleaded gasoline-burning, prototype production-based, naturally-aspirated engines, produced by Mecachrome. Per Formula 2 rules, the engines sold for no more than €70,000 and were rev-limited to 10,000 rpm. They produced around 612 hp (456 kW; 620 PS) and weighed up to 148 kg (326 lb).
FIA Formula 2 Championship first-generation engines were rev-limited to 10,000 rpm and produce approximately 612 hp. The valve train is a dual overhead camshaft configuration with four valves per cylinder. The crankshaft is made of alloy steel, with five main bearing caps. The pistons are forged aluminium alloy, while the connecting rods are machined alloy steel. The electronic engine management system is supplied by Magneti Marelli, firing a CDI ignition system. The engine lubrication is a dry sump type, cooled by a single water pump.


===== Second-generation (2018–present) =====
The series uses four-stroke piston Otto cycle 620 hp 3.4-litre V6 DOHC single-turbocharged direct-injected fuel-efficient engines which resemble the FIA Formula 3 Championship engine model supplied by Mecachrome, prepared and maintained by Teos Engineering. The V634 Turbo was unveiled in 2017 along with the new Dallara F2 2018 chassis but will be used from 2018 onwards. Dutch turbocharger company Van Der Lee Turbo Systems currently supplies the turbochargers for all FIA Formula 2 Championship all-new engines.
All FIA Formula 2 Championship cars switched from a 4.0 L (244 cu in) V8 naturally-aspirated indirect electronic injection to an all-new 4-stroke piston Otto cycle fuel-efficient 3.4 L (207 cu in) V6 turbocharged direct injection engine from the 2018 season onwards. This will mark the introduction of turbocharged engines in 2018 season for the first time ever in the history of the sport. The all-new engine fuel delivery currently gasoline direct injection instead of traditional electronic indirect injection. The power output of all-new FIA Formula 2 engine will be increased from 612 to 620 hp (456 to 462 kW; 620 to 629 PS). Mecachrome will continue providing FIA Formula 2 new engines from 2018 season beyond. The new Mecachrome V634 Turbo engine rev limit scaled down to 8,750 rpm and weighed up to 132 kg (291 lb) including turbocharger. The firing ignition of Mecachrome V634 Turbo engine are revolutionary digital inductive. The fuel-mass flow restrictor rate of second-generation FIA Formula 2 Championship engine is roughly worth at 105 kg/h (231 lb/h).
The Mecachrome V634 Turbo 3.4-litre single-turbocharged direct-injected Mecachrome V6 engine is an evolution of the GP3 engine, which is the solely supplied engine for the FIA Formula 2 Championship. With the addition of a single turbo, the engine has undergone rigorous dyno testing, ahead of its racing debut. The Mecachrome V634 Turbo engines sold for up to €67,000 per unit.


====== Turbocharger ======
The turbochargers are introduced from the start of 2018 season. The turbo configuration is single-turbocharged and producing the turbo boost level pressure up to 1.5 bar (22 psi). Dutch turbocharger company Van Der Lee Turbo Systems currently supplies the turbochargers for all FIA Formula 2 Championship all-new engines using the MT134-50120 model. The turbocharger spin rev limit spins up to 125,000 rpm but not exceeding 130,000 rpm due to lower turbo boost pressure.


==== Fuel and lubricants components ====
All Formula 2 cars currently use ordinary unleaded racing gasoline as fuel (similar to commercial vehicle unleaded street gasoline), which has been the de facto standard in second tier single-seater formula racing since the introduction of GP2 Series in 2005. Current Elf LMS 102 RON unleaded gasoline resembles ordinary unleaded gasoline but produces better mileage while being environmental-friendly and safer than leaded fuels. Since 2005 GP2 Series season, Elf exclusively continues providing the LMS 102 RON unleaded fuel and also Elf HTX 840 0W-40 lubricants for all FIA Formula 2 Championship cars due to in fact of Mecachrome's long-term technical partnership with Elf.


=== Other parts ===
The car also features internal cooling upgrades, a new water radiator, radiator duct, oil/water heat exchanger, modified oil degasser, new oil and water pipes and new heat exchanger fixing brackets.


=== Performance ===
According to research and pre-season stability tests, the 2005 model can accelerate from 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 6.7 seconds. The car has a top speed of 320 km/h (199 mph) meaning that it is the fastest single seater racing car behind Formula One and IndyCar Series.The 2011 model can accelerate from 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.6 seconds.The car has a top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph) with the Monza aero configuration.

Fraser International College

Fraser International College (FIC) is located in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada and was opened in September 2006.
FIC is a private educational business that operates under an agreement with Simon Fraser University.  Courses at FIC are designed in consultation with faculty and departments at SFU, which allows for an oversight of course material and quality.

While under original and preliminary discussions at SFU, the FIC proposal (then called IBT) was the source of no deal of controversy.  FIC is operated by Navitas Limited, a publicly listed Australian educational company (formally International Business and Technology Education Ltd.).
FIC currently has more than 1300 students enrolled. Students in FIC come from more than 35 countries/regions.

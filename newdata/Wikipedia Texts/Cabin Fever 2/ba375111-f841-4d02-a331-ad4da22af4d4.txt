== Critical response ==
Jesse Fairfax of HipHopDX said, "While not exactly pioneering anything new, Cabin Fever 2 further establishes Wiz Khalifa as a serviceable rapper aware enough to blend in with what's popular for the sake of maintaining a presence. Largely dependent on the blueprints laid by Three 6 Mafia and  Lex Luger, he brings life to the typically mundane and makes up for instances such as French Montana's barely decipherable verse on "Nothin Like the Rest." In spite of his trendy one-dimensional concepts, there is ultimately redeemable art and magic to be found in Wiz's work here."

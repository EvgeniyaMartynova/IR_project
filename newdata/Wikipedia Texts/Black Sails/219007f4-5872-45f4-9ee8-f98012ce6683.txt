The first three tracks can be found on the album Black Sails in the Sunset, with several minor changes. On the full-length album, "Porphyria" is re-titled "Porphyria Cutanea Tarda" and contains a crossfade into the next track, "Exsanguination". "Who Knew?" is a B-Side from the full-length album, and appears on the Japanese edition of Black Sails in the Sunset. This is the first release with Jade Puget as an official member of the band.

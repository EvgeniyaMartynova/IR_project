His father Major Pramod Nath Datt also served in the Gorkha Rifles and was the reason Puneet Nath Datt was inspired to join the same regiment. His grandfather Col. S.N.C Bakshi also served in the Indian Army while his uncle V. K. C. Bakhshi was a Commander in the Indian Navy. The posthumous Ashok Chakra was received on his behalf by his mother, Anita Datt, from the President of India on 26 January 1998, India's Republic Day.

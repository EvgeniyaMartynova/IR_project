Appleseed (EP)

Appleseed is an EP by the American hip hop artist Aesop Rock, the second of two self-released CDs before his first Mush Records album, Float (2000). It is available only on CD-R. The artwork for this EP was by Aesop Rock and Neal Usatin. The track "Dryspell" liberally samples the song "Peace" by Ornette Coleman.
The album was re-released for the summer 2008 tour, but only 1,000 copies were printed. The EP has since been auctioned on the Internet at numerous websites, with pricess ranging from 80 to 100 dollars. It was released again for the 2012 Skelethon tour.

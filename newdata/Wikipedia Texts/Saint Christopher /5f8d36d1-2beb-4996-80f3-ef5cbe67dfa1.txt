St. Christopher's School, Richmond

St. Christopher's School, founded in 1911, is a college preparatory school for boys (junior kindergarten through 12th grade) located in Richmond, Virginia. A program of coordination with nearby St. Catherine's School allows a broader selection of courses at the Upper School level, taught in coeducational classes on both campuses. The school puts emphasis on its honor code and on the importance of community, as well as educating "the whole boy" through athletics, the arts, and morning chapel.


== History ==
Dr. Churchill Gibson Chamberlayne founded St. Christopher's School in 1911 as The Chamberlayne School. On June 11, 1920, a system of church schools was established by the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, at which time The Chamberlayne School was renamed St. Christopher's School.


== Athletics ==
St. Christopher's School belongs to two athletic associations, the Virginia Prep League and the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association (VISAA). St. Christopher's has longstanding athletic rivalries with Benedictine High School, Collegiate School and Woodberry Forest School.
The wrestling program, considered one of the best in Virginia, held a streak of 11 consecutive Prep League and state VISAA championships.

== History ==
In 2008, a group of parents joined together to discuss the possibility of setting up an alternative school for their children. Each of these children had faced their own challenges during primary school and their parents felt that they would benefit from a "smaller, more intimate and less pressurised" learning environment.Initially, the school started off in a house on Harry Pichanick Road, New Alexandra Park, transforming bedrooms and living rooms into classrooms, a staff room and an administration office. The school then moved to its present site. In 2009, the school accepted its first class of eight students. At first, the policy was to keep its class size at ten pupils maximum but due to demand determined by entrance examinations for Form One, the school increased its class size to twelve pupils.In 2013, the school had its first class of Form Fours (Year 10), writing IGCSEs.


== Academics ==
Pupils from Form 1 to Upper 6 are taught in classes of no more than 12 children. The IGCSE, AS Level and A Level syllabuses developed and examined by Cambridge International Examinations are followed in all subjects with much greater attention given to detail and individual differences, needs and abilities.The subjects offered are:

The World Health Organization received advice on nursing from a number of bodies, particularly its Expert Nursing Committees. The first, in 1950, had both Udell, and another nurse, Olive Baggallay, as members, and made a series of statements, which were to be echoed, in one form or another, over several decades.

Nurses are needed in greater numbers than other categories of health workers because they have direct, individualized, and lasting contact with people, sick and well. In this sense, nurses are the final agents of health services ... the stage of development of nursing varies greatly from culture to culture...

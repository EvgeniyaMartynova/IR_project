Vimy House

Vimy House is a warehouse in western Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, that used to store most of the collection of the Canadian War Museum.  Originally built as Ottawa's streetcar garage, it was turned over to the war museum when its Sussex Drive building ran out of storage and office space.  The building is filled with a vast array of aged military paraphernalia, from large tanks down to many thousands of medals.  It is also home to the world's largest collection of Canadian war art.  While items from the Vimy House collection would occasionally be put on display at the museum itself, the public could also visit Vimy House on special open house days and tour its collection.
In 2005, the new War Museum at LeBreton Flats was opened.  This war museum has enough room for storage, and the Vimy House property was sold.  The last open house was held on September 6, 2003.

The original music video was focused around Amanda and Brian making love in a hotel room. While undressing each other they notice various names of other people (including Tommy Lee, PJ Harvey, Tori Amos and Spencer Smith) tattooed to their partner's body. They become more and more jealous and enraged to the point that they attempt to kill each other. This is interspersed with shots of the band performing the song.
The second music video for this single featured the band Panic! at the Disco. Panic's members are friends of The Dresden Dolls. While on tour with them, Panic's lead singer Brendon Urie occasionally performed "...Baby One More Time" on stage with The Dresden Dolls.
This music video was shot, cut, and directed by Michael Pope.

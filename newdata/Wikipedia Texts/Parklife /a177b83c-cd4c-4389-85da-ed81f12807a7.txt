Parklife (festival)

Parklife is an independent music festival held annually in Manchester, England, co-founded by Sacha Lord. It started life as Mad Ferret Festival in Platt Fields Park, Rusholme, before moving to Heaton Park in north Manchester in 2012 in order to accommodate the increased numbers attending. It is jointly organised by a number of groups, including The Warehouse Project. In 2018, the festival was headlined by the xx and Liam Gallagher. This music festival is a two-day non- camping festival.

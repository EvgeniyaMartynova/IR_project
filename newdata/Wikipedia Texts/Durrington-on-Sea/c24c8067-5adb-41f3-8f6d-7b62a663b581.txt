Durrington-on-Sea railway station

Durrington-on-Sea railway station is in Goring, a suburb of Worthing in the county of West Sussex. It is 12 miles 13 chains (19.6 km) down the line from Brighton. The station is operated by Southern.
It is situated extremely close to the headquarters of West Sussex Primary Care NHS Trust and a large HM Revenue and Customs office.
It was designed in the Modernist style by the architect to the Southern Railway, James Robb Scott and opened on 4 July 1937.  The architecture and design of station has drawn criticism from locals as the "grimmest stop in the South", but owners (Network Rail) and operator (Southern), refute claims of problems and cite lack of central government funding to rebuild stations. Facilities at the station are limited - there is no enclosed waiting room or toilets.
The brick structure on top of the main station building, used to house a diesel generator as backup to power the train lines. It is only accessible via a small ladder from the roof. The structure now sits empty.

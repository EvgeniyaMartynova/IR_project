George Warren was born in Topsham, Devon about 1801. He joined the Honourable East India Company's 1st Bengal European Regiment (which, much later after several mergers, became the Royal Munster Fusiliers) and was stationed in India. On 4 March 1823, Lieutenant Warren arrived in Madras aboard HMS Warren Hastings. On 18 January 1826, he took part in the Storming of the Jungeena Gate at Bhurtpore. On 16 March 1839, as a Brigadier, he described  the soldiers' appearance during the passage of the Bolan Pass as an army retreating under every disaster; public stores and private property lying about scattered and abandoned in every direction

On 17 September of the same year, he was awarded the Order of the Dooranee Empire, 3rd class. He progressed quickly to the rank of General and remained in India until the early 1860s. He retired to the United Kingdom, firstly to Sudley Lodge, South Bersted, Sussex, and then to Portsea, Portsmouth and Southsea, where he died.
His medals from the 1839 campaign are in the Watson Medal Collection (Afghan War), Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.

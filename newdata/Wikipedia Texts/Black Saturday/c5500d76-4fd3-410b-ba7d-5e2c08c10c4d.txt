Massacre of the Sixty

The Massacre of the Sixty, or Black Saturday (Amharic: ጥቁሩ ቅዳሜ, tikuru kidami), took place in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) on the morning of 23 November 1974 (Ethiopian calendar: 14 Hidar 1967), when 60 imprisoned former government officials were executed by the Derg at Kerchele Prison (commonly called Alem Bekagn - "Farewell to the World").
Ethiopia's revolution started about ten weeks before the massacre. Before this point, Derg was able to instill hope among the people, that the revolution could remain bloodless. Epitomised by the slogan "Ityopiya tikdem, yala mimin dem” — “Let Ethiopia progress, without any bloodshed”.The massacre presaged the Red Terror and Ethiopian Civil War that would follow in years after.

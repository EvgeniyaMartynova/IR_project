Maat Kheru

Maa Kheru (Ancient Egyptian: mꜣꜥ ḫrw) is a phrase meaning "true of voice" or "justified" or "the acclaim given to him is 'right'". The term is involved in ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs, according to which deceased souls had to be judged morally righteous. Once the soul had passed the test, the Weighing of the Heart, he or she was judged to be mꜣꜥ ḫrw and was allowed to enter the afterlife. The phrase was often used to denote someone who had passed and become a god by placing it at the end of the name of the individual in question.

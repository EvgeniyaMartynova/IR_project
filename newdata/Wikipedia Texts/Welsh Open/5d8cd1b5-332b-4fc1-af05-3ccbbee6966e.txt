Wales Open

The Wales Open was a professional golf tournament on the European Tour. It was founded in 2000 and played annually through 2014. The event was hosted at the Celtic Manor Resort in the city of Newport, South Wales, also the venue for the 2010 Ryder Cup. The tournament was originally played over the resort's Wentwood Hills course, through 2004. While that course was being redeveloped for the Ryder Cup, the Wales Open was played for three years (2005–07) on the Roman Road course, a par-69 venue. Since 2008, the event has been played on the Ryder Cup Twenty-Ten course. The tournament has previously been known as the Saab Wales Open and the Celtic Manor Wales Open due to past sponsorship deals.
ISPS Handa (International Sports Promotion Society) became the title sponsor in 2012 and the prize fund that year was £1.8 million.

In 2006, Sweden's Robert Karlsson broke the European Tour's 36-hole and 54-hole scoring records by shooting 124 for the first two rounds and 189 for the first three. However, as the Roman Road course was a par-69, rare at the professional level, his to-par scores were slightly less remarkable 14-under after two rounds and 18-under after three. Karlsson shot two-over-par for the final round, but still won. In the same year, Phillip Archer posted a score of 60 in the first round, which would have been a 59 but for a missed birdie putt on the 18th green.

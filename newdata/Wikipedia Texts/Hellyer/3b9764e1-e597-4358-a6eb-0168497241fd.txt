Hellyer Gorge

The Hellyer Gorge is a gorge in Tasmania, through which flows the Hellyer River, named after Henry Hellyer. It is the subject of the Hellyer Gorge State Reserve. The Murchison Highway passes through the area with many sharp and steep bends, which provides the setting to a stage of Targa Tasmania. Being subject to black ice, this portion of road has now been bypassed by the newer Ridgley Highway. Nevertheless, the area is quite picturesque and some bush-walking tracks have been blazed for tourists.

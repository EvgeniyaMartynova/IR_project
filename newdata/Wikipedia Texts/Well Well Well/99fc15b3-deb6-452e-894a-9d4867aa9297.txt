== Reception ==
Feminist Sweepstakes has been generally well received by critics, and currently holds an approval rating of 78/100 on review aggregator website Metacritic.Mojo reviewer called it "Protest music that doesn't protest too much â€“ a music with such a joy and wit to its outrage that it acquires a universality beyond its subject matter." Uncut called it "The catchiest lesson in sexual politics you're likely to hear this season". Alternative Press wrote "This is still some of the most original, passionate and listenable music of the year".Slightly less favourable was Allison Fields of Pitchfork, who wrote "Feminist Sweepstakes wants to be a terrifically fun album, yet with no deviation from the ceaseless politics and endless drum machine beats, things go stale." Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club wrote "Hanna is a crafty writer who can give song lyrics the weight of a master's thesis, but she often sounds tired and resigned this time out" and that the album "suggests a band less inspired by its own purpose."

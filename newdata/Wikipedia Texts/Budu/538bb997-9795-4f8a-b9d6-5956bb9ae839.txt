Budu Dogon

Budu Dogon or Bunoge, also known as Korandabo, is a recently discovered Dogon language spoken in Mali. It was first reported online.[1] The plural suffix on nouns is closest to Kolum so, suggesting it should be classified as a West Dogon language.
The people call themselves Budu, and Tɔmmɔ-sɔ speakers call the language Budu-sɔ. It has also been called Budu-Tagu, the name of the principal Budu village.

== History ==
The Buckleys first moved to Northwest Indiana in 1849, where they built their first farmstead. The Buckleys were Irish immigrants who moved to the United States in the mid-18th century. The Buckleys ended up turning their farm into a 150-head dairy farm. They sold their milk to markets in Chicago during the early 20th century. Over four generations, the farm grew from 79 acres (32 ha) to 520 acres (210 ha). In 1977, part of the park was donated by Rose Buckley Pearce to be part of the Lake County Parks. The Buckley Homestead was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.


== Features ==
Next to the parking area, there is a visitor center which contains restroom facilities, drinking fountains, information kiosk, and a gift shop which is open on Sunday afternoons from May through the first of August. After that, a path will lead to the Buckley's farm. The park is divided into sections: Main House Museum, School, Pioneer Farm, and Back Again.

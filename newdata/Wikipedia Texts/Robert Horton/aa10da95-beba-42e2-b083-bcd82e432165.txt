== Early life ==
One of two sons, Horton was born as Meade Howard Horton Jr. on July 29, 1924, in Los Angeles, California. He was the son of Meade Howard Horton and Chetta McMurrin.Horton said that he never felt he fitted into his proper Mormon household because at times he was rather impetuous.. He survived several surgeries in childhood, including hernia repair and treatment for an enlarged kidney. Horton attended California Military Institute in Perris, where he played football. After graduation in 1943 at age 19, he enlisted in the Coast Guard, but was medically discharged because of his kidney. (The accuracy of the preceding graduation information might be questioned. The page linked to the citation does not name the school, and a document on the California Military Institute's website indicates that it began operation in 2003. In contrast, the book From Small Screen to Vinyl: A Guide to Television Stars Who Made Records, 1950-2000 by Bob Leszczak says of Horton, "He graduated from Hollywood High School in 1942.")In 1945, a chance encounter with the talent scout led to an uncredited part in Lewis Milestone's film A Walk in the Sun (1945). He first studied dramatics at the University of Miami but later changed schools and graduated cum laude from UCLA. He relocated from California to New York City, where he worked as a struggling actor, before returning to California. At age 28, Horton signed a contract with MGM, appearing in films. It was there where he met younger actors Robert Fuller and James Drury, who both became Horton's lifelong friends.

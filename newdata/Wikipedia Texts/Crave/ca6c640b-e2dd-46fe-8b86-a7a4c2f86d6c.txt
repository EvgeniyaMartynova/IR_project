Crave (song)

"Crave" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna and American rapper Swae Lee. It was released on May 10, 2019, as the second single from Madonna's fourteenth studio album Madame X. It was written by Madonna, Lee, and Starrah, and was produced by Madonna, Billboard, and Mike Dean.


== Background ==
Madonna stated in an interview backstage at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards that it was one of the first songs she wrote for the album and that the song is about "desire and longing" and she wanted to sing with a man on the track. On working with Swae Lee, Madonna said: "He's really talented...I think he's a great writer, a great singer and he's so cute. Cute's important."


== Composition ==
"Crave" is a midtempo pop and trap ballad featuring acoustic guitar, hand-clap beat, and Madonna's plaintive vocals. On a radio interview with Mario Lopez she described the song as "angst-driven" and "chasing after [someone who is] running away".


== Critical reception ==
Rolling Stone called the song a "sultry pop number about hungering for another person". NME's El Hunt compared it to Lisbon’s traditional Fado music, calling it a "breezy, low-key moment which nods vaguely back towards the heartbreak of her 1989 album Like a Prayer, and yet sounds nothing like it". Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass felt it was "the third and (easily) most commercial cut from Madame X [...] a sexy, mid-tempo groove, it evokes the Hard Candy era, but the tone here is mellower and more romantic", ultimately concluding that "if radio didn’t ignore Madonna’s entire existence, it would sound perfect on pop and rhythmic formats".According to Variety's Jeremy Helligar, "the white-girl hip-hop of 'Crave' wouldn’t sound out of place on Ariana Grande’s latest album". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine opined that "when Madonna isn’t singing with what sounds like a mouthful of gumballs [on 'Crave'], the rawness of her voice amplifies the nakedness of her lyrics". Chris DeVille from Stereogum deemed it "a misty ballad that makes Madonna emoting over trap drum programming sound like the most natural thing in the world". From Gay Star News, Jamie Tabberer was more critical; "featuring twangy guitars and gentle rap from Swae Lee, this languid ode to obsessive love [...] is too indistinct, and the delivery is wishy-washy". Similarly, Rich Juzwiak from Pitchfork described the song as "a naked attempt to score Madonna her own 'We Belong Together'”, denouncing her delivery as being "flat as denial".


== Chart performance ==
The song achieved her highest debut on the Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart in the United States, launching at number 19 on the June 8-dated tally. It became her 37th entry on the chart and her second appearance for this decade after "Ghosttown" in 2015, from her thirteenth studio album Rebel Heart.  The next week, the song climbed to number 15, becoming the "most added" song of the week. It then climbed to its current peak of 11, becoming Madonna's largest hit on the AC chart since "Frozen" in 1998. The song also reached a peak of 34 on the Billboard's Adult Pop Songs chart in the US, becoming her 21st entry on the chart and her largest hit there since "Give Me All Your Luvin'" in 2012. "Crave" became Madonna's record extending 49th number one on the Dance Club Songs chart on the chart dated November 16.In the United Kingdom, on the official sales only chart (which does not include audio or digital streams), the single peaked at number 51, spending one week on the chart.The "Crave Remixes Pt.1" EP reached number 49 in the US ITunes charts and 41 in the UK.


== Music video ==
The music video for "Crave" is directed by Nuno Xico and premiered on May 22, 2019.It begins with haunting lines spoken by Madonna about her waiting for an unreciprocating lover, a feeling which she describes as "dangerous." It takes place in an empty New York City building. Throughout the video Madonna sends love notes to Swae Lee via carrier pigeons, ending with the pair releasing more pigeons on the rooftop, and finally reaching out to each other's hands surged with electricity, reminiscent of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam.

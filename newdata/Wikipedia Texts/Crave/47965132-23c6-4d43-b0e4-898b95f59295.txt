Craving (album)

The Craving is the only album released by MD.45, which was a side project of Megadeth guitarist/frontman Dave Mustaine, along with Fear guitarist/vocalist Lee Ving on singing duties, bassist Kelly LeMieux and former Suicidal Tendencies and Alice Cooper drummer Jimmy DeGrasso.  The album has been released in two versions: the original with Ving on vocals released on July 23, 1996 on Slab Records and the remaster with Dave Mustaine on vocals in 2004 on Capitol Records.
Mustaine described the album (via the liner notes on the remastered CD) as "a punk metal record, warts and all."  Mustaine also notes that his vocal range is not as "soulful" as Lee's.  "I sang them for Lee, now I'm singing them for you."Mustaine has stated that he replaced the original vocal tracks with his own to "entice interest from Megadeth fans who might have overlooked the original."

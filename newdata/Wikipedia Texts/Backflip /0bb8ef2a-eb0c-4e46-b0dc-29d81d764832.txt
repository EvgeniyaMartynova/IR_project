I'm with this guy and he's just being disrespectful to me. I'm coming in the house trying to offer him popcorn and he's throwing it all over me, talking on the phone [when] we're supposed to be having some quality time together. So through all of this I'm just typing on my Blackberry and writing something down mischievously and we don't know what's going on... Anyway, we find out that I'm reprogramming him, kinda like 'Stepford Husbands,' making him a little more respectful, loving and [willing to] listen some more, not necessarily catering just to me, but come on now, let's be serious.

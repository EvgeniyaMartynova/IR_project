Motorola Backflip

The Motorola Backflip (also called the Motorola Motus in some regions) is a touchscreen smartphone released to the U.S. for the AT&T Mobility network on March 7, 2010, and for other countries on Telus and Optus networks. It runs the open source Google Android software.


== General features ==
The phone is built on the Android platform 1.5.Motorola features Motoblur, which integrates multiple social network service sites on the homescreen. This cannot be uninstalled or disabled unless the phone is modified.
It has a full QWERTY keypad with a "reverse flip" design. When the device is closed and the screen is visible to the user, the reverse side is the keypad itself. Opening the device causes the screen to flip so that it rests above the keypad.

== Applications ==
Users may customize their phones by installing apps through the Android Market; however, some carriers (AT&T) do not give users the option to install non-market apps onto the Backflip (a policy they have continued with all of their Android phones). This has created some controversy with users, as the non-market apps are often seen as a useful way to expand a phone's capabilities. Users can circumvent this limitation by manually installing 3rd party apps using the tools included with the SDK while the handset is connected to a computer.


== Reviews ==
Reviews are generally mixed to unfavorable. Michael Oryl, of "Mobileburn.com," likes the "Backtrack" trackpad on the back of the phone, but points out that large hands often activate it accidentally. Victor Godinez, of The Dallas Morning News, suggests that the phone is aimed towards social networkers, and points out that the price is higher than other options with additional features such as the iPhone.


== System upgrades ==
On November 9, 2010, a downloadable update,  Android OS 2.1 (Eclair) and a compatible version of MotoBlur was released by Motorola for AT&T Backflip customers, U.S. only. The update is unavailable over-the-air (OTA).
Since then Eclair is available for phones outside U.S. that are rooted with custom recoveries installed and radio updated. CyanogenMod 7.2 (Android 2.3.7) is available through official releases. Other custom roms are also available.


=== Overclocking ===
Overclocking is possible via overclocking kernels and direct overclocking. Overclocking is available up to 768 MHz on the official cyanogenmod 7 rom.


=== Multitouch ===
Since this phone lacks the multitouch feature, a patch was made available for the froyo rom. However many testers have reported problems with the touchscreen which becomes jerky and eventually ceases to operate.

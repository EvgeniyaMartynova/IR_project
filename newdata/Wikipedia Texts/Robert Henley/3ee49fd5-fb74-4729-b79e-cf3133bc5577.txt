Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington

Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington, PC (c. 1708 – 14 January 1772) was the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. He was a member of the Whig Party in the parliament and was known for his wit and writing.


== Family ==
Born the second son of Anthony Henley, Robert Henley was from a wealthy family in Hampshire. His grandfather, Sir Robert Henley, had been Master of the Court of the King's Bench, essentially a defence counsel. 
Henley's father Anthony Henley was educated at Oxford and interested in literature. When he moved to London, he became the friend of the Earls of Dorset and Sunderland, as well as a friend of Swift, Pope, and Burnet. After becoming a married man, Anthony Henley had been the Member of Parliament for Andover  in 1698. He died in August, 1711 and was succeeded in turn by his eldest son, Anthony and his second son, Robert.


== Early life ==

Henley was educated at Westminster School and attended St. John's College in Oxford. He gained a fellowship at the All Souls College in 1727, entered the Inner Temple to study law in 1729 and was called to the bar on 23 June 1732. He succeeded his elder brother in 1746, inheriting The Grange, Northington in Hampshire which had been built for his grandfather by Inigo Jones. 


== Career ==
He was elected a Member of Parliament for Bath in 1747 and became Recorder of the town in 1751. He was appointed Attorney General and knighted in 1756 and promoted the next year to Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, the last person to receive this title. Although as Lord Keeper he presided over the House of Lords, he was not made a peer until 1760 when he became Baron Henley of Grange in the County of Southampton. When George III ascended to power, Henley was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain in 1761 and made Earl of Northington in 1764.The delay in raising him to the peerage was due to the hostility of George II, who resented Henley's former support of the Prince of Wales's faction, known as the Leicester House party; and it was in order that he might preside as Lord High Steward at the trial of the Earl Ferrers for murder in 1760 that he then received his patent. He resigned from his position in 1767 and died at his residence in Hampshire on 14 January 1772.


== Personal life ==
In 1743, Henley had married Jane Huband who was the daughter of Sir John Huband of Ipsley of Warwickshire. He had three sons and five daughters. The names of his daughters were: Lady Catherine Henley (d. 9 Jan 1779); Lady Bridget Henley (d. 13 March 1796), married Robert Lane; Jane Henley (d. February 1823); Lady Elizabeth Henley (d. 20 August 1821); Mary Henley (1753–1814).He was succeeded by his son Robert Henley, 2nd Earl of Northington.

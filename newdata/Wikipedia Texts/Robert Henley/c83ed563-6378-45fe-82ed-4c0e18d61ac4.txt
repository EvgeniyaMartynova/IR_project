Born in Williamsburg, Virginia and educated at the College of William and Mary, Robert Henley was the son of Leonard and Elizabeth Dandridge Henley and the nephew of Martha Dandridge Custis Washington.

With the end of the War of 1812, Henley filled a variety of billets before commanding Hornet against pirates in the West Indies. He captured the pirate schooner Moscow off Santo Domingo 29 October 1821. After serving as commandant of the Naval Rendezvous at Norfolk 1822 to 1824, he reported for similar duty at Charleston, South Carolina.

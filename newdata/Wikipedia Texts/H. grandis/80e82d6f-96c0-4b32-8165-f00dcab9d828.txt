Hierodula grandis

Hierodula is a genus of praying mantids in the tribe Paramantini, found throughout Asia. Many species are referred to by the common name giant Asian mantis because of their large size compared to other mantids. Their large size and vibrant coloration make Hierodula mantids popular in the pet trade. Some widespread species include H. grandis, H. membranacea and H. patellifera; however this has been considered a 'catch all' genus and is currently subject to review.

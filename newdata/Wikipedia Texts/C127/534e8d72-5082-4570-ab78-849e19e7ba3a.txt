Bellarine Highway

The Bellarine Highway runs east from Geelong in Victoria along the Bellarine Peninsula to Queenscliff. Previously assigned State Route 91, it was later designated as B110. On the other side of the bay at Sorrento route B110 resumes as Point Nepean Road and the Mornington Peninsula Freeway (south) until Mornington.
The Geelong end of the highway once ran along Ryrie Street in the Geelong city centre but was relocated a number of blocks south to Mackillop Street to remove heavy trucks from the shopping district. The highway provides the main route to Leopold which is located on the highway, and Ocean Grove which is located to the south. The road has been progressively duplicated as far as Grubb Road. The highway ends at Larkin Parade, Queenscliff where it meets the Peninsula Searoad Transport passenger and motor vehicle ferry which operates across Port Phillip Bay to Sorrento on the Mornington Peninsula.

Black Fire (album)

Black Fire is a studio album by American jazz pianist and composer Andrew Hill, released on Blue Note Records in 1964. It was Hill's debut for the label. Initially, Philly Joe Jones was scheduled to play on the album, but was replaced by Roy Haynes after scheduling issues. The Allmusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls the album "an impressive statement of purpose that retains much of its power decades after its initial release... a modern jazz classic."

Victoria Vistas

The Victoria Vistas were a Canadian soccer club in the original Canadian Soccer League. The Vistas joined the CSL for the 1989 season, and folded after the 1990 season.  Victoria All-star teams had been competitive with league champion Vancouver 86ers teams in pre-season contests during previous years.


== 1989 Season ==
The CSL in 1989 had a two player import rule and the more financially successful clubs attempted to sign primarily local players, so that the club didn't incur accommodation, transportation, and other ancillary costs for out-of-town players.  Robert Bolitho acted as the club's general manager.  The 1989 season started promisingly with a 2-2-2 record and second place in the CSL's Western Division; however, roadtrips to Eastern Canada interspersed with two home matches removed any momentum the club was generating.  Scorelines were close, typically one goal affairs, excepting an away match to league leaders Vancouver 86ers and a July 10â€“12 Hamilton/Ottawa road trip.  Victoria just wasn't getting results and August 1 coach Brian Hughes moved to Director of Player Development while Brian Wilson was announced as the primary coach.  Although results didn't really improve, during a match preview versus Winnipeg Fury, July 20, 1989, the Vistas were noted as averaging about 2,000 spectators per game.  The Vistas finished the season strongly boding well for the 1990 season.

South Carolina Gamecocks

The South Carolina Gamecocks represent the University of South Carolina in the NCAA Division I. This moniker is in honor of Thomas Sumter, a Revolutionary War hero from South Carolina who was nicknamed the "Carolina Gamecock" after British General Banastre Tarleton said Sumter "fought like a gamecock." While the men's teams were traditionally known as the Fighting Gamecocks and the women's teams were previously known as the Lady Gamecocks, this distinction was discontinued in part to eliminate any gender bias in the athletic department and in part to counter misconceptions about the gamecock mascot endorsing bloodsport.All of the University's varsity teams compete at the Division I level of the NCAA, and all but men's soccer and women's beach volleyball compete in the Southeastern Conference. Men's soccer competes in Conference USA and women's beach volleyball competes in the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association because the SEC does not sponsor those sports.
The athletic department is supported with private money from the Gamecock Club.  It was originally formed as the B.A.M. ("Buck-A-Month") Club in 1939 and 1940 to benefit the athletic programs from privately raised funds.The university's athletic programs have earned ten national team titles and produced many Olympians. Tim Brando (formerly of CBS Sports) was quoted as saying, "You won't find any more loyal fans in the country than those who follow the South Carolina Gamecocks."

=== Nickname and colors ===
"Garnet and black" have been used by the University of South Carolina as its colors ever since the family of J. William Flinn presented a banner composed of those colors to the football team in November 1895, although there was no official adoption of the colors at that time.  In 1900, the football team was first referred to as the "Gamecocks" by The State newspaper.  The nickname was a reference to the fighting tactics of General Thomas Sumter, the Revolutionary War hero known as the Carolina Gamecock.  Given that garnet and black were already in use and also the dominant colors on a gamecock, the university gradually adopted "Gamecocks" and "garnet and black" as the official nickname and colors for its athletic teams.


=== Conference history ===
The University of South Carolina was a member of the Southern Conference for men's basketball and football from 1922 until it became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953.  The Gamecocks left the ACC in 1971, following numerous disputes over the ACC's recruiting regulations and the political dominance of the conference's four North Carolina schools.  USC then competed as an independent until 1983 when it joined the Metro Conference for all sports except football (which the Metro did not sponsor) and men's soccer.  In 1991, the Gamecocks joined the Southeastern Conference when it increased its membership to 12 schools and split into two divisions.  Since joining the SEC, the Gamecocks have been part of the league's East Division.
Men's soccer continued to compete as an independent since the SEC does not sponsor men's soccer, but joined the Metro Conference for the 1993 and 1994 seasons and has competed in Conference USA since 2005.  Women's beach volleyball competed as an independent before joining the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association for the 2016 season (2015–16 school year).


== Sports sponsored ==
South Carolina sponsors team in 8 men's and 11 women's NCAA sanctioned sports. All programs compete in the Southeastern Conference with the exception of the men's soccer program which competes in Conference USA and the women's beach volleyball program competes in the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association.

== Rivalries ==

Carolina's foremost rival is Clemson University. The two institutions are separated by just over 125 miles (201 km) and have been bitter rivals since Clemson's founding in 1889. A heated rivalry continues to this day for a variety of reasons, including the historic tensions regarding their respective charters along with the passions surrounding their athletic programs. The annual Carolina-Clemson football game is the longest uninterrupted series in the South and the third longest uninterrupted series overall, first played in 1896 (four years after South Carolina's inaugural season), and played every year since 1909. Their baseball programs consistently qualify for the NCAA playoffs and frequently earn berths to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.
Carolina continues to develop rivalries with other members of the SEC's Eastern Division. Carolina's main SEC rival has been the University of Georgia due to its proximity and the many years of competition before the Gamecocks joined the SEC. The "Halloween Game" against the University of Tennessee has the potential to be a big football game every year.
When South Carolina was a member of the ACC (1953–1971), there was an intense rivalry with the University of North Carolina, particularly in basketball, since Frank McGuire had coached UNC but moved to Columbia to coach the Gamecocks. The rivalry was renewed in football during the 2007 season, with the Gamecocks defeating the Tar Heels 21-15.

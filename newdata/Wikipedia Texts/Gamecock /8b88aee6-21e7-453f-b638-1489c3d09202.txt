== History ==
What would contain the original Sumter High School high-school grades opened as the public Sumter Graded Schools of the town of Sumter, S. C. during racially segregated times for the fall semester of 1889 on 2 Sept. 1889 with 310 white students and 294 non-white students  with white boys of all grades separate in one building and girls in another and different location. Black students continued in the Lincoln School (which later became Lincoln High School). Over the subsequent decades of racial segregation, Sumter High School would become Edmunds High School beginning the fall semester of 1939. Dave Pettigrew, Sumter High School class of 1971, has created an on-line time-line of the evolution of Sumter High School.Sumter High School was officially founded in 1970 with the merging of the student bodies of the two racially segregated city schools, Lincoln High School and Edmunds High School. The Haynsworth Street Campus (Edmunds High) was for grades 11 and 12 while the Council Street Campus (Lincoln High) was for grade 10. The original school, built in 1925, was called "The Boys School" located on Haynsworth Street with "The Girls School" located on Calhoun Street. The Boys School and Girls School then became coeducational in 1939 on the Haynsworth  Street school and was named Edmunds High School in memory of Superintendent Samuel Henry Edmunds. The Girls School became Calhoun Junior High and then McLaurin Junior High in 1950 in memory of Superintendent Linnie McLaurin. The colors were purple and white. This color combination represented the merging of the two junior high schools: McLaurin Junior High School, whose colors were red and white, and Alice Drive Junior High (now Alice Drive Middle School), with colors blue and white. In 1970, when Lincoln and Edmunds High Schools integrated and were renamed Sumter High School, the colors became the current blue and gold. In 1975 McLaurin Junior High became the Sumter High McLaurin campus for grade 9 making Sumter High a three-campus system. In 1980, Sumter High abandoned the McLaurin campus and 9th grade was moved to the Council Street Campus with 10th grade until the opening of the new Sumter High School on McCrays Mill Road in 1983.
The current location on McCrays Mill Road was opened in 1983 for grades 10 to 12, with the
Haynsworth Street Campus for grade 9. Since opening, Sumter High has undergone many expansions and renovations. First expansion came in 1985 in what is now known as B Hall math department which opened in 1987. In 1987, grade 9 from the Haynsworth Street campus was moved to McCrays Mill Road. Then in 1987 expansion for C hall computer and social studies started and was completed in 1989, making Sumter High the largest high school in South Carolina. Again in 2003 a new main entrance and office was built, a second gym, new science wing and a new auditorium for the arts; the 2003 additions opened to students in fall 2005 for the Class of 2006. The 2003 renovations included a new guidance office and attendance office and renovations of science classes. Then in 2014 a new floor and new tables were added to the commons.
On July 1, 2011, Sumter School Districts 17 and 2 were consolidated into Sumter School District.

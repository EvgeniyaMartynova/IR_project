Robert Haas (clergyman)

Robert Haas was a nineteenth-century Lutheran minister, who advocated the civil equality of Jews in Germany. Active in the Duchy of Nassau, he counted Reform Jewish leader Abraham Geiger  among his friends, and endorsed the 1837 rabbinical convention in Wiesbaden. That same year, he produced a circular addressed to "all Christians in Germany," calling on them to assist in the establishment of a faculty of Jewish studies at a German university. He published several works, most notably Das Staatsb√ºrgertum der Juden vom Standpunkt der Inneren Politik.

Donga was the subject of a viral video involving a scene featuring the film's musical number "Golimar" ("Shoot the Bullet"). The scene contains choreography and elements from Michael Jackson's Thriller music video (which leads to the common nickname for the video, "Indian Thriller") and has become a widely seen video on YouTube.A further parody of the scene by Mike Sutton (Buffalax) titled "Indian Thriller with English lyrics" added subtitles to the video phonetically approximating the original lyrics as English sentences; resulting in "Golimar" being misinterpreted as "Girly man", and producing such lines as "Nippley man I met, he ate motorboat!", "I'll eat wasabi on my dude", and "You'll be pumping Ovaltine." He has also produced similar spoofs with other songs, including "Benny Lava", a spoof of a song from the Tamil film Pennin Manathai Thottu. Since its release, American dubstep artist Skrillex has used short portions of the video for live performances. It is seen as the background for a remix of "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites" titled, "Scary Bolly Dub".

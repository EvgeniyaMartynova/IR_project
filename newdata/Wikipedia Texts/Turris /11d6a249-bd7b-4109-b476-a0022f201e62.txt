The Turris Omnia is designed to provide its owner with freedom in use. As such it uses open-source software. In addition, the creators published the electrical schematics.It also incorporates several security measures. It features automated software updates, so software vulnerabilities can be addressed quickly, a unique feature among SOHO routers. It also enables DNSSEC by default and also allows people to easily participate in distributed adaptive firewall which tries to automatically identify attackers by collecting data from numerous sources.
Apart from that, the router yields a sufficient performance that it can handle gigabit traffic and double as home server, NAS and print server.

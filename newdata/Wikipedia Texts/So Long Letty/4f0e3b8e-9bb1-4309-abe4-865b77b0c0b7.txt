== Plot ==
Harry Miller (Barnes) is a party boy who loves the cabaret scene and nights on the town while his wife Grace is a homebody, distressed by her husband's errant ways. Their neighbors are the opposite. Tommy Robbins (Walter Hiers) likes domestic life and home cooking while his wife Letty (Darmond) is devoted to the wild life. Harry and Tommy hatch a plan to solve their problems; that they divorce their wives and swap. The wives overhear the plan and go along with the suggestion, though following a plan of their own. They suggest a week-long trial period of platonic marriage, during which the wives do all they can to make their new potential mates miserable. In the end the husbands are happy with the wives who they have married.

== Release and reception ==
The film premiered on October 16, 1929.  Film historian Scott Eyman, in his book The Speed of Sound, wrote that the film was one of a wave of more than 70 musicals inundating American movie theaters in 1930.  Like most of its genre at the time, it was financially disappointing and "barely broke even", despite the "glorious rowdy Charlotte Greenwood", Eyman said.

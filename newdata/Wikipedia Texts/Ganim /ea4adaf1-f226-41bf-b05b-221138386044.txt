Ir Ganim

Ir Ganim (Hebrew: עיר גנים, "city of gardens") is a neighborhood in southwest Jerusalem, bordering Kiryat Menachem.


== History ==
Planning for Ir Ganim began in 1953. It was designed for a population of 8,000-10,000 new immigrants on 1,577 dunams of land. The first 500 housing units were built by the Rassco company employing a higher standard of building than other new immigrant neighborhoods. Each home had a private garden. Ir Ganim Aleph  was established in 1957. Before moving to Ir Ganim, most of the residents had been living in maabarot (transit camps).  Some of the land was  owned by the Jewish National Fund and the rest was provided by the Israel Lands Administration.

The population of Ir Ganim neighborhood is diverse, including both native Israelis and immigrants from Ethiopia and Russia.  It is considered a poor neighborhood, but has wealthier sections, such as Ir Ganim Aleph, overlooking the Judean Mountains. Kibbutz Reisheet, an urban kibbutz, is located in Ir Ganim.

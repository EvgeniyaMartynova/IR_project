== History ==
Purple House was formally established in 2002. It followed the auction of a series of collaborative paintings by Pintupi people from the Western Desert of Central Australia. Artists, many of whom were represented by Papunya Tula, were responding to an impending health crisis. Remote Indigenous people are up to twenty times more likely to experience end-stage kidney failure than non-Indigenous people. Throughout the 1990s, increasing numbers of Aboriginal people were being forced to leave their traditional lands for end-stage renal failure. Many required dialysis which meant permanent relocation to regional centres such as Alice Springs or Darwin. The paintings raised over $1 million dollars at an auction at the Art Gallery of NSW in 2000 which funded the established of Western Desert Nganampa Walytja Palyantjaku Tjutaku Aboriginal Corporation.It began dialysis services in a suburban house in Alice Springs, which was painted purple, inspiring its name Purple House. Its first remote dialysis clinic in Kintore opened in 2004. It now runs 13 other clinics and a mobile dialysis unit called the Purple Truck, based mainly on philanthropic funding. Three new clinics are expected to open in 2019, including Purple House's first South Australia clinic.After years of lobbying, in 2018 it was announced that dialysis in very remote areas would be funded by Medicare.

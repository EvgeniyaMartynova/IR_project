== Name ==
Kamnik was attested in 1143 as Stein (and as Stain in 1147 and Steine in 1205). The Slovene name was originally *Kam(en)ьnikъ, derived from the adjective form of the noun *kamy (accusative *kamenь) 'stone', referring to rocky terrain. The name of the settlement was changed from Kamnik to Kamnik pod Krimom (literally, 'Kamnik below Mount Krim') in 1953.


== Church ==
The local church, built in the centre of the village, is dedicated to Saint Florian and belongs to the Parish of Preserje. It was first mentioned in written documents dating to 1526, but was restyled in the 18th century.

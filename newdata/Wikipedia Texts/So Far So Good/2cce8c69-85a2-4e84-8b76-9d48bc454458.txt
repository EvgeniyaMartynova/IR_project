Anthology (Bryan Adams album)

Anthology is a compilation album by Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams which contains songs he recorded from 1978 through 2005. The two-disc set includes songs from 1980 to 2005. A third disc which was a DVD live concert which was recorded in mid-2005 called "Live in Lisbon" was included in North America for a limited time. All the songs are in chronological order of their release, except the last song on the first disc on the North American edition, which was released in 1999. The album's enclosed booklet has notes about the process of the recordings and the credits for each track.


== Release and reception ==
Anthology, co-produced by Adams, Robert John "Mutt" Lange and Bob Clearmountain, peaked at number 65 on the Billboard 200. The album was released on October 18, 2005 peaking at number 4 on the Canadian Album Chart and at number 29 on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified two times platinum in Canada and gold in the UK.


== Version differences ==
On the first disc, the North American edition has "The Best of Me" as the last track, while the International edition moved the song to the 2nd disc, and had "All I Want Is You" instead.
On the second disc, the North American edition has two songs from his album Room Service and a re-recorded version of "When You're Gone" with Pamela Anderson instead of Mel C.. 
While the international edition replaces the two Room Service Tracks with a new song "I'm Not the Man You Think I Am" (from the movie Colour Me Kubrick) and "Don't Give Up" (a collaboration  with Chicane), and the original version of "When You're Gone" with Mel C. instead of the new version.
The original 2-disc North American edition was remastered and reissued September 18, 2007.
Anthology contains a new song, "So Far So Good". It appears as the final track on the second disc in the North American release of the album (and second-to-last in international versions). Originally this song was to be the final song of the album of the same name but was scrapped. According to the enclosed booklet of Anthology, "So Far So Good" was recorded in the same session as "Please Forgive Me" in 1993 and remained incomplete until the release of Anthology in 2005.

Parmenides Foundation

The Parmenides Foundation was founded by Albrecht von MÃ¼ller in 2000 to support interdisciplinary research on thinking.
The foundation has an international faculty of more than 30 researchers from the fields of neurosciences, philosophy, neuroinformatics, cognitive psychology, linguistics, evolutionary anthropology.
Part of the research faculty focusses on two areas: developing an integrative conceptual framework and testing respective hypotheses via various imaging techniques (especially fMRI, EEG and NIRS) as well as in complementary behavioural studies.
The foundation is a cooperative partner of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and its researchers collaborate with the faculties of experimental and developmental psychology, philosophy, and medicine.
The foundation sells Parmenides EIDOS Suite, which is a derivative of the Think Tools Suite of the now defunct Think Tools AG.

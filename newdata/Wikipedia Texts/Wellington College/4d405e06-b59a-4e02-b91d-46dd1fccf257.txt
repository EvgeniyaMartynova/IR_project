Wellington College Belfast (better known as Wellington College or WCB) is a co-educational grammar school located in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The most recent principal was Nicola Connery. The school was formed when, in 1989, the all-boys' Annadale Grammar School and the all-girls' Carolan Grammar School merged to become a single co-educational school.

Wellington College was founded in 1989 after Annadale Boys and Carolan Girls merged. The school is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. The school moved to its current location on Carolan Road in 2002, which included 2 new rugby pitches, a gravel pitch, an astro pitch and a running track.

Teachers involved:

Yvonne Johnston (Head of Science)
David Cardwell

Christopher Lynn, Jordan Knocker and Mitchell McKee were in the team. The boys conducted an experiment on how to cut down litter in the school. In October 2010, they found out they had got through to the final in the RDS in Dublin. In January, the three boys went to Dublin with science teacher Stephen Wilson, as David Cardwell was unable to attend on the first day and Yvonne Johnston had work in school. David Cardwell was in Dublin for the second and third day of the competition and Yvonne Johnston attended the exhibition on the final day. The boys' exhibition was on feature in the school foyer from January 2011 to April 2011, after which it was placed safely in storage. The exhibition was re-displayed in Science Lab 102 in August 2011.

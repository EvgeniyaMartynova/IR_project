=== Controversy ===
The CBC was successfully sued for libel over an episode that aired on February 27, 1996.  Two doctors were interviewed for an episode about prescription drugs. Both doctors alleged their interviews were unfairly edited to give the false impression they were involved in kickbacks, coverups of patient deaths and other disreputable activities. Cardiologist Martin Meyers asked for an apology plus $25,000, while researcher Frans Leenen asked for an apology plus $10,000. The CBC opted to fight the charges in court. The doctors ultimately prevailed. Myers was awarded $200,000, plus interest and costs, while Leenen won $950,000, plus interest and costs that could total over $2 million, a record for Canadian libel. The CBC has no libel insurance. Judges in both cases ruled that journalists at The Fifth Estate had twisted the facts and acted with malice, with one writing in his decision; this was sensationalistic journalism of the worst sort and should serve as an embarrassment to this so-called 'flagship' investigative programme. The episode's host Trish Wood, producer Nicholas Regush, the researcher and executive producer David Studer were assessed punitive and aggravated damages.The CBC and The Fifth Estate were sued by the Iglesia Ni Cristo after officials said a November 11, 2018 broadcast, "Church of Secrets", defamed their church.

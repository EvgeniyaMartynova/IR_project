Craigmont, Idaho

Craigmont is a city in the northwest United States in Lewis County, Idaho. Located on the Camas Prairie in north central Idaho, it is within the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. The population was 501 at the 2010 census, down from 556 in 2000.


== History ==
The city is named for Colonel William Craig (1809–69), a mountain man who had a Nez Perce wife.  He settled at Lapwai near his father-in-law Hin-mah-tute-ke-kaikt or James in 1840 when he gave up being a fur trapper due to the collapse of the market for beaver.The Nez Perce Reservation was opened to white settlement 124 years ago in 1895, and a town named "Chicago," a mile west of the current Craigmont, was founded in 1898.  In response to not getting their mail from the post office, it was renamed "Ilo" four years later, after Ilo Leggett, daughter of town founder and merchant W.O. Leggett.  A fire burnt the town in 1904 and shortly thereafter the Camas Prairie Railroad bypassed the town and started a settlement, platted by Lewiston financier John P. Vollmer, on the northeast side of the railroad tracks, and he named it "Vollmer."  Ilo responded and moved its community to the southwest side of the tracks, adjacent to Vollmer.  After a decade-long feud and the consolidation of the school districts, the communities merged in 1920 to become Craigmont.

The largest is the massive century-old steel trestle, 1,488 feet (454 m) in length and its track 287 feet (87 m) above the creek.

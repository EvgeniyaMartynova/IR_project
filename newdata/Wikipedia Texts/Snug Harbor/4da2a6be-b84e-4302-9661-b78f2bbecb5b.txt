All 5 seats on the town council are at-large seats that are up for election every 2 years, with no term limits. After each election, the newly elected council members elect two of their own as president and vice president. Quite often (but not always, and not currently), these are the two highest vote-getters in the previous election. The current president is Abel G. Collins (I), and the current vice president is Bryant C. Da Cruz (D).
The town's citizens also elect a 7-member school committee. Committee members are elected to staggered 4-year terms, with 4 seats typically up for election in U.S. Presidential election years and the other 3 typically up for election in midterm election years. The current chair is Stephanie Canter (D) and the current vice chair is Sarah Markey (D).

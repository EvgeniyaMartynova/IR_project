It features live performances by both noted local and touring national jazz performers. Regulars include Charmaine Neville, Ellis Marsalis, and Irvin Mayfield.The club was started by Glenn Menish in 1983 and later sold to George Brumat. Brumat owned the club until 2007, when he died of an apparent heart attack at the age of 63.

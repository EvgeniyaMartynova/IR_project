Norman's Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador

Norman's Bay is a settlement in Newfoundland and Labrador, situated at the head of Norman Bay, an extension of Martin Bay. The unofficial population is 52.
Norman Bay was a winter settlement for the fishing stations of Snug Harbour and Venison Tickle. At the time when southeast Labrador fishing stations were being encouraged to resettle in the 1960s, the Ward family at Snug Harbour resisted pressures to move to Charlottetown or another larger community and instead made Norman's Bay their permanent home. Most people are still dependent on fishing as the main source of income. 
The community is reliant on the postal, air, and medical services in nearby Charlottetown.

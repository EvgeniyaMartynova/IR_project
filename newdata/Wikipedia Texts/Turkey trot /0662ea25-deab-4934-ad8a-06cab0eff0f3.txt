Let's Turkey Trot

Let's Turkey Trot is a popular song written by Gerry Goffin and Jack Keller.  Some sources, including the original 45 LP have incorrectly credited the music to Carole King (King was Goffin's wife and usual songwriting partner but had no hand in this song). It was recorded by Little Eva and was released as her third single for the Dimension label. The Little Eva's recording debuted on the charts on February 2, 1963, and peaked at #20 on the Hot 100. It was her third top 40 record. The record features girl group The Cookies on background vocals, with the Cookies' lead Earl-Jean McCrea getting some solo lines. The song's title is a reference to the turkey trot dance step, a step that was only briefly popular fifty years before the song was released; the song is played at a tempo much slower than the one used for the dance in its heyday.
Little Eva's "Let's Turkey Trot" was used in the film Easy Rider, but it was omitted from the soundtrack album.
The song was covered by Jan & Dean on their 1963 album, Jan & Dean take Linda Surfin.
The Dollyrots covered the song on their EP "A Dollyrots Christmas".

Germanus of Granfelden

Saint Germanus of Granfelden (* ca. 612 in Trier; † 675 near Moutier (today in canton of Bern, Switzerland) was the first abbot of Moutier-Grandval Abbey.
Germanus hailed from a family of senators in Trier. He became a monk in Remiremont monastery near Metz, later in Luxeuil Abbey. When around 640 the monastery of Moutier-Grandval was founded, Abbot Waldebert of Luxeuil put him in charge of the monastery in which Germanus served for 35 years.
According to legend, Duke Eticho wanted to subdue in 675 the area around Delémont. Germanus and Randoald met him for negotiations near Courtételle (southwest of Delémont). After discussions Germanus and Randoald were slain on their way back by supporters of the Duke.
His day is 21 February. His crosier, one of the oldest remaining, is kept at Musée jurassien d'art et d'histoire in Delémont.

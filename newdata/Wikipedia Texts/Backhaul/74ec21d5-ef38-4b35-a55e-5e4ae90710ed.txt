Backhaul (trucking)

In trucking, a backhaul is a hauling cargo back from point B to the originating point A.  Since it costs almost as much time to drive empty as fully loaded. This makes economic sense, since it helps to pay for the operating expenses for the trip back to the originating point A for the trucking company and/or trucker.

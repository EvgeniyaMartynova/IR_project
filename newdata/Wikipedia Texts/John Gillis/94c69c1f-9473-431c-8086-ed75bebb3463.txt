== Education ==

== Personal ==
Gillis is married to Christina Mardsen Gillis, author of Writing on Stone: Scenes from a Maine Island Life.


== Academic work ==
Gillis' early work was largely in social and cultural history. He began as a German historian, moved to British history, and then to age relations, marriage, memory, and the cultures of European and American family life. He later moved on to global history, with an emphasis on cultural geography and environmental history.
In 2004 he published Islands of the Mind, on the role played by islands in the economic, political, and social dimensions of Atlantic world and the way the myths, images, and narratives of islands function for mainland cultures.
Gillis subsequently began studying the history and geography of coasts and coastal peoples. In his 2012 book The Human Shore: Seacoasts in History, he begins with the first humans to approach the shore, tracing coastal migrations around the world, and discussing the ways that coasts and coastal people have figured in globalization over several centuries. The book concludes with an assessment of the current crisis of coasts when faced with the effects of climate change, treating coasts as an ecotone that encompasses both land and water. The book was published by the University of Chicago Press.Gillis retired from Rutgers University in 2005 and since that time has lived in Berkeley, California while spending summers on Great Gott Island, off Acadia National Park in Maine. There he is involved with the Island Institute, in Rockland, Maine. He has published six books and edited four others.

== Works ==
His History of Ancient Greece, its Colonies and Conquests  was published in 1786; it was translated into French and German. This work was written with a strong monarchist bias.  See for instance the opening 'dedication to the king': 'The history of Greece exposes the dangerous turbulence of democracy, and arraigns the 	despotism of tyrants.  By describing the incurable evils inherent in every form of Republican policy, it evinces the inestimable benefits resulting to liberty itself from the 	lawful dominion of hereditary kings, and the steady operation of well-regulated monarchy'.
Other works included:

View of the Reign of Frederic II of Prussia, with a Parallel between that Prince and Philip II of Macedon (1789), rather a panegyric than a critical history;
translations of Aristotle's Rhetoric (1823) and Ethics and Politics (1786-1797);
translations of the Orations of Lysias and Isocrates (1778)
History of the World from Alexander to Augustus (1807).

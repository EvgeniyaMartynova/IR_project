Steph Evans of Earmilk wrote: "Cavazza takes a darker, more forward and downtempo turn" (on "So Much Better"), showcasing his falsetto and vocal talent over more stripped down production than what we've seen from him in the past, he brings the passion and force of a real star fighting for himself."

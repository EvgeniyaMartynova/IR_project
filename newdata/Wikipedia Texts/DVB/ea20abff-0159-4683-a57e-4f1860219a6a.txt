Divinylbenzene

Divinylbenzene (DVB) consists of a benzene ring bonded to two vinyl groups. It is related to styrene (vinylbenzene) by the addition of a second vinyl group.   It is a colorless liquid manufactured by the thermal dehydrogenation of isomeric diethylbenzenes.  Under synthesis conditions, o-divinylbenzene converts to naphthalene and thus is not a component of the usual mixtures of DVB.


== Production and use ==
It is produced by dehydrogenation of diethylbenzene:

C6H4(C2H5)2   â†’   C6H4(C2H3)2  +  2 H2Divinylbenzene is usually encountered as a 2:1 mixture of m- and p-divinylbenzene, containing also the corresponding isomers of ethylvinylbenzene.
Styrene and divinylbenzene react to form the copolymer styrene-divinylbenzene, S-DVB or Sty-DVB. The resulting cross-linked polymer is mainly used for the production of ion exchange resin.


== Nomenclature ==
Ortho: variously known as 1,2-diethenylbenzene, 1,2-divinylbenzene, o-vinylstyrene, o-divinylbenzene
Meta: known as 1,3-diethenylbenzene, 1,3-divinylbenzene, m-vinylstyrene, m-divinylbenzene
Para: known as 1,4-diethenylbenzene, 1,4-divinylbenzene, p-vinylstyrene, p-divinylbenzene.These compounds are systematically called diethenylbenzene, although this nomenclature is rarely encountered.

Democratic Voice of Burma

The Democratic Voice of Burma (Burmese: ဒီမိုကရေတစ်မြန်မာ့အသံ, abbreviated DVB) started as a non-profit media organization based in Oslo, Norway and Chiang Mai, Thailand. Run by Burmese expatriates, it made radio and television broadcasts aimed at providing uncensored news and information about Burma. Since 2012 DVB gradually moved back into Burma, where it is now an independent media company, called 'DVB Multimedia Group'.
In July 1992, DVB began broadcasting programming into Burma from studios in Oslo, Norway and transmitting via shortwave radio from the Norwegian transmitter at Kvitsoy. Now the broadcast is sent via satellite and free-to-air digital tv.
On May 28, 2005, DVB expanded its programming and began satellite television broadcasts into the country. The organization stated that it hoped to reach some ten million Burmese through this new effort (which it claims is the first free and independent Burmese language television channel), which was funded in part by non-governmental organizations such as Free Voice of the Netherlands, the National Endowment for Democracy, and the Freedom of Expression Foundation.In 2012, DVB started multimedia operations inside Myanmar openly, running a branch office with its former underground VJs.
In March 24, 2018, DVB started broadcasting on digital terrestrial television on MRTV DVB-T2 multiplex system.

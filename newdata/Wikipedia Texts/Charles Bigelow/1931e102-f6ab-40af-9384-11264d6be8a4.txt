== Career ==
Bigelow was the chief engineer of the Pemberton Mill, the collapse of which "is likely the worst industrial accident in Massachusetts history" and "one of the worst industrial calamities in American history".  According to one account:

Jesse Glover, overseer of repairs testified at the inquest that he had always considered the building weak. John B. Tuttle, superintendent of brick work testified that he had complained to the architect, Bigelow, that he thought the walls were insufficient. Mr. Bigelow in turn blamed the owners. Bigelow said that it was the owners who were responsible for all the purchasing and the approval of the iron castings.

Bigelow also worked as a consultant on the Augusta Canal.

While Chakor's mother Kasturi Bhuvan is pregnant with her, her father, Hariya, dies in an accident. Bhuvan has no money so he goes to Bhaiyaji's haveli to beg for money. Bhaiyaji's wife Tejaswini suggests that instead of paying the money back, they keep the unborn child as collateral. Kasturi and Bhuvan agree.

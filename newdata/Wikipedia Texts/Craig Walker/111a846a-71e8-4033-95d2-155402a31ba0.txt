Craig Walker (writer)

Craig Stewart Walker (born September 25, 1960) is a Canadian writer, theatre director, actor and educator.
Walker graduated from Bayview Secondary School and afterwards, began his career in the theatre as an actor with the Stratford Festival, the Shaw Festival and the National Arts Centre of Canada and other companies.  After returning to complete an M.A. in English and a Ph.D. in Drama at the University of Toronto, he was appointed to the Department of Drama at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, where he is currently Professor and Director of the Dan School of Drama and Music.From 1997 till 2007, Walker served as artistic director of Theatre Kingston, a company for which he has directed many productions including his own Finnegans Wake: a dream play (based on the novel by James Joyce), which played in both Kingston and Toronto in 2001, and Aeschylus's The Oresteia, which was performed with Proteus, a satyr play Walker wrote himself to replace the one that had originally followed the trilogy but had been lost since the 5th century BCE. In 2002, Walker wrote the book, music and lyrics for Chantecler: a musical (based loosely on a verse play by Edmond Rostand). More recently, he has worked as an actor and director with the St. Lawrence Shakespeare Festival in Prescott, Ontario.  That company's production of Twelfth Night, which was directed by Walker, won the 2012 Prix Rideau Award for Outstanding Production.  In 2009 he was appointed as a corresponding scholar with the Shaw Festival.

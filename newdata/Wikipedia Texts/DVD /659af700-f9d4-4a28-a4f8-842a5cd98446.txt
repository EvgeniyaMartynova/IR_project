Miscellaneous right

Miscellaneous right (divers droite, DVD) in France refers to right-wing candidates who are not members of any large party.  This can include members of small right-wing parties, dissidents expelled from their party for running against their party's candidate, or candidates who were never formal members of a party.  Numerous divers droite candidates are elected at a local level, but also at a national level.

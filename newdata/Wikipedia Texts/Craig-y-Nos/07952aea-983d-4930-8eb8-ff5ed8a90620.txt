The village experienced significant growth between the First and Second World Wars and in the 1960s.
Bishopston's rural location has influenced the pattern of its development. Most dwellings are detached or semi-detached and benefit from generous gardens. As a result, property in Bishopston is expensive by the standards of most of South Wales and is beyond the reach of many first time buyers.  Nearly all of the property in Bishopston is privately owned, with only 1% of homes rented from the local authority.Bishopston and the Gower was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.

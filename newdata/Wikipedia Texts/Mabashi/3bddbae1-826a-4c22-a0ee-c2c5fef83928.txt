Mabashi Station opened on August 6, 1898 as a station on the Nippon Railway Tsuchiura Line. It was nationalised on November 1, 1906, becoming part of the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) and the line name changed on October 12, 1909 to the Jōban Line. The privately owned Nagareyama Line began operations from Mabashi Station from March 14, 1916. Freight services from this station ceased on April 20, 1971, when the Jōban line was quadrupled. The station was absorbed into the JR East network upon the privatization of JNR on April 1, 1987.

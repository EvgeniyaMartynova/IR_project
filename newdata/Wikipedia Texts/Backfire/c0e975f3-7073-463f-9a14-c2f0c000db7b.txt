Backfire (Dexter's Laboratory)

Dexter's Laboratory is an American animated television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network. Initially debuting on February 26, 1995, as a seven-minute World Premiere Toons pilot, it was expanded into a full series after gaining network approval. The first season, which consists of 13 episodes divided into three segments each, premiered on TNT on April 27, 1996, and TBS and Cartoon Network on April 28. A second season of 39 episodes followed in 1997. In this season, Allison Moore, the voice actor for Dee Dee, was replaced by Kat Cressida, save for a few episodes. "Last But Not Beast", the second-season finale, was originally supposed to conclude the series in 1998. However, Tartakovsky directed a television movie titled Dexter's Laboratory: Ego Trip which aired on Cartoon Network on December 10, 1999. He left the series after the movie, focusing on his other projects, Samurai Jack and Star Wars: Clone Wars.
Production on a third season began in 2001 with Chris Savino taking over as creative director and later producer. It premiered worldwide on November 16, 2001, during Cartoon Network's "Dexter Goes Global" marathon. The third-season episode "Poppa Wheely/A Mom Cartoon/The Mock Side of the Moon" is the first to feature Christine Cavanaugh's replacement Candi Milo as the voice of Dexter. Milo would voice the character from the next episode onward, with the exception of "Tele Trauma". A fourth and final season consisting of 13 episodes aired from November 22, 2002, to November 20, 2003. In total there have been 78 episodes and a television movie across 4 seasons.
A previously unaired episode called "Rude Removal" was originally shown only at certain comic conventions that Tartakovsky attended beginning in 1998. The season two segment was released online by Adult Swim on January 22, 2013.

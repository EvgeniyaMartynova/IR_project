== Description ==
It's all change during the eighth season of CSI: Miami as the team faces the loss of one of their own and flash back to 1997. Delko departs, joining the State's Attorney as an investigator, forcing him to return to the lab undercover; Calleigh finds herself facing death once again, as the spirit of a victim helps her solve his own homicide; Horatio's ex-girlfriend is killed in an explosion, whilst the crime lab comes under siege from hostage takers. It's ultimately high-tech crime that cripples the team this season, however, as they are methodically taken down by a serial killer they're hunting, with one CSI paying the ultimate price.

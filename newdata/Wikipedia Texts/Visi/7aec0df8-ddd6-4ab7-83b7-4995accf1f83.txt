The school's name is often shortened to "Visi".

=== Blue-Ribbon Schools ===

== Extracurricular ==


=== Athletics ===
Visitation's mascot is Orloff the Mighty Viking and teams are normally nicknamed the "Visi Vikings". Visitation offers many sports for all grades. In-school activities include "Olympic Day" and a volleyball game. "Olympic Day" is a day-long event in which students from each grade compete in different activities. The volleyball game is another day-long event in which the 8th grade plays against the teachers (of any grade) in a volleyball game. Each homeroom (four homerooms) fields four teams and games take place throughout the day. Grades 1-7 watch the games (two grades for every four games) throughout the day as well.

GolfBrian Louis along with Tyler Day are the only golfers in Visitation history to record a hole-in-one.


=== Community Service ===
From first grade on many times of the year(for some grades almost everyday) there are opportunities for community service. Students raise money for charities, give gifts to those less fortunate, and many other things. The older the students get the more responsibility they have. Eighth graders have a group known as E.G.O.(Eighth Grade Organization) which controls a lot (but not all) of which community service activity the school does and when certain fundraisers are. E.G.O. however doesn't control certain activities because certain activities or fundraisers are annual (such as the Layette program or the Ronald McDonald House Collection) and are not changed. Also, E.G.O. does not head every project either. For example, the first grade heads a fundraiser to raise money for Guatemala schools. A.C.T.S.(Association of Catholic Teen Services) is a program that eighth graders can join (but do not have to) which travels around the community doing acts of community service by visiting nursing homes, tutoring under privileged kids, and many other things.


=== A Green School ===
Visitation always has worked to be energy efficient. Whether using fluorescent light bubbles or reusable materials in the cafeteria. Most recently, as part of a school project, a portion of the school's roof became a garden. Photos can be seen here.


== Families ==
"Families" is an in-school program, started in 2005, that pairs members of each grade (so eight members per family usually) together for one year and then the families are reorganized. The eighth grader in each family acts as the leader. "Families" participate in activities throughout the year such as making valentines for the elderly, creating things to hang up around the school, and simply have fun. Most recently "Families" created a human American Flag and sent to the U.S. troops overseas along with letters from each "family". "Families" are there to cut down on school bullying and troubles and allow for kids who normally feel left out at school find a home away from home.


== 60th Anniversary ==
Visitation celebrated its parish's 60th Anniversary in 2006. The parish started in 1946 (the school didn't start until three years later) as a small church. The church, originally, was a converted army barracks. When the parish began growing rapidly a new church was planned. That church is still in use today but has since been expanded.


== Extra ==
Visitation also has a large cafeteria which serves hot lunch every day.
Visitation has an auditorium which is complete with a large stage as big or bigger than some high-school stages.
Visitation's "VisiFest" is one of the largest parish festivals on the westside of Cincinnati.

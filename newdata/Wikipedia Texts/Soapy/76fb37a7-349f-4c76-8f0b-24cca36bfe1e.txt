He kicked 11 goals in a match on four occasions – twice in finals. In 1937 he left Carlton to play with Williamstown Football Club in the Victorian Football Association as captain-coach.

On 24 May 1941, Vallence achieved two significant milestones: he kicked a career-high twenty goals against Sandringham, and brought up his 1000th career goal across both the League and Association. His career with Williamstown ended after 1941, when the competition went into recess during World War II.

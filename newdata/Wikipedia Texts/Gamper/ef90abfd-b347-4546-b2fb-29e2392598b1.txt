Martino Gamper

Martino Gamper (born in Merano in 1971) is an Italian designer based in London who became internationally regarded through his project 100 Chairs in 100 Days. This group of works was exhibited in 2007 in London, the Milan Triennale in 2009 and at YBCA in San Francisco in late 2010. It has also been published by Dent-De-Leone as a book, 100 Chairs in 100 Days and its 100 Ways, recently republished as a pocket book. The 100 Chairs project has been described by Gamper as "3D Drawing", and is typical of Gamper's practice in that it shows disregard for the historic design standards of harmony and symmetry. Gamper has stated "There is no perfect chair".Gamper is married to the sculptor Francis Upritchard.

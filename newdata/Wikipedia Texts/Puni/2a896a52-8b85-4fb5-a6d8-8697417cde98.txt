== Border crossings ==
There is a road border crossing into Malaysia's Sarawak state at Kampung Ujung Jalan, 5km from Bangar town. Previously the crossing had to be done by vehicular ferry across the Pandaruan River which forms the Brunei-Malaysia border. However, a Malaysia-Brunei Friendship Bridge had been constructed and opened to vehicular traffic on 8 December 2013.
Both Brunei and Malaysia have constructed new customs, immigration and quarantine checkpoints at the location of the crossing. The Brunei checkpoint is called the Ujung Jalan Immigration Checkpoint. Before the construction of the bridge, the Brunei customs, immigration and quarantine checkpoint was housed in a wooden building in Kampung Puni, 500m from the ferry landing towards Bangar, while Malaysian customs and immigration procedures had to be carried out at Limbang wharf in Limbang, 15km away as there was no checkpoint at Pandaruan.

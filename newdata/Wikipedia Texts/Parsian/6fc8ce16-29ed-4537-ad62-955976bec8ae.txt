== New Geographic Changes ==
Iranian Parliament has enacted a new law to separate Gavbandi County from Hormozgan Province and add to Fars Province. Joining Fars province will bring prosperity to this region. Recently, there have been some protests going on against this new law in Hormozgan province, since the new law will cut the direct access of Hormozgan to gas rich fields and industrial regions in nearby Bushehr province.

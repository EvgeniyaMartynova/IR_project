First Turnbull Ministry

The First Turnbull Ministry (Liberalâ€“National Coalition) was the 70th ministry of the Government of Australia, led by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. It succeeded the Abbott Ministry after a leadership spill that took place on 14 September 2015 ended Prime Minister Tony Abbott's leadership of the Liberal Party of Australia. On 15 September, the National Party confirmed, after successful negotiations, that it would continue a coalition agreement with the Liberal Party, guaranteeing the Turnbull Government a majority in the Australian House of Representatives.The Turnbull Ministry carried over from its predecessor Abbott Ministry, until Turnbull announced significant ministerial changes on 20 September 2015 which took effect the following day. On 29 December 2015, Jamie Briggs resigned from his portfolio following a complaint regarding a late night incident with a public servant; and on the same day, Mal Brough stood aside pending Australian Federal Police investigations into the James Ashby affair.
A second rearrangement was announced on 13 February 2016 following the retirements of Andrew Robb on 10 February 2016 and Warren Truss on 11 February, and the resignations from the Ministry of Stuart Robert on 12 February and Mal Brough on 13 February. The second arrangement was sworn in by the Governor-General on 18 February.

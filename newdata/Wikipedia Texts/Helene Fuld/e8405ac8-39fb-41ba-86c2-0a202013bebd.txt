Helene Fuld Health Trust

The Helene Fuld Health Trust is the largest charitable trust in the United States devoted exclusively to supporting student nurses and nursing education.  The trust — which began as a foundation in 1935, but transferred its assets to the trust in 1969 — has provided grants, scholarships, and financial aid for the education, health, and welfare of student nurses.


== History ==

The story of the Helene Fuld Health Trust has three parts: (i) the Estate of Helene Fuld, who died in 1923, (ii) the Helene Fuld Health Foundation, which ran from 1935 to 1969, and (iii) the creation of the Helene Fuld Health Trust in 1969.


=== Estate ===
Helene Fuld, through probate proceedings following her death in 1923 (i.e., under the auspices of the Estate of Helene Fuld, Deceased), devised $91,718 to her two children.  Her husband (and father of her two children), Bernhard Fuld (1843–1918), had already died. Her children, Leonhard Felix Fuld (1883–1965) and Florentine Minnie Fuld (1878–1956), as devisees under her estate, shared the inheritance equally.


=== Foundation ===
In 1935, Leonhard Felix Fuld, LLM, PhD, and Florentine Minnie Fuld established the Helene Fuld Health Foundation, each contributing $5,000 in honor of their mother, Helene Fuld (née Helene Schwab; 1858–1923), who had been a health care advocate and education.The Helene Fuld Health Foundation assets grew – from $4.8 million in 1952 to more than $35 million in 1965. In 1961, Fuld — desirous that the foundation continue after his death or incapacity — structured a succession plan that would eventually transfer the assets to a charitable trust named the Helene Fuld Health Trust.
In 1950, the foundation's address was 8 Baldwin Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey.


=== Charitable trust ===
Leonhard Fuld died in 1965.  Four years later, in 1969, the Foundation was dissolved according to Fuld's instructions, and the foundation assets – around $25 million – were transferred into the Helene Fuld Health Trust that had been created in 1950.  The trust, in 1969, was managed by Marine Midland Bank, of Buffalo, as sole trustee. Marine Midland, was acquired by HSBC Bank USA in 1980 and changed its name to HSBC Bank USA in 1999.

Hirundinea ferruginea

The cliff flycatcher (Hirundinea ferruginea) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae. The cliff flycatcher is the only species in the genus Hirundinea after the swallow flycatcher was merged herein as subspecies Hirundinea ferruginea bellicosa.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, and heavily degraded former forest.


== Range ==
The cliff flycatcher is only found east of the Andes cordillera, and therefore is not found in Chile. All other South American countries are represented. In the Amazon Basin, it surrounds the basin in the foothills, and highest elevations at tributaries' headwaters; it ranges down to central Argentina west of the Pampas, and east of the Pampas to southern Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; also southeast of the Amazon Basin in the Brazilian Highlands, to the Atlantic and south Atlantic coast of Brazil, about an 8000 km stretch of coastline.

St Justinian

St Justinian (or St Justinian's or St Justinians) is a coastal location in Pembrokeshire, Wales, in the community of St Davids and the Cathedral Close. It is named for Justinian of Ramsey Island. There is a small harbour housing the St Davids Lifeboat Station, and a private residence. The harbour is used for boat trips to Ramsey Island, and for kayaking and speedboat trips.  It is a popular access point for the Pembrokeshire Coastal Path.The ruined chapel of St Justinian is nearby and is a Grade I listed building.  The 1870s old lifeboat house, 1911 lifeboat house, St Justinian's Well (19th century over an ancient spring), and an early 20th century watchtower are all Grade II listed buildings.
The bay on which St Justinian stands is known as Porthstinian.

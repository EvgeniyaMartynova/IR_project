=== Sexual harassment allegations ===
Following the English release of Dragon Ball Super: Broly, which prominently features Mignogna's vocal work, accusations of sexual harassment began to surface against Mignogna on Twitter, with some allegations dating as far back as 1989. Multiple accounts alleged that Mignogna kissed, groped and made unwanted comments to fans without their consent, some of whom were underage, using the hashtag "#KickVic". Voice actresses Monica Rial and Jamie Marchi also tweeted their support for those speaking out, and openly alleged being sexually harassed by Mignogna.On January 22, 2019, Tammi Denbrow, the executive director of employee relations at Sony Pictures, opened an investigation based on reports made by Rial, two female fans and a former Funimation employee, which concluded on January 29, 2019 and resulted in Mignogna's contract termination. On February 5, 2019, Rooster Teeth severed their business relationship with Mignogna, and Funimation recast Mignogna's role of the Executive in The Morose Mononokean. Funimation later publicly confirmed they had ended professional ties with Mignogna on February 11, 2019. In response to the controversy, Mignogna categorically denied any accusations of sexual harassment. However, multiple anime conventions withdrew Mignogna from their guest list.Mignogna issued an apology during his panel at Bak-Anime 2019 and again via Twitter on February 13, 2019. Since his termination, his fans, who have tagged their support under the hashtag "#IStandWithVic", raised over $236,000 on GoFundMe for legal funds. The GoFundMe account was opened by lawyer Nick Rekieta, who assisted Mignogna in acquiring Ty Beard as his attorney. On February 20, 2019, Mignogna confirmed on Twitter that he was pursuing legal action, and later filed a million-dollar lawsuit against Funimation, Rial, Marchi, and Ron Toye on April 19, 2019 for defamation and interference in existing contracts and prospective business relations. Funimation filed a response on June 12, 2019, denying Mignogna's allegations.On June 26, 2019, Mignogna was deposed. Funimation then filed an anti-SLAPP motion on July 1, 2019, seeking to dismiss Mignogna's lawsuit. Rial, Marchi, and Toye then filed their anti-SLAPP motions on July 19, 2019, with 10 affidavits, including ones from Kara Edwards and Michele Specht, as well as several allegations that he had made unwanted advances towards Mari Iijima. On July 30, 2019, another affidavit was submitted by the two fans from Funimation's investigation.Mignogna's team was required to file a response by August 30, 2019, but Ty Beard missed the deadline by 27 minutes, citing technical issues, and later submitted a notice to withdraw and resubmit the affidavits on September 2 due to "defects in form". One of the affidavits included a testimony from Chuck Huber. The defense's legal team called for sanctions under suspicion as to whether the affidavits were legally notarized. As a result, Mignogna received a court order to appear at the hearing set for September 6, 2019 intended for considering the defendants' anti-SLAPP motions, but he did not attend. During the hearing, 7 of the 12 cases, particularly against Marchi, were dismissed and Mignogna was required to pay all of her legal fees, with another ruling scheduled in 30 days. On September 17, 2019, Judge John Chupp ordered both legal teams to mediate by October 3, 2019 and would rule on all outstanding orders if the mediation is unsuccessful. On October 4, 2019, Judge Chupp announced that the remaining cases had been dismissed. Mignogna filed an appeal on October 24, 2019, with a hearing set for November 21, 2019.

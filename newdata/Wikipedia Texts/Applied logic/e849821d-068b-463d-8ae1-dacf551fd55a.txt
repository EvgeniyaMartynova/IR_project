Applied Logic Corporation

Applied Logic Corporation (AL/COM) was a time-sharing company in the 1960s and 70s.
Headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, AL/COM started in 1962 working on "mathematical techniques and their applications to problem-solving."Seeing the need for in-house time sharing the company bought a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-6 and developed its time sharing service, which came on-line in 1966.  In 1968 the company registered AL/COM as a trademark for its service.  The system involved both custom software and custom hardware.
By 1969 Applied Logic had four DEC PDP-10 dual KL-10 systems with plans for a fifth, and had expanded nationwide with offices in San Jose, San Diego, and San Francisco.  The company also planned to market its time sharing systems in addition to providing services.  The company reported sales of $1,200,995, with an operational loss of $63,456.By 1972 AL/COM had local dial-up facilities in ten cities: Boston, Massachusetts, Buffalo, New York, Chicago, Illinois, Indianapolis, Indiana, Montclair, New Jersey, New York, New York, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Princeton, New Jersey, Washington, DC, and Wilmington, Delaware.  The computer center was located in Mathematics Park in Princeton.By 1970 the company was in financial difficulty and negotiated an agreement to defer $1,300,000 of debt.  Applied Logic filed for Chapter XI bankruptcy in 1975.

Budzhak Horde

Budzhak Horde or Belgorod Horde was one of the successors of the Lesser Nogai Horde between the 17th century and the 18th century that were settled in the Northern Black Sea coast under protectorate of the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire, Sanjak of Ozu (Yedisan). Its capital was in Căușeni.
In the 1620s the horde migrated from the Pontic steppes to the steppes of the Budzhak. The Bilhorod Tatars (20,000-30,000) were nomadic herdsmen. They made forays for slaves and loot into Right-bank Ukraine and Moldavia. In 1770 the horde became a protectorate of the Russian Empire and soon after was dispersed through resettlement in the Azov steppes. From there its remnants emigrated to Turkey during the Crimean War.
Among the most prominent leaders of the horde was Khan Temir who established the noble Moldavian family of Cantemiresti.

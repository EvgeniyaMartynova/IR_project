== History ==
During the early 1970s, Gwinnett County led the US in growth. This phenomenal growth rate produced overcrowding in its school systems, leaving South Gwinnett High School and Berkmar High School too overcrowded to accommodate excess student populations. In 1975, construction began on a new school. The students chose a panther as their school mascot, with orange and white as their school's colors, and blue as an accent color. The school was named "Parkview" after Stone Mountain Park. The doors opened in 1976 with Bartow Jenkins as its first principal.
The school expanded, both in area and number of students, until it was filled above capacity in the early to mid-1990s. In 2005, Parkview took over the then adjacent Trickum Middle School to create more space for its rapidly expanding population. The old Trickum Middle School building was reinstated as the "9th Grade Academy," and many freshman courses were relocated there. In moving classes to the new building, the school eliminated all of the nearly 70 trailers that had been used as annex partition on the school's property for the past decade.
Parkview has an average SAT score of 1557, making it one of the top 25 schools in the state. Its graduation rate is 88.5 percent.

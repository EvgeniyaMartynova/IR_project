== History ==
Parkview graduated its first class in 1957. The following year, a new wing was constructed due to the large number students enrolling. In 1992, an auditorium was added to Parkview for its music and drama productions. In 2001, a new music room was finished and renovations to other classrooms were completed. The most recent changes to Parkview have been the demolition of the old north wing and adding a new wing to replace it. It was completed and occupied in January 2006. It was formally dedicated on September 21, 2006. Phase two of the addition was completed at the beginning of the 2008-09 school year. The second addition included a new library media center, cafeteria and kitchen, and many classrooms; the old library and cafeteria were converted to classrooms as well. Over 90% of the building is new or renovated construction since the completion of the two-phase, 20 million dollar project in November 2008. A formal dedication ceremony for Phase II was held on September 18, 2008.
The school's mascot is the Viking. Its news show is called Vike Vision. Parkview has an ID policy that requires students to wear an ID badge.

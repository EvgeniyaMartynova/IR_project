Moycullen GAA

Moycullen GAA (Irish: CLG Máigh Cuilinn) is a group title for several Gaelic Athletic Association clubs based in Moycullen, County Galway. The three clubs, Cumann Peil Máigh Cuilinn (Moycullen Football Club), Cumann Iománaíocht Máigh Cuilinn (Moycullen Hurling Club)and Cumann Camógaíocht Máigh Cuilinn (Moycullen Camogie Club) share playing facilities and cooperate on a number of local community and sporting issues. The clubs are members of the Galway GAA. There are two other clubs in the parish with indirect GAA affiliations, Moycullen Ladies Football Club and Moycullen Handball Club, who also share the club facilities.
The club facilities are situated in the townland of Baile Dóite and include two full-size pitches, a 25 square metre all-weather pitch, a 20-metre double sided hurling wall, a 200 capacity covered stand, player changing facilities and some small meeting rooms. The site also includes a stand-alone indoor handball complex. There is also considerable capacity for car parking. The history of the GAA in Moycullen goes back to the beginning of the 20th century. It was well organised within the parish by 1914.


== Cumann Peil Máigh Cuilinn ==
The football club (Cumann Peil Máigh Cuilinn) is in the West Board section of the Galway League and Championships, and takes part in all under-age, junior and senior competitions in the county.
Moycullen achieved Senior status in football in 1964 by winning the County Junior Championship and, except for a short stay at Intermediate level in 2008, Moycullen has been senior ever since. However, they have yet to win a County Senior League or Championship, despite reaching 3 County Finals.
In 2008, the club enjoyed great success at Intermediate level. Having won the County Intermediate title in 2007, Moycullen progressed to the Connacht Intermediate Club Football Championship final, where they defeated Ballintubber of Mayo by 3-11 to 1-08. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they defeated Annascaul after a close encounter, reaching their first ever All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship Final. The final on February 18 at Croke Park was played against Fingal Ravens. A tense game was eventually decided in the last ten minutes, when Conor Bohan struck two goals, ensuring Moycullen were crowned All-Ireland Intermediate Champions, at a score of 2-09 to 1-06. It was the completion of a well-deserved treble.
Over the years, many players have been honoured in all grades by the county. Paul Clancy, an All-Ireland winner in 1998 and 2001, played with the club and worked as a selector with former senior football manager Alan Mulholland. Gareth Bradshaw is a member of the current Galway football panel. Current player Mark Lydon is a 'dual player', having been part of county squads in both football and hurling.

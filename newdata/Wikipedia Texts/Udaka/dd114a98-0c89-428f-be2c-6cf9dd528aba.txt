Uddaka Ramaputta

Uddaka Rāmaputta (Sanskrit: Udraka Rāmaputra) was a meditator and a teacher of meditation. Uddaka Rāmaputta, as his name implied, was a son of Rāma. Uddaka, who was one of the teachers of Gautama Buddha is considered to be a Jain and taught refined states of meditation known as the immaterial attainments. After departure Gautama Buddha first went to Ālāra Kālāma and after following his method equalled his master. At this time Ālāra had nothing else to teach Gautama. But Gautama was eager to learn more, so he started to search for another teacher. He found Uddaka Rāmaputta and accepted him as teacher.

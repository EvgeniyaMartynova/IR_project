Wedgie

A wedgie is the act of forcibly pulling a person's underwear upwards from the back. The act is often performed as a school prank or a form of bullying.
Wedgies are commonly featured in popular works, either as a form of low comedy or as a behaviour representative of bullying. In such works, briefs are usually the type of underpants that are worn by the victim.


== Dangers ==
Wedgies, especially when performed on males, can be dangerous, potentially causing testicular or scrotal damage. An incident in 2004 involving a ten-year-old boy required reattachment of a testicle to the scrotum.


== Variations ==

As a prank or form of bullying, there are a number of variants to the normal, or traditional wedgie. It is impractical to list every variant, as the names and processes can be rather subjective; however, there are a few better-known variants of the wedgie.

The melvin is a variant where the victim's underwear is pulled up from the front, to cause injury, or, at least, severe pain to the victim's genitals. The female variant is sometimes called a minerva.
The atomic wedgie entails hoisting the waistband of the receiver's underwear up and over their heads. This form is the title character's signature prank from The Mask: The Animated Series.
The hanging wedgie is a variant in which the victim is hung from his or her underwear, elevated above the ground.

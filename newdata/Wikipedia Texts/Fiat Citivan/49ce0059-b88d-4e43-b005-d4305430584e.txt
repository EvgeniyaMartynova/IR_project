Fiat 900T

The Fiat 900T is a small van produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Fiat between 1976 and 1985, replacing the similar Fiat 850T. It was sold in the United Kingdom as the Fiat Citivan.
It was available in a number of variants, including the 900E seven seat minibus, and 900E camper vans called Amigo and Pandora.

The 900T was powered by a rear mounted, four cylinder 903cc petrol engine, shared with the Fiat 127. In the 900T, it produced 35 bhp (26 kW; 35 PS) at 4,500 rpm and 44.84 lb⋅ft (61 N⋅m) at 3,300 rpm. The 900T was equipped with small 12" wheels, and had a small turning circle of 29 ft 6.5 in (9.00 m). The van was fitted with drum brakes all around.
Fiat did not produce pickups at the time, so third party coach builders, such as the well known Zagato, Viotti, specialists of Satae Ghiae, like Fissore, Moretti, Orlandi, Vignale, Coriascoe Pasino, would purchase 900T vans from the factory of Fiat, and convert them into campers and pickups similar to the versions by Volkswagen. 
These companies cut away the rear body, and added panels as needed to complete the conversion, and then re sprayed the original colour. 
Coriasco and Fissore stamped the rear of the body with their own VIN to the right of the original Fiat VIN, which were then combined into one longer VIN on the title. The pickup version was very similar to the Volkswagen Combi with raised rear bed, removable bed walls and large storage area accessible from either side underneath.

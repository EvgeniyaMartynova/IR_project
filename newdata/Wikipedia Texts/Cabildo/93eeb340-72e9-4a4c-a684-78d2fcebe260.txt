Cabildo abierto

Cabildo Abierto (Spanish for "Open cabildo" or "Town hall meeting") is a Uruguayan political party.
With strong emphasis on public security, family values and social conservatism, and opposing gender theory, they claim Artiguism as their main source of inspiration. Their presidential candidate is the former Commander of the Uruguayan National Army, Guido Manini Ríos, nowadays a harsh critic of President Tabaré Vázquez.Some international news outlets such as El País from Madrid analyse this phenomenon as a sign of upcoming political polarization in a traditionally centrist country. There are several military officers, both active and retired, and also former members of the defunct far-right movement Juventud Uruguaya de Pie.

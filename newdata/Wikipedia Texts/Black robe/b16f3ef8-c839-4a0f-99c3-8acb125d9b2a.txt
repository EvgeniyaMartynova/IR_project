Frankie Thomas, Sr. portrayed the judge, and John Green was the court clerk.A review in the trade publication Billboard praised the assortment of non-actor characters but commented that "the program goes overboard" in its efforts to achieve realistic images and dialog. The reviewer also found that the episode presented too many cases, which limited their development and resulted in a bare-bones presentation of each case.

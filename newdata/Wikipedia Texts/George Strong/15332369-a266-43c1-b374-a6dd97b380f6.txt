George Templeton Strong was born in New York City to Ellen (Ruggles) and George Templeton Strong, an attorney. The family was musical; both parents were amateur musicians and his father was on the board of the New York Philharmonic Society. His father was active in the community and helped found the United States Sanitary Commission during the American Civil War. Since the 1930s, the senior Strong has been notable for the literary quality of his voluminous diary, which he kept most of his life. With early musical promise, the son was given lessons and training. While the senior Strong hoped his son would follow him in the law, they became reconciled before the father's death.  Strong went to Europe for study at the Leipzig Conservatory.

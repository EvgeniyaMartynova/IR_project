National Games of China

The National Games of the People's Republic of China, sometimes known as the All China Games (though not to be confused with the All-China Games), is the premier sports event in China at national level. It is usually held once every four years, most recently in August 2017, when the 13th National Games of China took place in Tianjin. 
The forerunner of the Games was the Chinese National Games, first held in 1910 during the Qing Dynasty. This ran until 1948 and the competition was relaunched under its current name in 1959, following the formation of the People's Republic of China. It's unknown if the Chinese National Games continued by the Republic of China which is now currently based in Taiwan.

SpaceX Dragon C106

The SpaceX Dragon C106 is a Cargo Dragon space capsule built by SpaceX. It is the first reused SpaceX Dragon capsule to be reflown into space, having its second launch in 2017. This marked the second occasion that SpaceX launched previously spacelaunched hardware, after reusing Falcon 9 first stage B1021 earlier in 2017. Capsule 106 was first used on mission NASA SpaceX CRS-4, and then used again for the NASA SpaceX CRS-11 mission. This reuse of the spacecraft marks a milestone in SpaceX's drive to reduce spacelaunch costs through reusing hardware.

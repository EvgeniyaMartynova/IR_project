Spanish frigate El Gamo

The Spanish ship El Gamo was a 32-gun xebec-frigate of the Spanish Navy involved in action with, and subsequently captured by Lord Cochrane on 6 May 1801. The Action of 6 May 1801 is notable for the large disparity between the size and firepower of El Gamo and her opponent, the British brig Speedy; the former was around four times the size, had much greater firepower and a crew six times the size of Speedy, which had a reduced crew of 54 at the time of the engagement.After her capture, El Gamo was sold to the ruler of Algiers as a merchantman.

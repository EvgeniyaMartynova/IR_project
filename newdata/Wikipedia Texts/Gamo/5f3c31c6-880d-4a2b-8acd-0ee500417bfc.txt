=== Gamō Katahide ===
Gamō Katahide (蒲生 賢秀, 1534 – May 26, 1584) was a Japanese daimyō of the Sengoku period through Azuchi-Momoyama Period. Katahide, the eldest son of Gamō Sadahide, was a retainer of the Oda clan.


=== Gamō Ujisato ===
Gamō Ujisato (蒲生 氏郷, 1556 – March 17, 1595) was the heir and son of Gamō Katahide, lord of Hino Castle in Ōmi Province. He later held Matsusaka (Ise Province) and finally Aizuwakamatsu Castle (Aizu Domain) in Mutsu Province. He was the son-in-law of Oda Nobunaga.


=== Gamō Hideyuki ===
Gamō Hideyuki (蒲生 秀行, 1583 – June 13, 1612) was a Japanese daimyō who ruled the Aizu domain. He was the son of Gamō Ujisato. A Catholic, Hideyuki was moved to Utsunomiya (180,000 koku) in Shimotsuke Province after his father died in 1595. In 1600, he was given Aizu, worth 600,000 koku.


== Gamō Bitchū ==
Gamō Bitchū (蒲生 備中, unknown - October 21, 1600), also known as Gamō Yorisato (蒲生 頼郷), was a samurai of the Gamō clan during the Azuchi-Momoyama Period. Very few details about Gamo Bitchū exist, and historians remain unsure as to whether Gamo was named Yorisato or Satoie. Gamō Bitchū fought at the Battle of Sekigahara with 1,000 Gamō samurai on the Western side, under the losing forces of Ishida Mitsunari. He died on the battlefield along with the bulk of his men.

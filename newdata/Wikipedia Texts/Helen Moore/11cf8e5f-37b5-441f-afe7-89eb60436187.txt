Moore Hall (Kansas State University)

Moore Hall is a co-ed residence hall at Kansas State University, Kansas, United States. It is located on the East side of Kansas State's Manhattan, Kansas campus in the North-West corner of the Derby Complex, north of West Hall and west of Haymaker Hall.  It is known for its Leadership Studies and Business cluster floors.   After the end of the Spring semester, students typically move out of the halls, but Moore provides residency for year-round students along with Haymaker Hall.  Some return to live there another year while others move on to live off-campus or in fraternities and sororities.

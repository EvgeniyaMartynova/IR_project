Our Happy Hardcore

Our Happy Hardcore is the second studio album by German dance group Scooter. The European release date for the album was 28 March 1996.
Three singles were released from the album, starting with "Back in the U.K." in November 1995 and "Let Me Be Your Valentine" in February 1996. The final single, a cover version of the Billy Idol song "Rebel Yell", followed in May 1996. The mostly instrumental "Crank It Up" is notable for its use as the theme tune for the Bruno segments in Da Ali G Show.
Followed by the success of the debut album "...And The Beat Goes On", this album continues the experimenting of happy hardcore and ravestyles.

The song "Last Minute" is a version of the Hebrew folk song "Hava Nagila".
"Experience" is based on Scooter's unreleased remix of "Angeli Domini" by Datura.
"Back In The UK" samples the theme tune of the British television series Miss Marple, originally composed by Ron Goodwin.
"Hysteria" is a cover of "Hysteria (There's No Reason To Be Disturbed)" by Hysteria. This track was made by Rick J. Jordan in 1991, so this track is technically a cover of their own track.
A remixed version of "Crank it Up" is used in the Da Ali G Show as Br端no's (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) theme music. This version is later used in the 2009 movie "Br端no". Although labeled as "Br端no's Vienna Calling Mix", the original track was featured Scooter's 2009 compilation album "The Alb端m".

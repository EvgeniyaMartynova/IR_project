Entertainment said that "Tisdale wants to dance, and not in that G-rated, Disney-fied way, either, in this video. We see her practicing some sexy moves, seductive looks and various hand-to-hair gestures after watching. Fortunately, all that preparation eventually pays off, and she finally makes it onto the dance floor". As of March 2019, the music video has surpassed 20 million views on YouTube.

Ferris Bueller (TV series)

Ferris Bueller is an American sitcom television series based on the 1986 John Hughes film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The show stars Charlie Schlatter in the title role. The series debuted on August 23, 1990, on NBC and was cancelled on August 11, 1991, within its first season, a few months after its debut. The show was produced by Maysh, Ltd. Productions in association with Paramount Television.  Hughes was not involved in the show's production.


== Synopsis ==
Though based on the film, the series was not a canon continuation, rather it was set up to portray itself as being the "real life" situations upon which the film was loosely based. In the pilot episode, Ferris (Schlatter) refers to the film and expresses his displeasure at Matthew Broderick portraying him, even going as far as destroying a life-size cardboard cutout of Broderick with a chainsaw. However no further references to the film within the series' continuity would be made after this. As in the film, the series focused on Ferris Bueller and his high school experiences at Ocean Park High, including dealing with his best friend Cameron (Brandon Douglas), love interest Sloan (Ami Dolenz), and sister Jeannie (Jennifer Aniston).
Although the film was set in Chicago, the series was set in Santa Monica. Like the film, Ferris is liked by everyone as the "cool guy on campus." He is extremely popular, suave, quick witted and a master of ceremonies who often breaks the fourth wall. Cameron is still a depressive neurotic who, through Ferris, is able to loosen up occasionally. Sloan is portrayed slightly different in that she is not completely wrapped around Ferris' finger and has to be won over at times. Ed Rooney is the primary antagonist and always out to get Ferris but usually ends up foiled or humiliated. His secretary, Grace, is not a wise-cracking sarcastic, but a passive pushover with an unreciprocated crush on Ed. Jeannie is constantly at odds with Ferris and his being favored by all. Though she can be antagonistic, she has proven not all bad, albeit begrudgingly. In the film, Mr. and Mrs. Bueller's names are Katie and Tom but in the series they are Barbara and Bob, as well as Ferris being a junior and Jeannie being a senior as opposed to the other way around in the movie.

== Reception and cancellation ==
Compared to the film, the show received mostly negative reviews from critics. It also suffered from comparisons to not only the '80s film, but also another series, Parker Lewis Can't Lose; at the time that series initially proved to be more successful when it came to ratings, lasting for three seasons. Ratings for Ferris were strong at first, but declined in later episodes. The series was cancelled due to poor viewership and low ratings after one season airing a total of thirteen episodes.

== Critical reception ==
Billboard wrote that Heather Small and the band “deftly blends state-of-the-charts club trends with a reverence for classic Motown and R&B sounds. After one spin, you'll be humming the chorus for a week, which is the mark of a true smash."Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report commented on the song: "Excitement about this uptempo winner is spreading fast and one listen should explain why."Music & Media wrote: "The '90s will be type-cast as the age of retro, both in rock and in dance. These people restore Funky Town as the capital of good old disco. A floor filler annex airplay hit is born!"

"Moving on Up" proved to be M People's biggest hit worldwide, but just reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart.

== Other versions ==
Moving on Up was also a dance hit for Belgian singer Roselle in 1995.
The chorus is interpolated in the song "Gloves" by Australian comedy group Thanks Pet, Next, a hidden track on their EP Frogstamp, which satirises invasive body searching. In that concext, the phrase "moving on up" becomes a double entendre.

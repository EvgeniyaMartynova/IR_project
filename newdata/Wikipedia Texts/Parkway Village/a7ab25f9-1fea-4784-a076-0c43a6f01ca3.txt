Parkway Villages

Parkway Villages is a 577-lot, 224-acre (91 ha) subdivision in western Houston, Texas. It is located north of Lakes of Parkway, the former Barnhardt land tract. It was the first single family housing development by Sueba USA, a subsidiary of SÃ¼ba Freie Baugesellschaft.


== History ==
The project's development began in 1993. It was developed in a joint venture between Sueba USA and Hypo Bank of Munich. It was built in an area that was originally supposed to have a 563-acre (228 ha) office park. That office park, which had been developed for about $70 million, was not built due to the 1980s oil bust. Michael Baldwin of Sueba stated that originally, the buyers of houses in Parkway Village were retirees. The original plan called for 464 lots. From February to October 1993, the first 43 houses in the development were sold.Ralph Bivins of the Houston Chronicle wrote that this subdivision "was key to Sueba's winning the Developer of the Year award from the Greater Houston Builders Association." By 2002 the building of houses was almost complete. In 2002 Bivins stated that Lakes of Parkway was "one of the largest communities to be developed inside city limits in recent years." Development of houses in the subdivision ended in 2003.

Viveash, Western Australia

Viveash is a suburb in Perth, Western Australia, in the City of Swan. It was named after Dr Samuel Waterman Viveash, the owner of the land in this area in the 1840s. Samuel Viveash came to the Swan River (Western Australia) on the Britomart, which sailed from Spithead on 3 July 1838, and arrived at Fremantle on 5 December 1838 where he took up land in the Swan River Colony in the Avon Land District. A copy of Viveash's diaries for the period 1838 to 1851 can be accessed at the University of Western Australia Library. The suburban area of Viveash was developed by the Midland Brick Company (now Boral) which carried out subdivision in 1967 and requested in 1968 that the area be named after Viveash.

Black Moor (musical group)

Black Moor is a Canadian heavy metal band formed in 2005 in Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada. Since their inception, they have worked steadily to expand their fanbase and refine their sound. After a period of several years of self-promotion the group signed to Halifax-based Diminished Fifth Records in mid-2009 and through them released their debut album The Conquering.In June 2008, the members of Black Moor were involved in a car accident while on their way home from playing a show in Montreal. Although all the band members survived, the crash left drummer Sylvain Coderre with numerous injuries including a leg broken in three places, broken toes, broken jaw, lacerated skull and spleen. While the rest of the band walked away with minor injuries, the accident set back production on the bands' debut album The Conquering by almost a full year.In August 2009, Black Moor released their debut album The Conquering to critical acclaim.

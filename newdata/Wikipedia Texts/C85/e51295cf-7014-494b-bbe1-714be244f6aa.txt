ο Velorum
HD 74560 (HY Velorum)
HD 74146 (NZ Velorum)
HD 74071 (HW Velorum)
HD 74196
HD 74535 (KT Velorum)
HD 75466
HD 73952IC 2391 appears to be about the same age as the open cluster IC 2602, and has a lithium depletion boundary
age of about 50 million years. IC 2391 has been closely linked to the Argus Association of co-moving stars. Proposed members of this moving group include Denebola, Epsilon Pavonis, 49 Ceti, HD 61005, and HD 88955.

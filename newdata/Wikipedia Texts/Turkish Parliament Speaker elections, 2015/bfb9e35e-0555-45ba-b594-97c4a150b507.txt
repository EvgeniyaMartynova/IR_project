=== Motion to delay ===
Ä°dris Baluken, a parliamentary group leader of the People's Democratic Party (HDP), raised a motion to delay the speaker election on the grounds that two HDP MPs were on hunger strike in the district of Nusaybin, Mardin Province, which had entered its tenth day of military curfew. Baluken claimed that this would result in the election outcome not being representative of the parliamentary composition. Interim speaker Deniz Baykal however rejected the motion regarding it as irrelevant to the parliamentary agenda.

== Review ==
Aparadhi got a poor review from the reviewer of Filmindia with the review titled "Poor story with poorer direction" and calling it "Bankrupt direction". The story was cited as being "very thin" with weak screenplay. The music lacked appeal and a song item in Zulu style was especially panned as not required in an "essentially Indian setting". Madhubala was praised and stated to be the "only silver lining".


== Soundtrack ==
The music director was Suresh Phadke, with lyrics by Amar Varma. The playback singers were Sitara Kanpur and G. M. Durrani.

Soundtrack to Your Escape

Soundtrack to Your Escape is the seventh studio album of Swedish metal band In Flames. It was released on March 29, 2004 by Nuclear Blast.  The album was available in both a regular jewel case release featuring 12 tracks, and a limited edition digipak with a bonus track, "Discover Me Like Emptiness." The Japanese version had the additional track "Clayman."
There was also a special edition which included a bonus DVD with videos of the first two singles, "The Quiet Place" and "Touch of Red", and live footage. Videos were also made for "My Sweet Shadow", "Like You Better Dead", "Borders and Shading" and  "F(r)iend." The album was criticized by longtime fans because of the band playing different music on the album. However, the album was seen by many as a natural progression from Reroute to Remain and was critically praised in many areas of the press such as Metal Hammer and Kerrang!.  Soundtrack to Your Escape reached number 3 in Sweden.  In the USA it peaked at number 145 on the Billboard 200 (their first album to reach the Billboard 200), number 2 on the Top Heatseekers chart, and number 7 on the Independent Albums charts.

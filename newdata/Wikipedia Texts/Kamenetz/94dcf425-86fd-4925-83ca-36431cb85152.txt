=== Baltimore County Executive ===
On November 2, 2010, Kamenetz was elected as the 12th Baltimore County Executive, succeeding James T. Smith, Jr.Baltimore County launched its landmark "Schools for Our Future" program, a $1.3 billion ten-year school construction and renovation initiative designed to meet the needs of Baltimore County’s educational facilities by eliminating existing and projected overcrowding, modernizing learning environments, and improving safety. Through the program, Baltimore County is building 16 new schools and performing 19 major additions and renovations, reducing the number of Baltimore County Public Schools without central air conditioning from 90 in 2010 to 13 in 2017.In December 2012, Kamenetz had proposed building a new fire station in Towson Manor Park, a pocket park that represented the only green space in the Towson Manor Village neighborhood. The then-existing fire station in Towson was old and located in a site that could possibly be redeveloped for commercial purposes. The property was ultimately sold, and the proceeds used to pay for the new fire station. But the county was able to find space on underused land it already held in downtown Towson, leaving Towson Manor Park untouched. Three Baltimore County Schools and a police station, all on the county's east side, were also affected by similar land sales to developers.In 2016, Kamenetz was elected President of the Maryland Association of Counties, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that serves Maryland’s counties by articulating the needs of local government to the Maryland General Assembly.

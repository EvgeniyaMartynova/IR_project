Robert Hite (artist)

Robert Hite (born 1956 in Richmond, Virginia) is an American visual artist. Hite lives and works in Esopus, New York. Robert Hite is inspired both by a rich Southern narrative tradition and closeness to nature. The imagery in his work draws upon the memories of his childhood in rural Virginia during the Civil Rights Movement era. Hite is interested in exploring issues of local knowledge, memory, transience, environment, disenfranchisement and domicile as living art. Much of his photographic work juxtaposes the artificial and the natural and play with architectural scale. In April 2014, Hite was named as a Guggenheim Fellow for his work in fine arts.


== Education ==
Hite attended Virginia Commonwealth University (in Richmond, Virginia), and the Corcoran School of Art. Hite worked as a studio assistant to Leon Berkowitz.


== Work ==
Hite's work, blending painting, sculpture, and photography, concentrates on narrative forms.  His work is grounded in the rural landscape and iconography of his childhood in Virginia. His paintings have been compared to Eugène Delacroix and Albert Pinkham Ryder. Since 2006, his work has been increasing in its use of mixed-media culminating in the show Imagined Histories. In this series, Hite takes photographs of model houses that he situates in natural settings.

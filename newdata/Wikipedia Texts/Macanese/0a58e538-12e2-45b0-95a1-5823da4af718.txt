Macanese cuisine

Macanese cuisine is unique to Macau, and consists of a blend of southern Chinese (especially Cantonese) and Portuguese cuisines, with significant influences from Southeast Asia and the Lusophone world. Many unique dishes resulted from the spice blends that the wives of Portuguese sailors used in an attempt to replicate European dishes. Besides local Chinese ingredients, its ingredients and seasonings also include those from Europe, Latin America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia.
Common cooking techniques include baking, grilling and roasting. The former, seldom seen in other styles of Chinese cooking, exemplifies the eclectic nature of Macanese cooking.  Macau is renowned for its flavour-blending culture, and modern Macanese cuisine may be considered a type of fusion cuisine.
Typically, Macanese food is seasoned with various spices including turmeric, coconut milk, and cinnamon, and dried cod (bacalhau) , giving special aromas and tastes. Famous dishes include galinha à Portuguesa, galinha à Africana (African chicken), bacalhau (traditional Portuguese salt cod), pato de cabidela, Macanese chili shrimps, minchi, and stir-fried curry crab.  Other dishes include pig's ear and papaya salad, and rabbit stewed in wine, cinnamon and star anise. Tapas are also an integral part of Macanese cuisine.
The most popular snack is the pork chop bun. The most popular desserts are ginger milk, pastéis de nata (egg tarts), and almond cake.
Famous restaurants of Macau include the Restaurante Riqueixo, Porto Interior, Restaurante Litoral, Restaurante Espao and Restaurante O Santos.

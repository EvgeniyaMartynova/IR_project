Vivian L. Smith Elementary

The Berea City School District is located in Berea, Ohio that serves Berea, Brook Park, and Middleburg Heights, as well as a portion of Olmsted Falls.
The district consists of one high school, one middle school, and four elementary schools.


== Berea–Midpark High School ==
Berea-Midpark High School, which houses grades 9-12, was founded in 2013 as a result of the merger between Berea High School, founded in 1882, and Midpark High School, founded in 1959. The oldest part of the current structure, which originally housed Berea High School, was built in 1928, with several later additions.


== Berea–Midpark Middle School ==
Berea–Midpark Middle School was established in 2013 as part of the district's consolidation plan and houses students in grades five through eight. It is located in the building that was originally built in 1959 as Midpark High School. From 2013 to 2018, it was known as Middleburg Heights Junior High School for grades seven through nine.

The former Midpark High School was renamed the Middleburg Heights Junior High and housed the district’s seventh to ninth graders until 2018. Ford Intermediate School, formerly Ford Middle School, included fifth and sixth graders until 2018. Roehm Middle School in Berea closed at the end of the 2012–2013 school year and was demolished. The property was converted to the district's athletic complex.

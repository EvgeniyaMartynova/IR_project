== Gameplay ==
Field of Honor is a man-to-man simulation of the joust for medieval knights.


== Reception ==
John Rankin reviewed Field of Honor in The Space Gamer No. 55. Rankin commented that "My recommendation: If you like to design games, do so.  You might get paid for it.  Don't pay a 'professional' game designer for the privilege of finishing his work.  It's a bad investment of your time and it encourages sloppy work."

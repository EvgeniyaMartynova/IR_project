St. James College (Brisbane)

St. James College in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, teaches over 400 students from grades 7 to 12 under the direction of the headmaster Anne Rebgetz. St. James College, informally known as "Jimmies", was established in 1868 with only 12 students and is the oldest Roman Catholic boys' school in Queensland. In 1893, the Christian Brothers agreed to take over the school following major economic depression, the government's refusal to pay staff wages and inconsistent student enrolment.
Jerome William Long (1834–1891) was the first lay Principal to lead St James between 1871–1877, and again in 1880-90, he is accredited with being the first teacher to hold a Class   2, Division 1 certificate in Queensland. Long was honoured by the college, which named Long House after him.In 1994, the college began to accept enrolment from girls in years 8 and 11, making it a co-educational institution. In 1994, its name was changed to St. James Prac.; it was then reverted to St. James College in 2001. In 2002, its first female principal was appointed. The college has also been known as Edmund Rice College, St James's, and St James Practical College. The college constructed a new library and science complex, named the Joseph Canali Centre completed in 2015 when the college began accepting enrolments for grade 7. In 2013 enrolment stood at approximately 480 students. In 2016 St James brought a dog named "Jimmie" into their library, he is a pug.

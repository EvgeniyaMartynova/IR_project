Parshall Township, North Dakota (page does not exist)

Among the categories of names for sports teams, those referring to Indigenous peoples are lesser in popularity only to the names of various animals (Eagles, Tigers, Bulldogs, Panthers, Wildcats, Lions, Cougars). In the top ten, "Warriors" is number six, and "Indians" is number eight. The typical logo is an image of a stereotypical Native American man in profile, wearing a Plains Indians headdress; some are more realistic, while others are cartoons or caricatures. Other imagery include dreamcatchers, feathers, spears, and arrows. Individual schools may have performance traditions, such as the  tomahawk chop, a mascot or cheerleaders in stereotypical Native attire, and chants adapted from Hollywood movies. These fictional representations stand in the way of any authentic understanding of contemporary Indigenous peoples, and promote racism.The documents most often cited to justifying the trend for change are an advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Both support the views of Native American organizations and individuals that such mascots maintain harmful stereotypes that are discriminatory and cause harm by distorting the past and preventing understanding of Native American/First Nations peoples in the present.
The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two-thirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI). In a few states with significant Native American populations, change has been mandated by law, such in Wisconsin, Oregon, and Washington. A bill to ban Native American mascots statewide passed the Maine House of Representatives and Senate and was signed into law by Governor Janet Mills in May, 2019.The list below for secondary schools in the United States and Canada remains substantial, with over 400 teams currently calling themselves "Indians", over 100 "Braves", over 100 "Warriors" using indigenous imagery (there are many with the name using generic, Greek or Roman mascots), and 48 "Redskins". The latter has shown the greatest decline, due to an association with the Washington Redskins name controversy.

Goldring (audio company)

Goldring is an audio equipment manufacturing company that was established in 1906.  In 1906, the Scharf brothers started manufacturing phonographs in Berlin, Germany. The company moved to England in 1933 and  continued manufacturing cartridges and turntables. The "Juwel Electro Soundbox" phonograph was their own creation and was released in 1926. The Goldring logo was as indication of quality.
In 1954 they released the Goldring 500 magnetic cartridge. This was British made.
Goldring cartridges have been sold in the US since the 1950s and sold all over the world. They range from the budget to high-end. They also sold Swiss-made Lenco turntables in the 1970s. For example, the Lenco L75 was marketed via Goldring as a GL75.
The Scharf brothers changed their name to Sharp and continued their family business until 1987. At this time, Gerry Sharp sold the company to the Goldring distributor, Veda-UK (which is now part of Armour Home).
Even though Goldring were mainly known for their moving coil cartridges and moving magnet cartridges, turntables etc., they also manufactured later sound cones and headphones.

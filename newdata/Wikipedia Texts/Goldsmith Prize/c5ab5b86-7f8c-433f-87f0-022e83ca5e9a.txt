Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting

The Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting is an award for journalists administered by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. The program was launched in 1991, with the goal of exposing examples of poor government, and encouraging good government in the United States. There is a $25,000 award for the winner.
The Goldsmith Awards Program is financially supported by an annual grant from the Greenfield Foundation.

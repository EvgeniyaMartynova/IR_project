New Hellenic Television

New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (Greek: Νέα Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνία, Ίντερνετ και Τηλεόραση) or NERIT (ΝΕΡΙΤ) was the state-owned public broadcaster for Greece from 4 May 2014 to 11 June 2015. Antonis Samaras's coalition government established NERIT to replace the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) in 2013: NERIT began broadcasting under their identity on 4 May 2014, replacing the transitional service Dimosia Tileorasi.

== History ==


=== Background ===

On 11 June 2013, the Greek government announced its intention to close ERT, due to unfair recruitments over the past 30 years of previous governments's favors to persons without degrees and without passing the exams of ASEP with exchange of voting them eternally and with immediate effect and to open a new organization entitled NERIT (Νέα Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνία, Ίντερνετ, Τηλεόραση - Nea Elliniki Radiofonia, Internet, Tileorasi - New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television) and built it from top to bottom, with employees with degrees and certifications of passing the exams of ASEP. That night, the government started to shut down every transmitter of ERT in Greece. Many employees refused to leave ERT's headquarters at the House of Radio in Agia Paraskevi and continued to broadcast an internet TV channel on Greek, Cypriot and other European media sites. A few days later, ERT's signal was restored on some analogue frequencies in Greece, broadcasting a strike programme from Agia Paraskevi. In the meantime, the president of PASOK, Evangelos Venizelos, blackmailed the prime minister that if he don't stop the closing of E.R.T., will, immediately, leave the coalition government, along with the president of the Democratic Left, Fotis Kouvelis and push the country into new elections, which means another expenditures against the people and lack of stability in the country.
On 10 July 2013, after 28 days of black screens on ERT's digital channels, a transitional service started broadcasting on ERT frequencies as ΕΔΤ (Ελληνική Δημόσια Τηλεόραση - Elliniki Dimosia Tileorasi - Hellenic Public Television) from Paiania studios. A few hours later the broadcasting authority renamed the channel ΔΤ (Δημόσια Τηλεόραση - Dimosia Tileorasi - Public Television). ΔΤ, the transitional channel, transmitted old Greek movies and scientific, social and historical documentaries from ERT's archives. Βουλή Τηλεόραση (Vouli Tileorasi - Parliament Television) broadcasts sessions and documentaries from the Greek Parliament.
On Wednesday 21 August 2013, ΔΤ started live broadcasting with: "Πρωινή ενημέρωση" (Proini Enimerosi - The Morning News) from its Katehaki headquarters on several public TV frequencies. Sporting events such as the FIA Formula 1 World Championship and the UEFA Champions League were broadcast by ΔΤ (Δημόσια Τηλεόραση - Dimosia Tileorasi - Public Television) with commentaries from journalists. The broadcaster launched a redesigned logo for "ΔΤ".
On the morning of 26 September 2013, the Ελληνική Δημόσια Ραδιοφωνία (Elliniki Dimosia Radiofonia - Hellenic Public Radio Broadcasting) started live broadcasting with a programme called Πρώτο Πρόγραμμα (Proto Programma - First Programme) on several public frequencies. www.hprt.gr was launched as the official website of Hellenic Public Radio Television.
On 1 December 2013 ΔΤ stopped using the DIGEA platform. ΔΤ now broadcasts via the ex-ERT transmitters on three different frequencies: On the first (23 UHF from Athens), ΔΤ broadcasts 3 TV channels (ΔΤ1, ΔΤ HD, Vouli TV) and 3 Radio channels (ΔΡ1, ΔΡ2, ΔΡ3). ΔΤ1 is the main ΔΤ TV channel. The logo ΔΤ remained unchanged. ΔΤ HD (Dimosia Tileorasi High Definition) broadcast mainly the same as ΔΤ1 but in HD. The logo of ΔΤ HD is the same as ΔΤ with a small "HD" logo on the right-hand side of the screen. Technical details of ΔΤ HD: 1080i and Dolby Surround Digital Plus. ΔΡ1 and ΔΡ2 broadcast the same radio coverage, whilst ΔΡ3 later became a different channel. On the second frequency (37 UHF), ΔΤ broadcast 4 digital TV channels (ΕΔΤ, TV5 Europe, Nova Cinema 1 and Nova Sports-Disney XD). ΕΔΤ broadcast the same programme as ΔΤ1. On the third frequency (56 UHF from Thessaloniki), ΔΤ transmitted 4 TV channels (ΔΤ2, RIK, BBC and DW). ΔΤ2 broadcast exactly the same programme as ΔΤ1.
On Monday, 10 March 2014, at 7 a.m., the Ελληνική Δημόσια Ραδιοφωνία (Elliniki Dimosia Radiofonia - Hellenic Public Radio Broadcasting) began live broadcasting of a second radio channel called Τρίτο Πρόγραμμα (Trito Programma - Third Programme) along with Πρώτο Πρόγραμμα (Proto Programma - First Programme).
On Good Friday, 18 April 2014, ΔΤ2 broadcast a different TV programme to cover only the Basketball Euroleague play-off game between Panathinaikos B.C. and CSKA Moscow. The temporary logo of ΔΤ2 was the same as ΔΤ with a small "2" on the right-hand side.

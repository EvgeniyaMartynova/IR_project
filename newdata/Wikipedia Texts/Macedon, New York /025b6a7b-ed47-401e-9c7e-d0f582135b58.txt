== Etymology ==
Macedon took its name from the ancient Greek Kingdom of Macedon. The toponym Macedon is derived itself from the ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός (makednós), meaning "tall", possibly descriptive of the inhabitants of Macedon. It has the same root as the adjective μακρός (makros), meaning "long" or "tall" in Ancient Greek. The name is originally believed to have meant either "highlanders", "the tall ones", or "high grown men".


== History ==
Prior to early settlement, the area in and around Macedon was home to the Seneca Nation, a tribe member in the Iroquois League.The town land was acquired for settlement in 1788 from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The first settlers, Webb and Hannah Harwood, arrived in 1789.The construction and completion of the Erie Canal from 1817-1825 brought many new settlers to the area. The town of Macedon was incorporated during the canal construction in 1823, from what had been the western half of the Town of Palmyra. The opening of the Erie Canal led to the forming of new port communities like Wayneport and the Village of Macedon, with the latter centered on Lock 30.
Remnants of the former Enlarged Erie Canal Lock 60 (also called the Lower Macedon Lock) are located along the canal trail off Quaker Road, just east of the Village of Macedon. It was built in 1841 as a single-chamber lock, but doubled in 1874. The lock had a lift of 10.02 feet (3.05 m) to the west. It was abandoned in 1914. The site is currently maintained as a park. Nearby are the remains of Erie Canal Change Bridge #39 (also called Gallup's Bridge), located just west of the intersection of O'Neil and Quaker roads. A change bridge allowed towpaths to switch from one side of the canal to the other. The bridge was constructed in 1881 and had an iron lattice truss with a wooden floor. Only the foundations are still in place.The Macedon Academy, open from 1841 to 1902, set a standard for education excellence of the era. The Academy provided an intermediate level of education, between the district school level and college.
Part of Company B, 160th New York Volunteer Infantry, was raised in Macedon during the American Civil War.  At the time, the town had a population of only a little over 2,500.The J. and E. Baker Cobblestone Farmstead and Charles Bullis House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.The town is part of the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor.

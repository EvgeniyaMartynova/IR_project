== History ==
Wellington station opened in 1900 as a local station on the original Northwestern Elevated Railroad route from Lake and Wells in downtown to Wilson Station. From the late 1940s Wellington became a station on the Ravenswood route (now the Brown Line). The original station house was demolished in the 1960s following a fire. Purple Line express trains began stopping at the station in 1998 as part of an effort to help alleviate congestion on the Brown Line.

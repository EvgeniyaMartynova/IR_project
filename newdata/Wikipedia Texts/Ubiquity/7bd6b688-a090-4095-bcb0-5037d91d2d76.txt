Ubiquiti Networks

Ubiquiti Networks is an American technology company started in 2005. Based in New York, NY, Ubiquiti manufactures wireless data communication products for enterprise and wireless broadband providers with a primary focus on under-served and emerging markets.


== Products ==
Ubiquiti sells wired and wireless networking products under multiple brand names. The company also sells grid-tied solar kits.
Ubiquiti's first product line was its "Super Range" mini-PCI radio card series, which was followed by other wireless products. 
The company's Xtreme Range (XR) cards operated on non-standard IEEE 802.11 bands, which reduced the impact of congestion in the 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz bands. In August 2007 a group of Italian amateur radio operators set a distance world record for point-to-point links in the 5.8 GHz spectrum. Using two XR5 cards and a pair of 35 dBi dish antennas, the Italian team was able to establish a 304 km (about 188 mi) link at data rates between 4 and 5 Mbit/s.The company (under its "Ubiquiti Labs" brand) also manufactures a home-oriented wireless mesh network router and access point combination as a consumer-level product, called AmpliFi.


== Security issues ==


=== U-Boot configuration extraction ===
In 2013, it was discovered that there was a security issue in the version of the U-Boot boot loader shipped on Ubiquiti's devices. It was possible to extract the plaintext configuration from the device without leaving a trace using Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) and an Ethernet cable, revealing information such as passwords.While this issue is fixed in current versions of Ubiquiti hardware, despite many requests and acknowledging that they are using this GPL-protected application, Ubiquiti refused to provide the source code for the GNU General Public License (GPL)-licensed U-Boot. This made it impractical for Ubiquiti's customers to fix the issue. The GPL-licensed code was released eventually.


=== Uparte Trojan ===
It was reported by online reporter Brian Krebs, on June 15, 2015, that "Recently, researchers at the Fujitsu Security Operations Center in Warrington, UK began tracking [the] Upatre [trojan software] being served from hundreds of compromised home routers — particularly routers powered by MikroTik and Ubiquiti’s AirOS". Bryan Campbell of the Fujitsu Security Operations Center in Warrington, UK reported, "We have seen literally hundreds of wireless access points, and routers connected in relation to this botnet, usually AirOS", said Bryan Campbell, lead threat intelligence analyst at Fujitsu. "The consistency in which the botnet is communicating with compromised routers in relation to both distribution and communication leads us to believe known vulnerabilities are being exploited in the firmware which allows this to occur".


== IPO ==
On October 13, 2011, Ubiquiti Networks had its initial public offering (IPO) at 7.04 million shares, at $15 per share., raising $30.5 million.


== Legal difficulties ==


=== United States sanctions against Iran ===
In March 2014, Ubiquiti agreed to pay $504,225 to the Office of Foreign Assets Control after it allegedly violated U.S. sanctions against Iran.


=== Open-source licensing compliance ===
In 2015, Ubiquiti was accused of violating the terms of the GPL license for open-source code used in their products. The original source of the complaint updated their website on May 24, 2017, when the issue was resolved.


=== Other ===
In 2015, Ubiquiti revealed that it lost $46.7 million when its finance department was tricked into sending money to someone posing as an employee.

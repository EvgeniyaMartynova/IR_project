== History ==
In October 1956 , Vilnius Trolleybus Board was established and a 7.8 km long contact network was built, together with a trolleybus park for 25 trolleybuses. In November 1956, first model "MTB-82D" trolleybuses started to work and drove on route "Antakalnis–Railway station".
In 1981, the trolleybus count doubled the maximum service power of the old trolleybus park, thus, encouraging a construction of the second park. The second trolleybus park was opened on 28 December 1985, in the neighborhood of Viršuliškės and it could maintain 150 trolleybuses.
In April 1993, the board was reorganized to UAB "Vilniaus Autobusai" and the owner of the new company was the Vilnius city municipality. From the treasury of the municipality, new "Škoda" trolleybuses were bought in 1996–1999.
From 2004 to 2006, 45 new Polish trolleybuses "Solaris Trollino 15AC" were bought.
On 4 November 2011, the company was again reorganized and incorporated into UAB "Vilniaus Viešasis Transportas".In 2012, new Lithuanian "MAZ-ETON Amber 203T Vilnis 12AC" trolleybuses were made and bought by the company.
In 2018 and 2019, 41 "Solaris Trollino 12" trolleybuses were bought.

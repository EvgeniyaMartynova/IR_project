Udayagiri, Kannur

Udayagiri is a  village in Thaliparamba taluk of Kannur District in Kerala, India. It is about 55 km from Kannur city.


== Economy ==
The people of this village mainly depend on agriculture for their income.  The villagers of this hamlet migrated from the southern parts of Kerala in the early 1940s, most of them from Kottayam and Ernakulam district.  These days the economy is driven by remittances from people employed elsewhere.


== History ==
An aboriginal population of hunter-gatherers, known locally as "Maayilyans" lived here for generations before the so-called settlers from the southern part of Kerala arrived. They survived on hunting and gathering honey in the vast forests. The Maayilyan community was pushed out of the forests, their way of life, and displaced by the migrants. The "Maayilyans" became either daily wage workers in the area or survived on making and selling artifacts out of bamboo.
During the early days (1950s), the settlers lived in tree houses to escape from the large number of elephants present in the area. The needs of the population were very basic. They cleared forests and planted rice, yucca and bananas. The essential services like local hospitals or schools did not exist. Transportation was very limited. Educational institutions were tens of miles away. The daily staples beyond what they produced, had to come from Thaliparamba, which was about 35 km away by foot. Many early families in the area had to fight years-long, painful legal battles to get their land rights.

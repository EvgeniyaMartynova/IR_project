Left for Dead (Wussy album)

Left for Dead is the second album by Wussy, released in 2007. It was recorded by all the band's members playing together, rather than in separate tracks, resulting in what NPR described as "a meaty collection of songs with the feel of a garage band always on the verge of spinning out of control." It was chosen as the 14th greatest album of the decade by prominent critic Robert Christgau.

The cover art shows a goddess rising above a river and the field of snakes. Another piece of art in the booklet shows these snakes emerging from a giant tentacle/Cornucopia. It also features many sigils. The album's logo is Vesica piscis, or Venn diagram of two sets, presumably the real world and the hidden world. It was illustrated by Jason Gardner of Buckland, Massachusetts.

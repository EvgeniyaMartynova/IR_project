Becoming associated with Washington Duke of Durham, North Carolina in 1878, he helped organize and  incorporate W. Duke Sons and Company, a tobacco business of which he became a stockholder, secretary, and treasurer. However, being the only non-family member in the company created some animosity between Watts and the oldest Duke son, Brodie. This resentment resulted in Brodie purchasing multiple streets in Durham, North Carolina, and naming them so they read "Washington, Hated, Watts," referring to his father, Washington Duke. Years later, "Hated St." was changed to "Gregson St." In 1890, Watts helped organize the American Tobacco Co. and in 1892, the Erwin Cotton Mills Company.

=== Duke University ===
By 1922, Watts Hospital's quality of care and philanthropic mission to provide healthcare to the working poor was so well-regarded that James B. Duke and North Carolina Governor Cameron Morrison proposed the creation of the state's first four-year medical college, Duke University. The goal was to educate students in conjunction with clinical services provided at Watts Hospital.


=== Watts School of Nursing ===
In addition to founding the clinical hospital, George Watts also established the Watts Hospital Training School for Nurses at the hospital, in 1895. It was then renamed the Watts School of Nursing (Watts SON), and had its first graduate, Ethel Clay, in 1897. Watts SON has been housed at Durham Regional Hospital since 1976, and is now a part of the Duke University Health System.

A post office called Cardington was established in 1827. Cardington was named for the first industrial tool the town had, the carding machine. The city itself was founded in 1836.
A series of tornadoes on June 11 and 13 of 1981, each killing four people, destroyed a very large portion of the village. Due to the small size of the town, and the extent of the damage to the business district, a very detrimental impact on the community was felt.

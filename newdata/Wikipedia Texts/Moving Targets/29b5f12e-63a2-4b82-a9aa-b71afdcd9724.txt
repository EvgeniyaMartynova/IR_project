== Reception ==
AllMusic wrote: "Penetration's debut album stands among the very last true greats of the first wave of British punk offerings." Trouser Press wrote: "Penetration's debut LP mixes expansive creations and direct punk-outs, all done with flair and originality. Unlike other LPs by young bands of this era, Moving Targets still sounds surprisingly fresh."

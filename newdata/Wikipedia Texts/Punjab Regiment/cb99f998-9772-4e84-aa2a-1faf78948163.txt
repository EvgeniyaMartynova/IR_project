Punjab Regiment (Pakistan)

The Punjab Regiment is an infantry regiment of the Pakistan Army. The modern regiment was formed in 1956 from an amalgamation of the 1st Punjab Regiment, 14th Punjab Regiment, 15th Punjab Regiment and 16th Punjab Regiment. Since then the regiment has expanded in strength to now include 54 battalions.
It is the senior-most regiment in the Army, tracing its lineage back over two hundred and fifty years to 1751.   The regiment's battalions have a distinguished record of military service spanning the rise and decline of British power in South Asia, both World Wars and post independence Pakistan.


== Early history ==
The Punjab Regiment can trace its origins to the Madras Army of the British East India Company.  The most senior battalion of the 1st Punjab Regiment was raised in 1759 as the 3rd Battalion of Coast Sepoys, and is the senior most surviving infantry battalion of the British Indian Army.  Their first major conflict was a decisive victory at Battle of Wandiwash in 1760, when the British East India Company led by Sir Eyre Coote effectively ended French colonial ambitions in South Asia.  All the battalions of the regiment subsequently played an important role in the early military campaigns of the East India Company and were actively engaged in the wars against the French, Mysore and the Marathas.The numbers and titles of the battalions changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army, the British Indian Army and the Indian Army during the 18th, 19th and 20th Centuries. The names changed from Coast Sepoys to Carnatic Infantry, Madras Native Infantry, Punjabis and finally to the Punjab Regiment. After 1857, the British applied the Martial Races theory and north Indian troops replaced the South Indians, the regiment eventually being renamed as The Punjab Regiment. It now has 76 battalions.


== British Raj ==
Following 1857 and the establishment of crown rule over British India, the Punjab regiment played a role in numerous conflicts across the British Empire.  Various battalions were deployed across the Empire in conflicts in places ranging from China, Egypt, Burma and Abyssinia.
Between 1903 and 1922, the British Indian Army included 28 numbered Punjabi Regiments.  In 1922 these were amalgamated into six numbered Punjab Regiments, namely;

1st Punjab Regiment
2nd Punjab Regiment
8th Punjab Regiment
14th Punjab Regiment
15th Punjab Regiment
16th Punjab RegimentThese regiments would all play a prominent role during World War II.  Within the 14th Punjab Regiment, the 1st and 5th battalions were deployed in Malaya during the opening stages of the World War II in South East Asia. The 1st Battalion, under Lt Col James Fitzpatrick, was overrun by superior Japanese forces at Changlun during the Battle of Jitra. With only 270 survivors, the 1st Battalion was not reformed during the campaign. The 5th Battalion, under the command of Lt Col Cyril Stokes, performed relatively well in the fighting retreat to Kroh in early December 1941. Stokes was killed during the Battle of Muar in January 1942. The 5/14th Punjabs was forced to surrender along with the rest of the commonwealth troops when Singapore fell on 15 February 1942. A number of troops from both battalions however later joined the Indian National Army, and formed a part of the Hindustan Field Force of the first INA.


== Independence ==

In 1947 the British Government announced the independence of British India, which would be split into two separate countries, India and Pakistan. The Indian Army would also be divided between these two new nation states. Out of the six existing Punjab regiments, the 1st Punjab, 8th Punjab Regiment, 14th Punjab, 15th Punjab Regiment and 16th Punjab were allotted to the Pakistan Army and 2nd Punjab Regiment to the Indian Army.
The Punjab Regiment in its present form was formed in 1956 when four of the five Punjab Regiments allocated to Pakistan were merged.

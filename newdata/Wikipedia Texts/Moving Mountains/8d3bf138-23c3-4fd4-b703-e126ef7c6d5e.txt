== Background and composition ==
"Moving Mountains" was written by The-Dream, Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, Kuk Harrell and Usher, and produced by The-Dream and Stewart. Recorded at Triangle Sound Studios and Chalice Recording Studios, it was leaked in February 2008, before being officially released for sale on May 23, 2008.
"Moving Mountains" is a slow jam ballad, and contains synth beats and electronic influences. Portions of the song follow a chord progression used in OneRepublic's "Apologize". Partway through the song the beat is adjusted, while the musical instruments are accentuated. Usher's voice ranges from tenor to falsetto. The song's lyrics are of a "struggle to get through to his girl", and contain an extended metaphor, relating his fight for love to that of moving mountains, wishing for the situation to change. Fraser McAlpine from BBC called it "a cold, sad song with cold, sad lyrics".


== Critical reception ==
Leah Greenblatt called it "an easy pick" as a single, while Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine lauded it as "further evidence that Usher always delivers musically". "Moving Mountains" was dubbed by The Guardian's Rosie Swash "a marked improvement on the sex-pestery" of "Love in This Club", and the AbsolutePunk reviewer called it "one of Usherâ€™s most impressive efforts to date", likening the song to Usher's 2004 single "Burn". However, while Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy was impressed with the technicalities of Usher's vocals, he found it "hard to take Usher completely seriously when he insists on wailing each line", advising Usher to "stick to party bangers in the future".

== Music video ==
The music video to "Moving Mountains" was released on May 21, 2008. Directed by the Brothers Strause, it is a continuation of the video for "Love in This Club". The video was shot in front of a green screen.The video begins with Usher exiting the club in which the "Love in This Club" video takes place, then shows a fiery transition into the next scene, showing the burnt-down club. As the song begins, Usher inspects the smoking ruins and imagines a woman in a shard of a broken mirror. He travels through a desert, and takes off his jacket to reveal a tight-fitting t-shirt, and again imagines the woman, this time in a desert pond. Upon reaching a mountain on which his love interest appears, Usher climb the mountain and rain starts to fall. When he reaches the top of the mountain, the rain clears to be replaced by snowfall. Usher finds that the woman is, yet again, merely an illusion. He opens a locket to reveal a portrait of himself and his partner, which freezes over and cracks. As the video ends, Usher kneels, and the mountains breaks around him, leaving a sole pillar for him to stand on.
Idolator noted similarities in some scenery between the music video and Madonna's "Frozen" video. It was placed at number eight on BET's Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2008 list.

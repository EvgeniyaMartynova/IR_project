Neorhodomela larix

Neorhodomela larix, commonly known as black pine, is a species of red algae native to coastal areas of the North Pacific, from Mexico to the Bering Sea to Japan. It forms dense mats on semi-exposed rocks in intertidal areas. The thallus is dark brown to black in color with whorled branches resembling a bottlebrush.

The brown alga Soranthera ulvoidea is commonly found as an epiphyte on Neorhodomela species, especially N. larix  Isabella Abbott notes that individuals of Soranthera growing on Neorhodomela species as a host differ from those found on other hosts by tending to be attached more broadly, thick walled, spherical, and occurring primarily in northern or central California.

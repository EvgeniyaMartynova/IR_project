Old St. Anastasia Catholic School

Built in 1914, the Old St. Anastasia Catholic School is a historic school in Fort Pierce, Florida. It is located at 910 Orange Avenue. It was built by James P. McNichol, a senator from Philadelphia who fished in Fort Pierce during the winter, for the pastor that rode into town once a month. Along with the masonry school, McNichol had built a wooden church, rectory, and convent. Eventually the Catholic Mission would end in 1911 and the school was all that remained. On August 10, 2000, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. After damage from Hurricane Frances and Jeanne, the structure was in a state of disrepair. The building has since been stabilized and awaits restoration.

Contour leg pillow

A contour leg pillow is a pillow that is placed between the legs, usually at knee level, during sleep. These pillows have been shown in studies to relieve lower back pain.The contoured pillow serves two purposes: to provide alignment for the pelvis, and to prevent friction between the legs while sleeping.

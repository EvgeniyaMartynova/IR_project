Dakimakura

A dakimakura (抱き枕; from daki 抱き "to embrace or cling" and makura 枕 "pillow") is a type of large pillow from Japan. The word is often translated in English as a body pillow. In Japan, dakimakura are similar to Western orthopedic body pillows, and are commonly used by Japanese youth as "security objects".


== History ==
During the 1990s, dakimakura began to intertwine with otaku culture, leading to the production of pillow covers featuring printed images of bishōjo and bishōnen in lying poses from various anime or bishōjo games. Many of these early otaku dakimakura covers were released through Cospa, a character goods and apparel store which continues to release official dakimakura covers to this day.
Although sometimes called a "Dutch wife", the original definition of this phrase is closer to the chikufujin, or "bamboo wife".
The year 2015 saw some of the first talking body pillows with Ita-Supo and its mascot, Rina Makuraba. It was invented by former Kyushu Institute of Technology researcher, Koichi Uchimura.


== Sizes ==
A dakimakura is available in two main sizes, 160 or 150 cm (63 or 59 in) in length with a 50 cm (20 in) width (100 cm (39 in) circumference).
Prior to the mid-2000s, dakimakura were available in one size; 160 cm × 50 cm (63 in × 20 in), which is considered to be the authentic Japanese-sized pillow. Since the late 2000s, 150 cm × 50 cm (59 in × 20 in) dakimakura became available and increasingly popular due to shipping cost savings from being under the 2 kg (4.4 lb) airmail weight limit.Love pillows are a subset of dakimakura usually portraying life-size pictures of anime characters. Some pillows may portray furry characters, anime characters or pornographic film actors in suggestive poses.

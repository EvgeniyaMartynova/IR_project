== Background ==
In July 2012, during an interview with MTV, Jay Sean revealed about the collaboration with Afrojack. He said "Afrojack was working in the same studio that I was in when I was recording the album, and I happened to bump into him. We recognized each other, so we checked out. He played me a couple of his songs; I played him a couple of my songs. We were like, 'Yo, let's do something together.'"He added that "The song 'So High' is just ridiculous. Afrojack is such an amazing producer." He also commented on Afrojack, saying that "Again, he lives in the clubs. He knows what works. So when it comes to actually producing, he knows what's gonna have an impact in the club."Sean further added "So, the production on this is just incredible," "It sounds insane 'cause, again, the songwriting here was the same team who were behind 'Down,' 'Do You Remember' — myself and Jared Cotter. When we write songs, it just works. So that plus Afrojack's unbelievable production skills ... it sounds phenomenal."

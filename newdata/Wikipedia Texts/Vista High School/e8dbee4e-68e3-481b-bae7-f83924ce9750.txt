VAHS was designed to support students who are at-risk of dropping out of high school and those who have had difficulties at other schools. VAHS is normally only open to Juniors and Seniors, but in the past few years a small number of Sophomores have been admitted. Daily attendance at the school numbers around 200, allowing for a small school environment and smaller teacher-to-student ratios.

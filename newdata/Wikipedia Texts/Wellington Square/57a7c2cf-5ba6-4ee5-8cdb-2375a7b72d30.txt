Wellington Square, North Adelaide

Wellington Square is a public square in the Adelaide suburb of North Adelaide, South Australia, in the City of Adelaide. It is roughly at the centre of the largest of the three grids which comprise North Adelaide.
The square was named on 23 May 1837 after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, Irish born field marshal and statesman, and victor at Waterloo, who is credited with securing the passage of the South Australia Foundation Act through the British House of Lords. Colonel William Light, first Surveyor-General of South Australia and a member of the Street Naming Committee, had briefly served under Wellington as a junior staff officer. Light's 1837 plan of Adelaide included Wellington Square.

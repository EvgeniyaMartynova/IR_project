== History ==

Wellington Square was subdivided in 1912 by George L. Crenshaw.  Wellington Square was developed by prominent real estate developer M.J. Nolan.  Nolan was a native of Syracuse, New York and settled in LA in 1886.  In 1914, Nolan started to develop 90 acres of land between Adams and the new La Fayette Square.  He died in 1918, and the W.I. Hollingsworth Co. continued lot sales.  The boom years of the 1920s saw the peak of  development of the neighborhood. Homes in the neighborhood are an architectural mixture from Craftsman and Revival styles of the 1920s and 1930s.
In 1955, construction of the Santa Monica Freeway was started.  The first segment opened in 1961 and the freeway was completed in 1964.  It was named by the State Highway Commission on August 14, 1957.  Many homes in Wellington Square were demolished by Caltrans to build the freeway.

Feeling Good Is Good Enough

Feeling Good Is Good Enough is the third studio album by American stoner metal band ASG. It was their third studio album released by Volcom Entertainment. Singles from the album include "John Wayne", "Horse Whipper", and the title track.  The quote "Feeling good is good enough" is a direct homage to the feature film Platoon when the words were said by Willem Dafoe to Charlie Sheen after they smoked marijuana out of a shotgun.

== Career ==
Founding members of the group were Zulema Cusseaux, Brenda Hilliard and Al Bailey. Originally a trio called the Lovelles, when they met record producer, Van McCoy, and were signed to a recording contract by Maxwell Records, the group's name was changed to Faith, Hope and Charity. Their song "So Much Love" hit #14 on the Billboard R&B chart and #51 on the Hot 100 in 1970.  The subsequent release "Baby Don't Take Your Love" reached #36 R&B and #96 in the Hot 100.Cusseaux left Faith, Hope and Charity in 1971, shortly after a label switch to Sussex Records, and started a solo career.  She was eventually replaced by Diane Destry in 1974.  Their biggest hit came with a switch to RCA Records in the mid-1970s. With Van McCoy still writing and producing for the group, they hit the top of the R&B charts with "To Each His Own" (1975; #1 R&B, #15 Dance, #50 Hot 100).
They then scored another hit in January 1976, reaching #38 in the UK Singles Chart with "Just One Look" (from their album, Faith, Hope & Charity). It was a cover version of a Doris Troy track. Their single "Don't Pity Me" reached #20 on the R&B chart in 1978.
After a second album with RCA, which produced a couple of minor hits, Destry left, but Hilliard and Bailey carried on for another album in 1978, with 20th Century, before splitting up.It seemed that there was another member of Faith Hope & Charity in 1977. Priscilla Baskerville has been credited as being a member of the group on some recordings.

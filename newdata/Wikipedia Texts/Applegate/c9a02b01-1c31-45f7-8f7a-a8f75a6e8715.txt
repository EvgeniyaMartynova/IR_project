Applegate Valley AVA

The Applegate Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in southern Oregon.  It is entirely contained within the Rogue Valley AVA, which is itself included within the larger Southern Oregon AVA.  The region is named for the Applegate River, which flows through the town of Applegate and near the city of Jacksonville.  One of Oregon's first wineries (the winery has been restored and re-opened as Valley View Winery) was established in the Applegate Valley.  This region contains vineyards at altitudes ranging from 1,000 feet (300 m) to 1,500 feet (500 m) above sea level, and is warmer and drier than the Illinois Valley to the west, but less so than the Bear Creek Valley to the east.
Grapes that thrive here include Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tannat, Vermentino, Chardonnay, and Zinfandel.

The college offers certificate programmes in Accounting, Computer Technician, Electrical Technology, Computer Applications, Construction Technology and Hospitality Studies.
UCCI works with the Cayman Islands Society of Professional Accountants (CISPA) in defining the college's accounting programme, and as of September 2007 to offer Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Certified General Accountant (CGA) and Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) review classes.
Reviewing the first year of UCCI's Certified Accounting Technician programme, CISPA considered that it had been successful, although some changes could be made to better prepare students for their first work experience.The University College offers Associate of Arts, Associate of Sciences and Associate of Applied Sciences courses, followed by degree programmes leading to BSc degrees in Business Administration, Computer Science, Natural Science and Social Science, and Bachelor of Education degrees.

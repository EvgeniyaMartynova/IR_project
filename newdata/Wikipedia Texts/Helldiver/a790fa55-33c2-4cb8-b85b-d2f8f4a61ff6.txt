ORFN

ORFN (born Aaron Curry, 1974 – December 7, 2016) was an American artist and reportedly "one of the most prolific graffiti writers in San Francisco Bay Area history." He was actively writing graffiti and making art in the Bay Area for over 25 years. ORFN commonly used many alternate monikers, including Sad Jose, Helldiver, Muddguts, Chainsaw, Phantasmagoria, Hungry Waif, and Very Viva Scout. He first gained notoriety for the sheer number of San Francisco “bus-flow” style tags he placed across the Bay Area, most of which were dated with the year in which they were done. However, his work evolved to include straightforward patterns and tone combinations that often featured smiling faces, sad children, cobwebs, skulls and other spooky imagery executed in a lo-fidelity, accessible, and playful manner. ORFN's work has drawn comparisons to that of Jean-Michel Basquiat, but unlike Basquiat, ORFN's work was very rarely included in formal displays. ORFN was a member of a number of graffiti crews, including US (Under Shadows), BKF (Big Kid Fun), DFW (Down for Whatever), 640, and BTM (Big Time Mob).

=== Beginnings ===
ORFN began experimentation with graffiti in middle school, initially spraying stencils in his then hometown of Palo Alto, CA. By 1992 ORFN had taken on his namesake moniker and started to make a name for himself as a graffiti writer in San Mateo County and the city of San Francisco, along with his early graffiti partner Revers.In 1992 ORFN joined the Bay Area-based US crew (which stands for Undeniable Sickness or Under Shadows), with Revers. ORFN continued to represent the US crew throughout his career, and as its leader since the early 2000s, was responsible for ensuring the continuity of the crew when it would have otherwise ceased to exist.


=== Sunset Tunnel Tags ===
ORFN spent years going into the Sunset Tunnel between Cole Valley and Duboce Park writing his moniker on one of the train tracks throughout the span of more than 4,000 feet.


=== Best Graffiti Tag, 1996 ===
ORFN was designated the “Best Graffiti Tag” in the 1996 “Best of the Bay” issue of SF Weekly, where it was noted that his tag was in view all over the San Francisco Bay Area.

ORFN moved to San Francisco in the mid 1990s to attend the San Francisco Art Institute for roughly one year. During the time he was in art school he was not actively writing graffiti.

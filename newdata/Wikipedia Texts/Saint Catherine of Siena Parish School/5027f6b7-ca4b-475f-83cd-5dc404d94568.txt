Portions of the township were taken to create Verona borough, based on the results of a referendum held on April 30, 1907. On April 9, 1908, the name was formally changed to Cedar Grove. The township's name derives from the cedar trees that once covered its valley and hillsides.


== History ==
Cedar Grove was part of the Horseneck Tract, which was an area that consisted of what are now the municipalities of Caldwell, West Caldwell, North Caldwell, Fairfield, Verona, Cedar Grove, Essex Fells, Roseland, and portions of Livingston and West Orange.
In 1702, settlers purchased the 14,000 acres (57 km2) Horseneck Tract — so-called because of its irregular shape that suggested a horse's neck and head — from the Lenni Lenape Native Americans for goods equal to $325. This purchase encompassed much of western Essex County, from the First Mountain to the Passaic River.
Cedar Grove was originally a small farming community. In 1896, Essex County built the county mental institution in Cedar Grove known as Overbrook. In 1908, Cedar Grove was incorporated as a township. In the 1950s and 1960s, Cedar Grove became one of the destination suburbs in Essex County among those looking to escape urban living from Newark and New York City.Cedar Grove was once home to Frank Dailey's Meadowbrook Ballroom, located on Route 23, which regularly hosted well-known bands and vocalists, including Buddy Rich, Glenn Miller, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Frank Sinatra, and Jo Stafford. The ballroom, located on the old Pompton Turnpike, still stands, and is used by Sts. Kiril & Methodij Macedonian Orthodox Church.The first Dinner Theatre was opened at The Meadowbrook on Route 23 in the fall of 1959 by Gary and Helga McHugh. It closed in 1973. An extensive web site about The Meadowbrook Dinner Theatre contains a listing of the productions done there, playbills from the productions, hundreds of photographs, and other information about the operation and its history.

The center of the township is in a valley that is about 280 feet (85 m) above sea level; however, many sections of Cedar Grove are well above 400 feet (120 m), including the Park Ridge Estates, the abandoned Essex County Hospital Center, and the eastern, southeastern and southern sections of Cedar Grove. Cedar Grove's highest point is on hilltop, where elevations reach 600 feet (180 m) and above. Cedar Grove is located approximately 12 miles (19 km) west of Midtown Manhattan and 4 miles (6.4 km) northwest of Newark.
Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Lindsley and Overbrook.
Cedar Grove is bordered by the  municipalities of Montclair, North Caldwell and Verona in Essex County; and Little Falls in Passaic County. Most of the eastern portion of the township is bordered by Upper Montclair (a neighborhood in Montclair).


=== Neighborhoods ===
The sections of Cedar Grove are:
North End: The North End of Cedar Grove starts after the corner of Fairview Avenue and Pompton Avenue.  It consists mostly of homes, but there are some businesses located on Pompton Avenue, and at the corner of E. Lindsley Road and Stevens Avenue.  A notable part of the north end of town is the Park Ridge Estates, which contains million-dollar homes.
Central Cedar Grove: This consists of the center of town and extends from the corner of Fairview Avenue and Pompton Avenue to the corner of Bradford Avenue and Pompton Avenue.  The central portion of the town contains Cedar Grove's business district. Also, on the west central side of town is the former location of the Essex County Hospital Center, and on the east central side is the Cedar Grove Reservoir and Mills Reservation.
South End: The south end of Cedar Grove is the most urbanized part of the township, as it contains homes that are closer together.  The south end extends from the corner of Bradford Avenue and Pompton Avenue to the Verona border.

Like the north end of town, the south end contains a section of million dollar homes.
Cedar Grove's population density is less than the surrounding towns of Montclair, Verona, and Little Falls, mainly because significant portions of Cedar Grove are owned or previously owned by county or city governments.

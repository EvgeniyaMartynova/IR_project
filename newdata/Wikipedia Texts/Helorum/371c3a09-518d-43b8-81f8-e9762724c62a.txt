List of Book of Mormon people

This list is intended as a quick reference for individuals mentioned in the Book of Mormon.


== Notation ==
Names with superscripts (e.g., Nephi1) are numbered according to the index in the LDS scripture, the Book of Mormon. Missing indices indicate people in the index who are not in the Book of Mormon; for instance, Aaron1 is the biblical Aaron, brother of Moses.

Bold type indicates the person was an important religious figure, such as a prophet or a missionary.
Italic type indicates the person was a king, chief judge or other ruler.
Underlined type indicates the person was a historian or record keeper; one whose writing (abridged or not) is included in The Book of Mormon.
Combined typefaces indicate combined roles. For example, bold italic indicates an individual was both a religious and secular leader.

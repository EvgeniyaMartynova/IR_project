Jagged Edge (Jagged Edge album)

Jagged Edge is an American R&B group signed through Jermaine Dupri's So So Def Recordings. Their biggest hit singles are "Let's Get Married" and "Where the Party At", many of which were produced by Jermaine Dupri. The group's members include identical twin lead singers Brandon and Brian Casey as well as Kyle Norman and Richard Wingo. The group's name derives from Track 12 - "Snake" from rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard's debut album Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version. More specifically, the beginning of The RZA's verse which states, "Jagged Edge, Rockhead God, hard as Stonehenge..." 
Wingo was a late addition to the group, added after a recommendation from Kandi Burruss of Xscape. Burruss was also the one who brought the group to the attention of Dupri, who signed them to his Columbia Records distributed imprint, So So Def Recordings.

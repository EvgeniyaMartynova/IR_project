How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye

How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye is an album recorded by Dionne Warwick, her sixth for the Arista label. It was recorded during the spring of 1983 and was released that fall. The LP was originally issued as number AL 8-8104 in the Arista Catalog. 
Despite strong reviews, it was a commercial disappointment, stalling at number 57 on Billboard's album chart. Two singles came from the album, 'How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye?' (a duet with album producer Luther Vandross) which hit #4 Adult Contemporary and #27 on Billboard's Hot 100 and Got a Date which hit #45 on Billboard's R&B chart.


== History ==
The album was produced by R&B singer and songwriter Luther Vandross and included the hit title track, which was a duet with Vandross.  The title track was also featured on Vandross' own Busy Body album.  The album includes the original version of the song "So Amazing", which Vandross would record later for his Give Me the Reason album. In 2014 a Remastered Expanded Edition was released by Funkytowngrooves.

15th

15 (fifteen) is a number, numeral, and glyph. It is the natural number following 14 and preceding 16.


== Mathematics ==
15 is:

a triangular number.
a hexagonal number.
a pentatope number.
the 5th Bell number (i.e. the number of partitions for a set of size 4).
a composite number; its proper divisors being 1, 3 and 5.
the number of supersingular primes.
a repdigit in binary (1111) and quaternary (33). In hexadecimal, as well as all higher bases, 15 is represented as F.
the smallest number that can be factorized using Shor's quantum algorithm.
the magic constant of the unique order-3 normal magic square:
There are 15 perfect matchings of the complete graph K6 and 15 rooted binary trees with four labeled leaves, both of these being among the types of object counted by double factorials.
With only two exceptions, all prime quadruplets enclose a multiple of 15, with 15 itself being enclosed by the quadruplet (11, 13, 17, 19). 

Because 15 is the product of distinct Fermat primes, 3 and 5, a regular polygon with 15 sides is constructible with compass and unmarked straightedge, and cos π/15 is expressible in terms of square roots (see here).
If a positive definite quadratic form with integer matrix represents all positive integers up to 15, then it represents all positive integers via the 15 and 290 theorems.
15 contains the decimal digits 1 and 5, and is the result of adding together the integers from 1 to 5 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15)

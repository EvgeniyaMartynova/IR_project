St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church (Silver Spring, Maryland)

Saint John the Evangelist Catholic Church is a parish of the Roman Catholic Church in Maryland in the United States founded by Fr. John Carroll in 1774. It falls under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Washington and its archbishop. It is named after John the Evangelist.


== History ==
The community has existed for well over 200 years, and was the first secular church in the United States. Its first chapel was built on land owned by Carroll's mother. The parish currently owns two separate church buildings, known as the "Main" or "New Church" located at 10103 Georgia Ave Silver Spring, MD 20902, built in 1962 and the "Historic" or "Old Church" located at 9700 Rosensteel Ave. Forest Glen, MD 20910, built in 1894. The "historic" church is currently used by no less than three congregations: St. John the Evangelist, Our Lady Queen of Poland and St. Maximillian Kolbe Parish, and a Traditional Latin Mass Congregation.  The pastor of Our Lady Queen of Poland and St. Maximillian Kolbe is Fr. Jan Fiedurek of the Society of Christ.
The church/school community offers First Communion, Sunday School, grades Pre-Kindergarten through 8, and reconciliation. The current principal of the school is Sister Kathleen Lannak. Across from the school, there is also a convent that consists of nuns who are Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (I.H.M.).
In Cardinal James Gibbons' speech at the laying the cornerstone of the old church at Forest Glen, he stated that St. John the Evangelist was "...the Bethlehem of the church in America..." with the understood metaphor of Baltimore being the Jerusalem.

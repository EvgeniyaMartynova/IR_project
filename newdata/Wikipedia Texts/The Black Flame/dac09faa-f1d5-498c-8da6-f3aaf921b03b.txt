The Black Flame (magazine)

The Black Flame is a magazine published by the Church of Satan. It was launched in 1989, when another of the Church's publications, The Cloven Hoof, went on hiatus.  Originally, The Black Flame was a quarterly newsletter, but it then evolved into a bi-annual publication.

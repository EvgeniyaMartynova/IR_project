Adenylylsulfate—ammonia adenylyltransferase

In enzymology, an adenylylsulfate-ammonia adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.51) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction adenylyl sulfate + NH3 
  
    
      
        ⇌
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
   adenosine 5'-phosphoramidate + sulfate.
Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are adenylyl sulfate and NH3, whereas its two products are adenosine 5'-phosphoramidate and sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases).  The systematic name of this enzyme class is adenylyl-sulfate:ammonia adenylyltransferase. Other names in common use include APSAT, and adenylylsulfate:ammonia adenylyltransferase.

Well End, Buckinghamshire

Well End is a hamlet in the parish of Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is situated on the north-west side of the village of Bourne End. Although it lies in a separate parish, it is geographically contiguous with and subordinate to Bourne End; but unlike most of the hamlets consumed by its larger neighbour, it retains a distinct character, and the use of the name is common and well recognised locally.
The area was once known as Fontibus de Merlow, (Marlow Fountain), of which Well End is a likely etymological derivative.
It is endowed with Abbotsbrook Hall, a small, parish council-owned venue used for community events. The local hostelry is The Black Lion situated on Marlow Road. Claytons School, the junior school serving Well End and Bourne End, is sited locally on Wendover Road. There is nearby access to the Little Marlow Gravel Pits nature reserve and to the River Thames towpath.
Well End was formerly home to a Congregationalist mission hall and The Blacksmiths Arms public house.

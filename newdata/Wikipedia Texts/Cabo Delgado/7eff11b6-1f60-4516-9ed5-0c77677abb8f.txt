== History ==

On 25 September 1964, Frelimo guerrillas arrived from Tanzania, with help from some individuals of the surrounding population, attacking a Portuguese administrative post in the province. This raid marked the beginning of the Portuguese Colonial War, the armed struggle between the Portuguese colonial authorities in the then Portuguese Overseas Province of Mozambique. This province was the focus of Operation Gordian Knot, where the Portuguese colonials attempted to wipe out the guerrilla bases in the province.
The province is named after Cape Delgado (Portuguese: Cabo Delgado), a coastal headland on the border between Mozambique and Tanzania, which forms the northernmost point in Mozambique.

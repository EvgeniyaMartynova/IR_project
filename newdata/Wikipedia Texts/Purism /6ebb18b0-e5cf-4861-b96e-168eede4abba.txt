Purism (company)

Purism, SPC is a computer technology social purpose corporation based in South San Francisco, California and registered in the state of Washington. Purism manufactures the Librem personal computing devices with a focus on software freedom, computer security, and Internet privacy.


== History ==
Purism was founded in 2014 with the start of a crowdfunding campaign for the Librem 15, an attempt to manufacture an Intel-based high-end laptop for Linux with "almost no proprietary software". A second campaign funded development of a 13-inch model with hardware switches to disable the microphone and camera as a privacy feature. Kill switches were also added to the 15-inch model.
The two campaigns raised US$1,052,174 from 1,042 initial backers, and production began at the end of 2015. In 2017 Purism announced its transition from a build to order to a build to stock order fulfillment model.Purism reincorporated as a social purpose corporation in February 2017 and announced the change in May.On August 24 2017, Purism announced plans to build a smartphone, the Librem 5, with a baseband processor separate from the main CPU, with hardware kill switches for the baseband, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, camera, and microphone, and running only free and open-source software. A 60-day crowdfunding campaign raised US$1.5 million for the phone.


== Products ==


=== PureOS ===
Purism manages development of PureOS, a fully free Linux distribution based on Debian. PureOS mostly ships with software from the Debian software repository but has all software removed that violates Purism's guidelines. Most notably, the Mozilla Firefox web browser is rebranded as PureBrowser and ships with plug-ins to enhance user privacy. PureOS was endorsed by the Free Software Foundation in December 2017. Librem laptops ship with PureOS by default and an optional Qubes OS Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive. Purism says that it is easy for Librem owners to install alternative Linux distributions and that owners have the freedom to install any operating system that they wish to install.


=== Librem hardware ===

Librem is the brand name used by Purism for all of their computer hardware products since the firm's first website in late 2014. The name is based on the French word Libre for the English word free as used in the term libre software for free software.
Purism devices feature hardware kill switches to allow users to shut off the camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular or mobile broadband modem on devices that have one (or can be purchased air gapped).
Librem does its best to remove Intel's Management Engine, considering it a security problem.


==== Laptops: Librem 13 and 15 ====
Purism's first products were two laptop computers. Since late 2015, they have made laptops of two sizes: Librem 13 and 15, featuring a 13 and a 15 inch screen, respectively. These products ship with Purism's own operating system, PureOS, a derivative of Debian GNU/Linux, and an optional Qubes OS USB drive.


===== Comparison of laptops =====


==== Tablet: Librem 11 ====
Purism has proposed a 2-in-1 PC, a convertible, hybrid, tablet-to-laptop computer: the Librem 11, sometimes termed Librem 10 or 12. It would have an 11-inch touchscreen in an 11.6-inch body with a detachable keyboard, and an optional docking station. Development on the device began in April 2016 and was suspended in October 2018 to focus on the Librem 5 smartphone.


==== Smartphone: Librem 5 ====

The Librem 5 is Purism's first smartphone. They began a funding campaign on 24 August 2017, for a $599 "security and privacy focused phone" Librem 5. The 60-day funding campaign aimed to collect US$1.5 million, however the goal was surpassed two weeks early and concluded with US$2,677,609.10 raised, 78% over the goal. The phone would run entirely free firmware and software: Debian derivative with a choice of desktop environments GNOME, KDE Plasma Mobile, or Ubuntu Touch. Further, unlike in any other phone, the baseband processor will be separated from the CPU main bus and instead connected via a fast USB interface, thus isolated from the main CPU RAM bus. Also, the phone will feature hardware kill switches for the isolated baseband processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, camera, and microphone. On September 24, 2019, Purism announced that the first batch of Librem 5 phones had started shipping.


==== Librem Key ====
The Librem Key is a hardware USB security token with many features, including integration with tamper-evident Heads Firmware. Heads helps to ensure that the Librem laptop's BIOS was not altered since the last laptop boot. The Librem Key also holds a one-time password storage (3x HOTP (RFC 4226), 15 x TOTP (RFC 6238)), integrated password manager (16 entries), 40 kbit/s true random number generator, and tamper-resistant smart card. The key supports type A USB 2.0, has dimensions of 48 mm × 19 mm × 7 mm (1.89 in × 0.75 in × 0.28 in), and weights 6 grams (0.21 oz).


=== Librem One ===
Librem One is a paid-subscription, free-software social-networking suite launched April 30, 2019 to bring decentralized, privacy-respecting applications to a wider user base. The first components released were Librem Mail supporting OpenPGP standards using a K-9-based client; Librem Tunnel based on OpenVPN; Librem Social microblogging using Mastodon server and Tusky-based client software federated via the ActivityPub protocol; and Librem Chat using Riot.im software federated via Matrix and XMPP, with Librem Files file sharing and other services planned.

== Overview ==


=== Article layout ===
The list is presented alphabetically by County. Foundations are listed alphabetically within each county.

Communities/provenance: shows the status and communities existing at each establishment, together with such dates as have been established as well as the fate of the establishment after dissolution, and the current status of the site.
Formal Name or Dedication: shows the formal name of the establishment or the person in whose name the church is dedicated, where known.
Alternative Names: some of the establishments have had alternative names over the course of time. In order to assist in text-searching such alternatives in name or spelling have been provided.
Monastic Glossary: following the listing, provides links to articles on the particular monastic orders as well as other terms which appear in the listing.
In this article smaller establishments such as cells and notable monastic granges (particularly those with resident monks) and camerae of the military orders of monks (Templars and Hospitallers) are included. The numerous monastic hospitals per se are not included here unless at some time the foundation had, or was purported to have, the status or function of an abbey, priory, friary or preceptory/commandery.

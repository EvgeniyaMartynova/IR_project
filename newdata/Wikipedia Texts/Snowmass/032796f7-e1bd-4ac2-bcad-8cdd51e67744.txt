Snowmass (ski area)

Snowmass is a ski resort located in the town of Snowmass Village near Aspen, Colorado.   The ski area is owned and operated by the Aspen Skiing Company as part of the  Aspen/Snowmass complex. It was opened on December 17, 1967
. Snowmass is the largest of the four Aspen/Snowmass mountains, comprising 3,128 acres (1,266 ha). The mountain is most notable for its wide cruiser runs, family-friendly atmosphere, and extensive ski-in/ski-out lodging. Despite its family reputation, the resort also contains several terrain parks, extensive extreme skiing terrain, mogul runs, and gladed terrain.
Snowmass has undergone massive changes in the past few years, including a new gondola along with a new Base Village.  Snowmass has also constructed a new restaurant near Elk Camp, replacing Cafe Suzanne with a large, brand new restaurant. Today, Snowmass continues its extensive improvements to on-mountain infrastructure as well as lift repairs.
Snowmass has the most vertical feet of skiing of any ski area in the United States, but only when the Cirque poma is running.  There are 17 lifts at Snowmass: 8 high-speed quads (Two Creeks, Elk Camp, Alpine Springs, Sheer Bliss, Big Burn, Coney Glade, Sam's Knob, High Alpine), 1 high-speed six pack (Village Express), 2 gondolas (the Sky Cab - better known as the "Skittles" and Elk Camp Gondola), 2 quads (Meadows and Assay Hill), 1 double (Campground) and 2 pull lifts (Scooper and The Cirque).

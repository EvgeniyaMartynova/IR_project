Applause Records

Applause Records was a short-lived record label featuring popular standards performers, nearly all of them vocalists. It was founded in Beverly Hills, California, in 1981 by record company executive and music publisher Arthur Mogull. The label released albums by Shirley Bassey, Steve Lawrence, Eydie Gorme, Sammy Davis Jr., Robert Goulet, Vic Damone, Jack Jones, Tony Martin, The Lettermen and Peter Nero.
In December 1981 Peggy Lee said she was considering joining the label, although she never did.
A 1988 newspaper story gave Steve Lawrence credit for founding Applause Records, saying he did so "out of acute frustration."
In 1990 the Lewis Horowitz Company, which provided funding for the label, foreclosed on it and was assigned the catalog. Horowitz  sold the catalog to William Brown Associates in 1997; that company was acquired by Reach Entertainment in 1999, with Reach itself acquired by Tom Ficara and Margate Entertainment in 2005. 
Artists on the Applause label include the Stardust Dance Band, The Skruffy Group, Norwood, and Joe Cano. In addition, the Boomin' Reunion series includes new recordings of their original hits from Chuck Jackson, Ernie K Doe, Jean Knight, Frankie Ford, Mel Carter, Lou Christie, Len Barry, Donnie Brooks, Merrilee Rush, Jewel Akens, Al Wilson, Bobby 'Boris' Pickett, Lenny Welch, Bruce Belland (Four Preps), Jim Yester (Association), J J Jackson, Ian Whitcomb, Mark Lindsay, Mitch Rider, Pete Rivera (Rare Earth), The Cufflinks, Spencer Davis, Chris Montez, John Gummoe (Cascades), and Brian Hyland.

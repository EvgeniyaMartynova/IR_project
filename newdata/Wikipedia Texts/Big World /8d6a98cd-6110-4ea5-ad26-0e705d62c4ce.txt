The Big World of Little Adam

The Big World of Little Adam was a series of television cartoons that debuted in syndication in 1964.In the early 1960s, producer Fred Ladd acquired a large number of NASA documentary short subjects and packaged them as 110 five-minute episodes.  Inexpensive animated wraparounds, featuring the inquisitive Little Adam and his older brother Wilbur, were added to open and close the segments.
The episodes were made available in syndication either as half-hour blocks or individually, often appearing interspersed within blocks of cartoons on local TV stations.

St. Francis Academy (Joliet, Illinois)

Joliet Catholic Academy (Joliet Catholic or JCA) is a coed Catholic High School located in Joliet, Illinois.  It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Joliet.  One of the oldest Catholic high schools in the Chicago area, Joliet Catholic is perhaps best known for its prowess in football.  Since the advent of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) state football playoffs in 1974, JCA has won more state football titles than any other team in the state, with 14 as of 2018.
The modern school is itself the result of a merger between the all-girls St. Francis Academy and the all-male Joliet Catholic High School, which itself was formerly known as DeLaSalle High School for Boys.  It is this merger that results in the school's shared affiliation with the Carmelites and the Joliet Franciscan Sisters.


== History ==
The Joliet Franciscan Sisters opened St. Francis Academy in 1869 as an all-girls school.  The academy was founded in a small stone building convent by Mother Mary Alfred Moes, who later would help found the Mayo Clinic.  In 1923, the school moved to the campus of the University of St. Francis, which had opened in 1920.  In 1956, the school moved to the building at 1200 N. Larkin, which is the current site of JCA.
George Cardinal Mundelein, Archbishop of Chicago, had the De La Salle Christian Brothers create a new high school for boys as a part of their renovation of St. Patrick Church in Joliet.  The school opened in 1918 as DeLaSalle High School for Boys with only two classrooms in the parish center, but moved to a new building in 1927.  In 1933, the Carmelites took possession of the school, at which time, the school became Joliet Catholic High School.
In the summer of 1990, Joliet Catholic High School and St. Francis Academy merged to form the modern Joliet Catholic Academy.

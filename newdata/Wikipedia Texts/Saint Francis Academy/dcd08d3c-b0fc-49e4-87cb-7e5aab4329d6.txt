St. Francis Academy (San Antonio)

St. Francis Academy was an all-girls' Catholic senior high school in southern San Antonio, Texas.The Sisters of Saint Francis opened the school in 1960. The school closed in 2002, due to financial issues. It was the fifth Catholic school to be scheduled to close in a 10-year period ending in January 2002. After Saint Francis shut down, there were two all-girls' Catholic high schools remaining in San Antonio. After the closure of St. Francis the girls of southern and western San Antonio no longer had their own Catholic high school.The John H. Wood, Jr. Charter School System (now known as Braination) reopened the campus as a charter school in 2003.In the 2009-2010 school year Holy Cross of San Antonio, a previously all boys' secondary Catholic school serving the same areas that St. Francis did, opened its enrollment to girls.

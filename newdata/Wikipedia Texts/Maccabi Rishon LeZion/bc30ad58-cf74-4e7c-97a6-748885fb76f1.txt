=== Early years ===
The club was founded in 1976 by Itzhak Perry and reached the top division, where they have remained since in 1988–89 season. At the start of their first season in the top division, Israeli star Miki Berkovich joined Roni Bosani and Richy Ralford and they led the team. Their coach was Moshe Vainkretz and they finished the season in the 6th place. In the following season, Vainkretz was replaced by Tal Tzuker, and the team finished in the 9th place.


=== The 90's ===
In 1990–91, Vainkretz returned to Maccabi Rishon. With some high-quality players like Miki Berkovich, Gene Banks, Andre Spencer and Motti Aroesti, the team finished the regular season in the 2nd place of the league. In the semi-finals of the playoffs, Maccabi Rishon beat Hapoel Tel Aviv in a 3–0 sweep, and reached their first-ever final series. In the final, they lost in four games (3–1) to Maccabi Tel Aviv. One season later, in 1991–92, most of the key players stayed and the team ended the regular season again in the 2nd place. This time, they lost in the semi-finals series to Hapoel Tel Aviv.

At the end of the season, some key players such as Banks, Spencer, and Zlotikman left the team and because of it the team ended in 7th place during its 1992–93 campaign, and participated in the bottom playoffs.

=== 2000's ===
After they lost the first five games of 1999–00 season, Vainkretz resigned and was replaced by Hanan Keren. The club suffered from a lot of economic problems and injuries and finished the season in the 10th place. They were not relegated only because of the league expansion. 
In 2004–05, Guy Goodes, was appointed as head coach. The team lost to Maccabi Tel Aviv both in the league quarterfinals and in the semi-finals of the state cup. With Goodes as head coach, the team "recovered" from the difficult years before. Omar Sneed, John Gilchrist, Ryan Sidney and Lee Matthews joined as foreign players, the Israelis Or Eitan and Moran Roth joined also and they all led Rishon to success in 2005–06 season. Rishon Lezion finished the regular season in the 3rd place. They lost in the final four to Hapoel Jerusalem by a last-second shot of Horace Jenkins.

Rishon started the 2013–14 season very bad. The former assistant coach, Matan Harush, was appointed as head coach. He led the team for 11 games only winning 3 games.

Even with Sherf, the team suffered from instability. The team replaced a lot of players during the season, but Dawson, Hajaj and Solomon stayed. At the end of the season, Rishon and Sherf finished in 10th place from 12. They were saved from relegation by a last matchday win.
In the following season, the team finished the regular season in the 6th place. In the quarterfinals series, they beat Hapoel Holon (3:1) even without the home-court advantage. In the semi-finals series, they lost to Hapoel Jerusalem, 3:0.

The Gang's All Here (1939 film)

The Gang's All Here is a 1939 British, black-and-white, comedy-mystery, directed by Thornton Freeland and starring Jack Buchanan. It was produced by Associated British Picture Corporation. Subsequently, the film was released in the U.S. in 1943 with the title The Amazing Mr. Forrest.


== Synopsis ==
The dapper musical comedy favorite, Jack Buchanan is practically the whole show in The Gang's All Here. Buchanan plays John Forrest, a top investigator for the Stamford Insurance Company. Retiring from the firm, Forrest intends to devote the rest of his life to writing detective fiction, but this plan goes out the window when his former employers are robbed of $1,000,000 in jewels belonging to foreign potentate Prince Homouska (Walter Rilla). With the help of his befuddled butler Treadwell (Edward Everett Horton), Forrest follows the trail of clues to American gangster boss Alberni (Jack La Rue), capturing his quarry with a variety of slapstick subterfuges.

== Critical reception ==

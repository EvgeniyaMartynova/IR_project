=== Recent history ===
In 2003 alumnus Piers Sellers, a NASA astronaut, took a copy of the school charter into space with him.  A photo is exhibited in the school cafeteria. In 2005 Sellers opened the school's observatory, which is named after him.  This observatory houses the 22.5 inch Alan Young telescope operated by the Cranbrook and District Science and Astronomy Society (CADSAS). In May 2010 Sellers took into outer space aboard the Space Shuttle an original watercolour portrait of Cranbrook School painted by Brenda Barratt. The painting was later returned to Cranbrook School with the official NASA verification that it has travelled into space. In 2018, a new day house specifically for the 120 students in Years 7 and 8 was named after Piers Sellers.

=== Barham House ===
Barham House is the school’s main office. It contains the reception room, the offices of both the headmaster and the deputy head, and meeting rooms. The school medical centre is also in Barham House, but has its own reception and entrance. The building was originally the local vicarage.


=== The Library ===
Central to the school, there is a large library which is one of the oldest parts of the school. It was once the school hall, but it was converted to the library after the amount of pupils became to big to fit in the hall. School assemblies are currently held in the local church, St Dunstan’s, or the Queen’s Hall Theatre.


=== Queen’s Hall Theatre ===
The school is home to the local theatre, the Queen’s Hall. It is used for a number of both internal (performed and organised by students) and external productions, as well as some school assemblies. Many external productions are performed by Cranbrook Operatic and Dramatic Society (CODS). The school has their own technical team who help with most internal productions.

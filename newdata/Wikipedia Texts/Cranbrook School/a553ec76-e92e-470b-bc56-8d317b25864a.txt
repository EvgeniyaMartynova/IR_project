Cranbrook School, Ilford

Cranbrook was an independent co-educational school, located in Ilford, Greater London, England. The Cognita Group owned and operated the school until its closure in 2016. At that time the school covered the full range of academic years from Nursery to Year 11. Previously, in 2011, Cranbrook had merged with Glenarm College, another Cognita school in Ilford.


== History ==
Cranbrook School (formerly known as Cranbrook College) was founded in 1896 as a boys only school. The school was acquired by Cognita Schools Limited in April 2007.
In January 2011, Cranbrook and Glenarm Colleges integrated into a new site at Mansfield Rd, adjacent to the existing Cranbrook College campus. The schools, which shared the same founder, then re-branded themselves under the new title of Cranbrook and were fully co-educational.
Cranbrook School closed in July 2016 due to reduced pupil numbers.

Following the merger, the school had invested four million pounds into new building facilities.

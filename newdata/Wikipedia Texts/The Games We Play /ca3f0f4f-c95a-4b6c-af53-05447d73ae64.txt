Where the Heart Is (UK TV series)

Where the Heart Is is a British television family drama series set in the Yorkshire town of Skelthwaite. First shown in 1997, it was created by Ashley Pharoah and Vicky Featherstone and focuses on the professional and personal lives of the district nurses who work in the town. The original leads were Sarah Lancashire and Pam Ferris, who played sisters-in-law and colleagues at the Skelthwaite Health Centre. Both actresses had left the series by 2000, but the format of at least two female leads continued with various actresses until the show's end. A typical episode would focus on one or two medical storylines interwoven with personal stories featuring one or both nurses.
One of ITV's longest-running shows, Where the Heart Is was known for being what has been described as a haven for former soap stars, including Lancashire, Philip Middlemiss, Samantha Giles, Kerrie Taylor, Brian Capron and Shobna Gulati. In October 2006, the series was cancelled after nine years, despite viewing figures of well over 7 million.The theme song "Where the Heart is" was performed by Prefab Sprout (written and sung by Paddy McAloon). It was released as a single and appears on the band's 38 Carat Collection.
The series has been repeated on Drama.


== Synopsis ==
The show follows the lives of the people of Skelthwaite, a fictional small Yorkshire town; particularly the work of the district nurses at the town's health centre. It originally focuses on the extended Snow and Goddard family — sisters-in-law and close friends Peggy Snow (Ferris) and Ruth Goddard (Lancashire) who work together as district nurses, while Ruth's husband and Peggy's younger brother Simon (Thomas Craig) is the town's main employer through his paper products factory. Peggy's husband Vic (Tony Haygarth) and her children Stephen and Lucy provide family-focused storylines which sit alongside the medical-based plots.
The programme underwent major changes at the end of series three and the beginning of series four, with first Lancashire and then Ferris departing. Ruth and Simon split, with Ruth moving to Australia and Peggy tragically dies following a road accident involving a horse which also left her daughter Lucy fighting for her life. Storylines continued to focus on the rest of the family, with Simon and Vic adjusting to life as single men and for Vic, as a single father, whilst old friends Anna Kirkwall (Lesley Dunlop) and Karen Buckley (Leslie Ash) take over at the health centre. Anna begins a romance with Simon, but rejects him just before their wedding day, knowing that he wants to be with Ruth and Alfie in Australia. Karen's marriage to her husband David (Philip Middlemiss) crumbles when she chooses to focus on helping her long-lost son recover from his drug addiction, leading to Ash's departure from the series in 2003. Anna and David later become a couple, marry and remain the show's lead characters for the rest of its run.
Several other nurses work alongside Anna during this time, most notably Sally Boothe (Samantha Giles), whose family becomes the focus of many of the non-medical storylines after the remaining members of the Snow family departed in 2002. In an echo of the Snow family's development, Sally is also killed off, with later storylines focusing on her family's attempts to cope without her.
Over the years the cast was expanded and the show became more of an ensemble drama, with typically three major nurse characters at any one time alongside other townsfolk, usually workers at Goddard's Paper Products and their families.


== Production ==
Thirteen of the episodes were written by the character actress and screenwriter Cecily Hobbs.
The series was filmed in the Colne and Holme valleys of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire using the real life villages of Marsden, Golcar, Slaithwaite, Milnsbridge and Meltham for many of the external shots. The first series was mostly filmed in Slaithwaite, with some exterior shots filmed in the village of Baildon, but from series 2 onwards, Marsden was used as the principal filming location.
The school used for filming was a local primary and junior school in Milnsbridge. The local park used in the scenes where Billy(Matthew Lewis) fell on the slide in earlier series was next door.

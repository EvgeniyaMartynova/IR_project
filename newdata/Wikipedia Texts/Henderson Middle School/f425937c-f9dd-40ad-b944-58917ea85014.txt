Henderson Independent School District is a public school district based in Henderson, Texas (USA).


== History ==
In early 1949 Henderson ISD's coverage area was 16 square miles (41 km2). Later in 1949 HISD began absorbing other area school districts. Motley, New Hope, Crim’s Chapel, Grandview, Roquemore, Oakland, Ebenezer, and Bethel were the first communities merged into Henderson ISD. Hickey joined the district in 1950. Pinehill joined the district in 1951. With the addition of Pinehill, Henderson ISD's coverage area was 137.7 square miles (357 km2). The district constructed a new Henderson High School building in 1953 due to the increased demand for a school building due to the new students coming from the consolidations.In 2006, voters approved a $22 million bond to build two new campuses — each more than 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) in size — on about 50 acres (200,000 m2) of land donated by the Wylie family of Henderson.In 2009, the school district was rated "academically acceptable" by the Texas Education Agency.In 2010, the Henderson Lion football team won the Texas 3-A Division 1 State Championship by defeating the Chapel Hill Bulldogs at Cowboys Stadium (AT&T Stadium) in Arlington, Texas.
Henderson High School's marching band became the 2012 3A state champions at the National Association of Military Marching Bands contest held in Bryan, Texas.
In 2013, voters approved the funding of a new middle school to be built in the same location as the old one. The 6th grade building will still be used but the 7th, and 8th grade buildings will be torn down and rebuilt on the middle schools practice field. Construction has not started as of March 23, 2014.
The Henderson High School Marching Band became the 2015 State Champions at the National Association of Military Marching Bands contest held in Carthage, Texas.

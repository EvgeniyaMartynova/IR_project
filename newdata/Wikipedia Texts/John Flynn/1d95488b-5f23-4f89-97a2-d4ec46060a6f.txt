John Flynn (Irish politician)

John Flynn (died 22 August 1968) was an Irish politician. A farmer by profession, he was first elected as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) at the 1932 general election for the Kerry constituency. He was re-elected at the 1933 general election for the same constituency and was elected for the Kerry South constituency at the 1937 and 1938 general elections.
He did not contest the 1943 and 1944 general elections. At the 1948 general election he was elected as an independent TD, and was re-elected at the 1951 general election, also as an independent. He re-joined the Fianna Fáil party. 
During a 1952 Dáil debate, after John A. Costello had said "I made no reference to an Adoption of Children Bill", Oliver J. Flanagan quipped "Deputy Flynn would be more qualified to do that". Flynn, who was not in the chamber at the time, interpreted this as an insulting innuendo, and later punched Flanagan in the Dáil restaurant. The Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privilege condemned the conduct of both TDs. Flynn was re-elected a Fianna Fáil TD at the 1954 general election. He stood as a Fianna Fáil candidate at the 1957 general election but was not re-elected.

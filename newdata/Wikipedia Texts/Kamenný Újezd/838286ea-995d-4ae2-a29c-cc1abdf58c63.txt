== Demography ==
As to ethnicity, Kamenný Újezd was traditionally a Czech settlement. The population grew in late 19th and early 20th centuries thanks to proximity of industrial centers of Rokycany and Hrádek (Rokycany District). It stagnates recently.


== History ==
The first written account of Kamenný Újezd dates from 1368. In 1498 king Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary confirmed that the village be part of Rokycany's feudal domain. It remained with patrimony of Rokycany until abolition of feudal administration in 1850. Local economy was based not only on agriculture but also on industry, namely iron ore mining and wood processing from nearby forests. The rural aspect of village's life was however important too. The village specialized in sheep farming. 19th and 20th century brought population increase and gradual transformation of Kamenný Újezd into semi-urban community influenced by proximity of industrial town of Rokycany. In 1868, Rokycany-Mirošov railway opened, initially for cargo transportation only. In May 1945 both American and Soviet armies reached Kamenný Újezd during liberation of Czechoslovakia in final days of World War II. For a short period between 1980 and 1990 the village merged with town of Rokycany but later seceded to become again a municipality of its own. Nowadays Kamenný Újezd, along with towns of Rokycany and Hrádek, forms contiguous chain of urban or semi-urban settlements along the Klabava River valley.

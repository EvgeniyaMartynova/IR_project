== Reception ==
Reviews were decidedly negative. In a review for Variety, Brian Lowry said Welcome to the Family was "a sitcom with all the depth of a knock-knock joke." The Washington Post's Hank Steuver anointed it as his "nominee for quickest and most punitive cancellation" and gave it an F. A writer for TV by the Numbers described the viewership as "dismal", falling to "anemic" by the second week.

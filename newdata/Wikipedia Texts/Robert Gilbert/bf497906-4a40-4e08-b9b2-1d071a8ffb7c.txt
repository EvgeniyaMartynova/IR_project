As a result, City became the first Irish League team to win a European Cup tie over two legs. In the first leg, played away on 31 August, Gilbert headed in two goals in a 5–3 defeat. However, he missed the return leg on 9 September because of injury, but Gilbert's two goals helped City to an 8–6 aggregate win.

During the summer of 1967, Gilbert also played for Rovers when they went to the United States and competed as Boston Rovers in the United Soccer Association league.One of the highlights of his time with Rovers came in November 1966 when Rovers came close to knocking, Bayern Munich, the eventual winners, out of the European Cup Winners Cup. After holding Bayern to a 1–1 draw at Dalymount Park, goals from Gilbert and Liam Tuohy saw Rovers came back from 2–0 down during the away game. Rovers were winning the tie on away goals when a late goal from Gerd Müller saw Bayern win 3–2 on the night and progress to the next round.

The gang is playing around the railroad yard when a fire breaks out. They hide in a railroad car and get trapped. The next morning they find out they have arrived in New York City. They soon are enjoying the sites, visiting the Brooklyn Bridge, the Statue of Liberty, and taking a sightseeing bus for a joyride, where they are finally caught by the police.
A police officer is assigned to take the gang back home on a train. They scatter the entomologist's bugs around the sleeper car during the night, and order exotic foods for breakfast.  They eventually arrive back home where their mothers greet them with a spanking.

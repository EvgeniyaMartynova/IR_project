"Mowgli's Road" originally appeared as a B-side to the single "Obsessions", which was released on 16 February 2009 by Neon Gold Records.The title is a reference to the character of the same name in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book story collection.


== Critical reception ==
Stuart Heritage of The Guardian wrote, "'Mowgli's Road' is odd. Think Gary Glitter, but if he kept pictures of The Wicker Man and some nice cutlery on his hard drive instead of that other stuff. This could easily be a hit; or, rather, the first couple of minutes could. Then it descends into a lunatic mixture of monkey wails, whistling and childlike nightmare mumbles that may well be responsible for my chronic insomnia."


== Music video ==
The music video for "Mowgli's Road" was directed by Chris Sweeney and released onto YouTube on 20 October 2009. The video features Diamandis and two girls with origami limbs and torso dancing in a spotlight with a white screen. In the second verse, Diamandis sings into a microphone on a stand. It begins with Diamandis standing without lighting and stomping her origami legs to the beat of the music. When the lighting comes on, Diamandis begins singing and moving her origami legs; two female dancers with the same legs appear and dance with her. After the repeat of the chorus, Diamandis is shown with her origami torso, bouncing up and down while singing the third verse. While the music continues in the song, Diamandis and the dancers dance with all limbs in origami form. The video ends with the lighting of the set going out and they all stand as Diamandis was in the beginning.

Uduk language

Uduk, also known as Tw'ampa (T'wampa), is a Koman language spoken in Sudan near the border with Ethiopia.  Nearly the entire population fled to a refugee camp in Ethiopia during the Second Sudanese Civil War, but returned to Sudan once fighting stopped. The resurgence of hostilities in the Blue Nile province after 2011 once more resulted in the Uduk community to enter refugee camps in Ethiopia and South Sudan.

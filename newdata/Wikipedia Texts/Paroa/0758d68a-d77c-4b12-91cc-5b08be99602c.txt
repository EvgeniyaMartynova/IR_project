Paroa, West Coast

Paroa is a settlement on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, just south of Greymouth.  State Highway 6 and the Hokitika Branch railway both run through Paroa.  This railway was originally a bush tramway that opened to Paroa from Greymouth in 1867 and was extended to Kumara in 1877.  It was converted into a railway in 1893, and this time, ran from Paroa to Hokitika rather than Kumara.The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of "broad fortified village" for PƒÅroa.Shantytown, to the south-east of Paroa, is a recreation of a typical 1880s West Coast gold mining town, built in 1971 and operating as a commercial tourist attraction.

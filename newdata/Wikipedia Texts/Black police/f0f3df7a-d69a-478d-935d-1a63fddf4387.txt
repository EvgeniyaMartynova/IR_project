== Plot ==


=== Part 1 ===
The movie starts off with an African Canadian cop (Ronnie Rowe) recalling his childhood. When he was young, a little boy called him a name relating to a candy bar and he did nothing. After hearing this offensive name multiple times he eventually responded with picking up his textbook and beating him over the head with it. During this part he makes remarks on how his race alienates him because he is a cop: His father (who died before he got his badge) told his son that if you are ever stopped by the police even for the time you should put your hands up and freeze. He ends this part by saying that he never really did listen to his father.


== Awards and accolades ==
At the 2017 Vancouver International Film Festival, Black Cop won the award for Best Canadian Feature Film. At the 6th Canadian Screen Awards in 2018, the film won the John Dunning Discovery Award.

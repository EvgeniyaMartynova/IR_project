Hong Kong Black Police

Hong Kong Black Police is a Hong Kong epithet used by citizens to voice condemnation and anger against the police force, where "black" refers to black deeds including excessive use of force.


== Definition and definition change ==
Originally, the term "black police" was first used to describe members of the Hong Kong Police Force who were complicit in criminal activities or engaged with criminal activities. It is now used to criticise police behaviour during dealings with social movement and activist groups. Use of the expression is mainly found on the Internet and social media.
Following 2011 political protests, the expression now refers to Hong Kong Police Force members who take a political stance and use their power to abuse and suppress those with different political views. Thus, the term mocks the enforcement activities of the police as well as drawing a parallel between their behaviour and that of triad members. The new definition originated during the visit of Li Keqiang after the Hong Kong 818 Incident. Police were accused of using unduly harsh methods to handle dissenting demonstrators. Following the Umbrella Movement and the 16 Mong Kok civil unrest, the use of the term "black police" became more widespread and now used to cover both police who commit crimes, and police are viewed to abuse their authority in dealing with political protesters. The new definition was widely understood by the time of the 2014 Hong Kong protests.In the 2019 Hong Kong protests, protesters combined "黑" (haak) and "警" (ging) into a single character to suggest that the police worked together with criminal triads to attack them.

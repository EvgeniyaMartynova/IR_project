Dutchland earned their first WFTDA-sanctioned victory on June 13, 2009, 206-75 against the Long Island Roller Rebels. At the 2010 WFTDA Eastern Regional Tournament, Dutchland fell to Providence Roller Derby, Montreal Roller Derby and DC Rollergirls to finish in tenth place. At the 2011 Eastern Regional, Dutchland opened with a 198-117 victory over Maine Roller Derby, positioning them to face top-seeded Gotham Girls Roller Derby in the quarterfinal. However, in a move widely considered to be controversial, Dutchland opted to forfeit their game against Gotham, determining it would be better for the team's final performance in other games to not play a game they expected to lose by a wide margin. The forfeit was ultimately scored a 100-0 victory for Gotham. Dutchland next played in the consolation round against Montreal, losing 225-124 in a game in which the crowd often expressed its feelings about the forfeit. After a 213-90 loss to Boston Derby Dames Dutchland finished the weekend in eighth place. At the 2012 Eastern Regional, Dutchland lost to Carolina Rollergirls and Montreal, before finishing in tenth place after a 476-107 loss to Steel City Derby Demons.

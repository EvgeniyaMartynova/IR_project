Will C. Crawford High School

Will C. Crawford High School, also known as Crawford High School and formerly Crawford Educational Complex, is a high school located in the El Cerrito neighborhood of San Diego, California United States. In the fall of 2012, the school was reorganized as a traditional school with one principal and two vice principals, and returned to its original name, Will C. Crawford High School.
It is part of the San Diego Unified School District.  Erected in 1957 and dedicated in 1958, it is a comprehensive school serving 1,500 students in grades 9–12.


== History ==


=== Naming ===
The school was named after Dr. Will C. Crawford, Superintendent of the San Diego Unified Schools from 1934 to 1954. It was officially opened during a dedication ceremony on April 27, 1958.


=== Mascot and Colors ===
In 1957, the incoming Horace Mann Junior High School graduating 9th grade class and transfer students from Hoover High School formed the 10th and 11th grade classes (at the time, the school was 10th through 12th grade). There was no 12th grade the first year.  The entire student body of Crawford High School decided on the school colors and mascot. Crimson, white and blue were chosen. The mascot was chosen in line with Dr. Crawford's other career as an Air Force pilot; the student body voted for it to be some kind of aircraft or bird. To keep with the rivalry with Hoover High School (whose mascot was the Cardinal), and because the yearbook was named Centaur, it was decided that the mascot would be the Colt. The alma mater was later written, and the Pacer newspaper was founded.


=== Crawford Educational Complex ===
Crawford High School reopened in 2004 as the Crawford Educational Complex through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It consisted of four schools within a school: the School of Law and Business (LAB), Multimedia and Visual Arts School (MVAS), Invention and Design Educational Academy (IDEA) and the School of Community Health and Medical Practices (CHAMPs). The small schools were closed due to district budget cuts, and the school returned to a comprehensive campus in the fall of 2012.


=== 50th anniversary ===
In the 2007-2008 school year, Crawford celebrated its 50th anniversary. The campus was repainted blue and crimson by the end of the school year.
The automotive department was reopened and rededicated by State Superintendent of Instruction Jack O'Connell. The department achieved NATEF (National Automotive Technician Education Foundation) certification on the one-year anniversary of its opening.


=== 2010's ===
The school established a "restorative justice" program in 2014.


=== Reconstruction ===
In 2015, San Diego Unified School District announced a modernization project, with new athletic fields and improvements at Horace Mann Middle School & Will C. Crawford High School. The project began in the 2015-2016 school year.


== Feeder schools ==

== Curriculum ==
Crawford High consists of a 4x4 block schedule, which means that students are able to complete four full classes a semester (fall term and spring term) totaling eight full classes a year, rather than the traditional six year-long courses. This enables students to complete a full year's curriculum in a more condensed term, allowing them to enroll in additional electives or ROP courses.


== Community service requirements ==
All students are required to complete 20 to 40 hours of community service a year. Opportunities for community service are available through on or off campus organizations, or students may complete this requirement independently. On-campus organizations include Division 11 Key Club, a community service organization which recently returned to Crawford during the 2010–2011 school year; Peer Helping, the largest and most active service organization started by teacher Julie Reinhardt in the early 1990s; and Auroras, a senior honor society (requiring a GPA over 3.0) specializing in service, which has been on campus since the 1960s. Crawford boasts its own garden, and internships are available to current students. Off-campus organizations include the San Diego Asian Youth Organization and the East African Youth Organization, both based at the UPAC center. Community service requirements were put forth in an effort to boost college acceptances.


== Centaur ==
Centaur is Crawford's award-winning, nationally recognized yearbook. It consistently takes best of class and places in the top two at the San Diego County Fair and other contests. A centaur is a Greek mythological creature that is half human and half horse.

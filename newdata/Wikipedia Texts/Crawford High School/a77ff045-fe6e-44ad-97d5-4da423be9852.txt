The oldest is "Classroom Building A" from about 1942.  It has a four-room plan very similar to the Rosenwald Fund's standard plan for a "Four Teacher Community School to Face East or West", although its windows actually face north and south instead.  It is built of concrete blocks on a concrete foundation the a gable roof having deep eaves. "Classroom Building B", built about 1955, was used for business and typing classes. It is a one-story, wood-frame structure with a red brick veneer laid in running bond.  The 1951 Classroom and Administration building has "mid-century modern aesthetic is asserted through the horizontality of the design, its flat roof with deep eaves and its clean, sharp lines."

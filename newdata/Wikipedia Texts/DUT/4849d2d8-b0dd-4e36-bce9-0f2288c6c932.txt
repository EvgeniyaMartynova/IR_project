Diplôme universitaire de technologie

The Instituts universitaires de technologie or IUT (translated as "University Institutes of Technology") are part of the university system in France. The IUT were created in 1966. As of 2008, there are 116 IUTs which are attached to 80 universities including the ones in the French Overseas Territories and Departments.
The IUTs allow the preparation of a two-year undergraduate technical diploma called a Diplôme universitaire de technologie or DUT.
After finishing their DUT, students have the option to work, do a one-year professional degree called "Licence Professionnelle" (a course also offered by IUTs), or further their studies in a university or "école".

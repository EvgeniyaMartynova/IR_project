The Brazilian city of Crato was named in honor to Crato, a Portuguese town which was founded in the 13th century.
The people of Crato credit their city's blossoming to a priest, Padre Cicecero, who was outcast from the nearby town of Juazeiro do Norte in the late 1800s and settled in Crato with his various followers thereafter. Various images and statues of the priest can be found around Crato as a sign of appreciation for the priest.

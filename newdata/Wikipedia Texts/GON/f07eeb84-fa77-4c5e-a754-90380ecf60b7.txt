Gon Freecss

The Hunter × Hunter manga series features an extensive cast of characters created by Yoshihiro Togashi. It takes place in a fictional universe where licensed specialists known as Hunters travel the world taking on special jobs ranging from treasure hunting to assassinations. The story initially focuses on 11-year-old Gon Freecss and his quest to become a Hunter in order to find his father, Ging, who is himself a famous Hunter. On the way, Gon meets and becomes close friends with Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight, who all aim to become Hunters for their own reasons, and catches the attention of the murderous magician Hisoka.
After becoming licensed, they clash with a gang of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe, before Gon and Killua enter the video game Greed Island in search of clues to find Ging. The two then immediately get involved in stopping the man-eating Chimera Ants from taking over mankind. Kurapika, Leorio and the other Zodiacs, a group of high-ranking Hunters, then begin escorting the Kakin Royal Family and Beyond Netero on an expedition to the unexplored Dark Continent. However, the ship ride is the start of a deadly game of succession among the princes to determine who will be the next king of Kakin.
Although the characters are humans, most possess superhuman strength and/or supernatural abilities due to Nen, the ability to control one's own life energy or aura. The world of the series also includes fantastical beasts such as the Chimera Ants.


== Protagonists ==


=== Gon Freecss ===
Voiced by: Rica Matsumoto (1998 film), Junko Takeuchi (1999 series, Japanese), Elinor Holt (1999 series, English), Megumi Han (2011 series, Japanese), Erica Mendez (2011 series, English)Gon Freecss (Japanese: ゴン＝フリークス, Hepburn: Gon Furīkusu) is the main protagonist of the series and an athletic, naïve, and friendly boy. Having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he gets along very well with animals and has superhuman senses such as heightened sense of smell and sight, as well as very keen taste. Raised by Mito, Gon wants to become a Hunter in order to find his father, Ging, who is one. During the Hunter Exam Gon befriends Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight. After successfully becoming a licensed Hunter, Gon and Killua learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger.[ch. 47, 48, 137] After his trio becomes the first people to beat Greed Island and helping to stop the Chimera Ants, Gon meets his father.[ch. 335]His flaws lie in his impulsive nature and stubbornness. Gon sometimes fails to think things through and such actions lead to him suffering. Though possessing talent far beyond the norm for his age, anytime his abilities are challenged he feels as if he has to prove his antagonist wrong. He continually strives to obtain greater power, often becoming exceptionally stronger in his anger. But Gon's anger also leads to extremely reckless tendencies. When his emotions are ignited, Gon becomes irrational and completely oblivious to anything else. Gon's Nen type is Enhancement, which gives him his great strength and recuperative abilities.[ch. 60] His Hatsu or specific use of Nen is called Ja Jan Ken (ジャジャン拳) a play on "Janken," the Japanese word for rock-paper-scissors.[ch. 207] When Gon throws out "Rock" it is an enhanced punch, "Scissors" transmutes a sword from his index and middle fingers for mid-ranged attacks, and "Paper" emits a ball of aura for long-ranged attacks.[ch. 145, 193, 209] During his fight with Neferpitou, it appears that Gon entered into a Nen Contract in order to have "all the power [he]'ll ever have" and grew to an older age.[ch. 305, 306, 324] After returning to normal thanks to Alluka Zoldyck's ability, Gon has lost the ability to use Nen.[ch. 333, 334, 345] Gon is a popular character with fans, coming in third place in the series' first two popularity polls.


=== Killua Zoldyck ===
Voiced by: Kanako Mitsuhashi (1999 series, Japanese), Annika Odegard (1999 series, English), Mariya Ise (2011 series, Japanese), Cristina Vee (2011 series, English)Killua Zoldyck (キルア＝ゾルディック, Kirua Zorudikku) is initially introduced as a cheeky, cheerful kid full of mischievous ideas who befriends Gon during the Hunter Exam. However, his ruthlessness and aptitude in killing shows the other side of him — deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. A member of the famous Zoldyck Family of assassins, Killua has been trained to be an assassin since birth and conditioned to possess extreme tolerance for poison, electricity and pain. Although Killua fails during his first Hunter Exam by killing an opponent, suspected to be due to his elder brother Illumi's influence, he attends the exam again the following year, earning his license by eliminating all other applicants in the very first trial.[ch. 36, 37, 148] Killua and Gon learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger.[ch. 47, 48, 137] He becomes one of the first people to beat Greed Island, helps stop the Chimera Ants, and uses his sibling Alluka's special abilities to heal the nearly-dead Gon.
Conflicting with Killua's predisposition to kill is his unyielding loyalty to his new friends. Killua puts them before himself without being concerned about his own health or even his life and without a single complaint. Previously, Killua's greatest flaw was his fear of those seemingly more powerful than him.[ch. 210] Killua had been trained as an assassin by Illumi to be extremely cautious and only engage in combat if victory is absolutely certain. Showing great promise from birth, he possesses extraordinary agility and strength that makes Killua a one-man killing machine. Killua has already mastered many killing techniques at a tender age and is set to be one of the best assassins his family has ever produced. His Nen type is Transmutation, which allows him to change the properties of his aura into electricity.[ch. 60, 122] His Hatsu involves various uses of electricity to increase his physical capabilities, such as Godspeed (神速（カンムル）, Kanmuru), which allows him to move at immeasurable speeds.[ch. 281] Killua is a popular character with fans, coming in first place in the series' first two popularity polls.


=== Kurapika ===
Voiced by: Noriko Hidaka (1998 film), Yuki Kaida (1999 series, Japanese), Cheryl McMaster (1999 series, English), Miyuki Sawashiro (2011 series, Japanese), Erika Harlacher (2011 series, English)Kurapika (クラピカ) is the sole survivor of the Kurta (クルタ, Kuruta) clan, a race with treasured irises that turn scarlet in times of anger or emotional agitation.[ch. 7] Four years before the series, the entire Kurta clan was eradicated by a band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe.[ch. 2] The Troupe desecrated the bodies of his race by stealing their scarlet eyes following the genocide, thereafter selling them on the black market. He participates in the Hunter Exam alongside Gon, Leorio and Killua in order to become a Blacklist Hunter and gain the resources to take vengeance for his race and retrieve their eyes.[ch. 2, 7] Despite being a moralist, Kurapika is not above adjoining himself to society's underworld in order to accomplish his own desires — aligning himself with the Nostrade mafia family as soon as the opportunity presents itself. After becoming a licensed Hunter, he soon becomes head of Nostrade's bodyguards.[ch. 79] Normally intelligent, quick-thinking and levelheaded, when Kurapika sees a spider, the symbol of the Phantom Troupe, he becomes enraged.[ch. 18] He kills Uvogin, causes Pakunoda's death, and seals Chrollo Lucilfer's Nen. He is later invited to join the Zodiacs as the "Rat" at Leorio's recommendation and only accepts upon being told that Tserriednich Hui Guo Rou has the last batch of scarlet eyes that he needs to retrieve.[ch. 344, 345] This leads to his accompanying Woble Hui Guo Rou to the Dark Continent as her bodyguard.
Kurapika's Nen type is Conjuration, however, when his eyes turn scarlet, he becomes a Specialist.[ch. 83] He conjures a unique weapon — five chains, one extending from each finger on his right hand. His ring finger, Dowsing Chain: The Guiding Ring Finger (導く薬指の鎖（ダウジングチェーン）, Daujingu Chēn), has a ball on the end used for dowsing and normal defensive and offensive purposes.[ch. 68] Kurapika entered into a Nen contract for the chain on his middle finger, Chain Jail: The Restraining Middle Finger (束縛する中指の鎖（チェーンジェイル）, Chēn Jeiru); in order to have an unbreakable chain that will hold members of the Phantom Troupe no matter what, he offered his life should he use it on anyone other than its members.[ch. 83] His thumb chain, Holy Chain: Healing Thumb (癒す親指の鎖（ホーリーチェーン）, Hōrī Chēn), heals any injury with the crucifix on the end.[ch. 84] His little finger, Judgement Chain: Arbiter Little Finger (律する小指の鎖（ジャッジメントチェーン）, Jajjimento Chēn), stabs an enemy's heart with the little blade on the end while Kurapika sets a rule, if the enemy violates that rule they die.[ch. 84] His index finger, Thieving Index Finger: Steal Chain (奪う人差し指の鎖（スチールチェーン）, Suchīru Chēn), uses the syringe on the end to extract someone's aura and Nen ability.[ch. 361] His specialist ability, Emperor Time: Absolute Mastery (絶対時間（エンペラータイム）, Enperā Taimu), allows him to utilize 100% of all types of Nen, however, it shortens his lifespan by one hour every second he is using it.[ch. 83, 364] When he uses his index finger with Emperor Time activated, it turns into Stealth Dolphin: Index Finger in Emperor Time (人指し指の"絶対時間"（ステルスドルフィン）, Suterusu Dorufin), a dolphin-like figure only he can see that allows him to use the stolen ability and informs him on its basic details.[ch. 361] If Kurapika then stabs someone else with his index finger, the ability to use the stolen ability is transferred to them and they can both see Stealth Dolphin.[ch. 364] Kurapika was inspired by the Ohmu in Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Kurapika is a popular character with fans, coming in second place in the series' first two popularity polls.

After losing a friend to a curable illness he could not afford the treatment for, Leorio dedicates himself to becoming a Hunter in order to pay for the costs of medical school, so he can become a doctor and treat the impoverished for free.[ch. 7] Though he is often outshone by the genius combat abilities of Gon and Killua, compared to the average man, Leorio is indeed talented. After becoming a licensed Hunter, Leorio assists his friends in their encounters with the Phantom Troupe from the sidelines. He reappears while Gon is hospitalized and enters the running to become the next Chairman of the Hunter Association, although he loses.[ch. 335] Leorio is later invited to become a member of the Zodiacs as the "Boar" and joins their expedition to the Dark Continent.[ch. 343] When the Black Whale finally sets sail, Leorio starts working at the medical care facility on the third deck under Cheadle Yorkshire. Killua suspects that Leorio's Nen type is Emission after seeing him teleport a punch across a room and out of a wormhole.[ch. 325, 326] Leorio is a popular character with fans, coming in fifth and sixth place in the series' first two popularity polls.

In the manga, his sentences typically end with a suit symbol. Hisoka takes an interest in Gon and his friends after encountering them during the Hunter Exam, letting them live so that they grow into more worthy opponents.[ch. 28] Although he is initially positioned as an antagonist due to his affinity towards murder, he later acts as a comrade to Gon when it suits his own interests. Hisoka is revealed to be member number four of the Phantom Troupe, although he only joined in order to get a chance to fight their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer.[ch. 78] He leaves the group when Chrollo's Nen is sealed by Kurapika and sets out to find a way to break the seal.[ch. 119] Having been successful in this task, Hisoka dies after fighting Chrollo in Heavens Arena, but revives himself, and goes on a killing rampage against the Phantom Troupe.[ch. 357] Hisoka is currently believed to be onboard the Black Whale, where he is being hunted by the Phantom Troupe and the Xi-Yu and Cha-R mafia families.[ch. 378]Hisoka's Nen type is Transmutation, allowing him to change the type or properties of his aura. He most often uses Elastic Love - Bungee Gum (伸縮自在の愛（バンジーガム）, Banjī Gamu), which makes his aura elastic and sticky similar to chewing gum.[ch. 55] He also uses Flimsy Lies - Texture Surprise (薄っぺらな嘘（ドッキリテクスチャー）, Dokkiri Tekusuchā), which allows him to reproduce the texture of his choice on any flat surface; such as making a handkerchief appear to be skin.[ch. 55] Hisoka is a popular character with fans, coming in fourth and fifth place in the series' first two popularity polls.

Chrollo led the genocide of the Kurta Clan, resulting in him being targeted by Kurapika who punishes him by both neutralizing his Nen and forcing him to make no contact with his subordinates.[ch. 117] But Hisoka aids in acquiring an exorcist to remove Kurapika's seal so he can fight Chrollo and is killed. Chrollo then boards the Black Whale.[ch. 366] His Nen type is Specialization and his ability Skill Hunter: Bandit's Secret (盗賊の極意（スキルハンター）, Sukiru Hantā) allows him to directly steal and use the abilities of other Nen users, which he stores in a Conjured book.[ch. 98] Chrollo came in fourth place in the series' second popularity poll.

Voiced by: Chō (Japanese), Doug Erholtz (English)Bonolenov Ndongo (ボノレノフ＝ンドンゴ, Bonorenofu Ndongo) is covered in bandages and wears boxing gloves, and bears the number 10 in the Troupe. These bandages cover up a large number of holes throughout his body. During the Chimera Ant arc, he was seen fighting with the other members of the Phantom Troupe against the Chimera Ants. His physical power ranks eighth among the Troupe. Bonolenov is a descendant of the Gyudondond (ギュドンドンド), a small wild tribe that was chased out of their lands by development. When males of the Gyudondond tribe reach the age of three, they are circumcised and needles are inserted in various parts of their body. Over time, these needles are replaced with thicker and thicker sticks, and the holes are stabilized with bamboo stalks or stones. Using these holes, Gyudondond males are able to create a variety of sounds with the air flowing through. They are called "Bap" (バプ), the dancing warriors, and fulfill the role of shamans and performers in their tribe. Before combat, they use their bodies to play songs of battle. The Gyudondond believe that the more beautiful a sound that is played, the greater the spirit it can summon.

He is attired in what one would expect from a bandit—dark clothes partnered with a skullhead scarf that covers his mouth. He seldom speaks, but when he does, it is full of grammatical errors, giving the impression that he is not speaking in his native tongue. During the Phantom Troupe's fight with Chimera Ants, Feitan reverts to his native language, which is shown with Chinese characters. After Feitan's victory over Zazan in Meteor City, he is crowned temporary leader of the Phantom Troupe. Feitan's movements are incredibly fast, being able to leave afterimages of his body. He wields an umbrella that conceals both a sword and a gun that fires out of the tip. Following Chrollo's return, Feitan seems to have abandoned his position as interim leader of the Phantom Troupe. He later appears on the Black Whale with Phinks, Franklin, and Nobunaga.
His Nen type is Transmutation. His ability Unforgiven: Pain Packer (許されざる者（ペインパッカー）, Pein Pakkā) transforms the injuries he has received from his enemy into an attack. The more pain he receives, the stronger his attack is. Currently, only Burnt by the Sun: Rising Sun (太陽に灼かれて（ライジングサン）, Raijingu San) has been revealed, a miniature sun that burns anyone around him disregarding even allies, as shown by the rest of the Phantom Troupe fleeing from the scene when he uses this ability. Only Feitan is unaffected by the attack, presumably because of the armor that is formed on him.[ch. 229] Feitan came in tenth place in the series' second popularity poll.

He is the weakest in the Troupe in terms of raw physical power. In fact, his Conjuration Nen abilities so far suggest that he is not involved in combat at all, but rather theft and subterfuge. His Nen ability is called Gallery Fake: Divine Left Hand, Demonic Right Hand (神の左手悪魔の右手（ギャラリーフェイク）, Gyararī Feiku), which allows him to make perfect copies of any object by touching it with his left hand and producing the copy with his right.

Her ability Nen Stitches (念糸縫合（ネンシほうごう）, Nenshi Hōgō) forms her aura into thread, the strength of which is inversely proportional to its length: a thread as long as the diameter of the Earth would be as strong as cotton, but a one millimeter-long thread can lift a ton.

Nobunaga specializes in combining nen with the use of his katana in executing enemies. His best friend is Uvogin, and the two bring out the best of each other during combat. Seeing some of Uvogin's personality in Gon, he expresses interest in having Gon join the Troupe, though Gon adamantly refuses. Nobunaga ranks ninth in physical power among the Troupe, and is one of the original members from Meteor City. Nobunaga is on the Black Whale with the rest of the Troupe, hunting for treasure and Hisoka.

Pakunoda's Nen type is Specialization. Her main ability is to read the memories of people she touches by asking specific questions, Psychometry.[ch. 103] Her secondary ability, Memory Bomb (記憶弾（メモリーボム）, Memorī Bomu), allows her to conjure these memories into the shape of a bullet which she fires into people's heads from a gun, thereby giving them that information.

Phinks, along with Feitan, Franklin, and Nobunaga, confront and thrash three unruly passengers. His Nen ability is called Kaiten - Ripper Cyclotron (廻天（リッパー・サイクロトロン）, Rippā Saikurotoron), the strength of which is dependent upon how many times he rotates his arm; the more rotations, the more powerful his attack will be.

Voiced by: Yasuhiro Takato (1999 series, Japanese), Jordan Schartner (1999 series, English), Noriko Hidaka (2011 series, Japanese), Griffin Burns (2011 series, English)Shalnark (シャルナーク, Sharunāku) is member number six of the Phantom Troupe, and from his appearance, he seems to be a normal boy. However, he is one of the most intelligent and quick-thinking members in the group, being highly adept at using computers and information gathering. Shalnark is also a licensed Hunter, so he has access to certain information that could be potentially useful to the Phantom Troupe. He ranks tenth in physical power among the Troupe. Shalnark is the second member killed by Hisoka after he decides to wipe out the entire Phantom Troupe following his defeat by Chrollo.[ch. 357] Shalnark's Nen type is Manipulation.
His main ability, Black Voice: Mobile Fate Director (携帯する他人の運命（ブラックボイス）, Burakku Boisu), allows him to completely control the actions of others remotely using his cell phone after sticking a specialized antenna into their bodies. His secondary ability involves applying the antenna upon himself and putting his body on autopilot, resulting in an enhanced state with enough power to devastate most opponents. However, he dislikes this ability because he is subject to immense muscle pain for several days after its use, and as he has no control over the process and retains no memory over what has transpired he can not derive any pleasure or satisfaction when he uses it to win a fight.[ch. 227] Shalnark came in 17th place in the series' second popularity poll.

Out of all of the Phantom Troupe, he is the strongest in terms of raw physical power. Uvogin is so strong, that direct hits from bullets, sniper bullets, and even anti-tank rockets do not cause visible damage to him.[ch. 75] Like all of the Troupe, he never hesitates to kill, and particularly enjoys combat against skilled opponents. Although he prefers to fight alone, Uvogin becomes stronger when fighting with a partner, usually Nobunaga, because he fights better when there is someone else to protect (although he never admits this).[ch. 93] Seeking revenge on Kurapika for capturing him after his battle with the Shadow Beasts, Uvogin tracks him to the hotel where Neon Nostrade and the rest of her bodyguards are staying. They fight one-on-one in a small canyon on the outskirts of Yorknew City. Kurapika eventually captures Uvogin with his Chain Jail, and questions him about the location and abilities of the other Phantom Troupe members. Uvogin refuses to answer any questions, responding only to kill him. Kurapika then pierces Uvogin's chest with his Judgement Chain ability, giving Uvogin the condition that he must answer all questions truthfully. But Uvogin refuses to answer Kurapika's question on the whereabouts of the other Troupe members, instantly killed with his body buried by Kurapika soon after.[ch. 84] He is the 11th member of the Troupe and his Nen type is Enhancement.

=== Chimera Ants ===
Chimera Ants (キメラ＝アント, Kimera Anto) are a species of insect, extremely dangerous and ranked first among those that should be quarantined in the Hunter × Hunter universe.[ch. 187] They have voracious appetites and can consume several times their own weight within a single day. Chimera Ant queens possess an entirely unique method of reproduction known as Phagogenesis (摂食交配, Sesshoku Kōhai): reproducing asexually while imbuing her offspring with the genetic traits of whatever she ate.[ch. 187] To take advantage of the genes of a particular species, a Chimera Ant queen has been known to feed until the fodder species is driven to extinction. One mutated Chimera Ant Queen in particular targets humans, leading to the creation of humanoid Chimera Ants who desire individualism and develop the ability to use Nen.[ch. 188] These human Chimera Ants also possess the genetic memories of their "past lives," some only having trace memories while others are their original selves reborn.[ch. 215] Following the death of the Queen, the colony disburses with a majority following the King Meruem while others attempt to create their own colonies.[ch. 214] Only a few of the humanoid Chimera Ants survive and are allowed to live among humans, classified as a new species of magical beast.[ch. 315]


==== Chimera Ant Queen ====
Voiced by: Masako Ikeda (Japanese), Cindy Robinson (English)The Chimera Ant Queen (女王, Joō) is the first chimera ant to be seen in the series, having mysteriously mutated to about two meters tall instead of their typical height of ten centimeters.[ch. 187] She first appears having washed up injured on the shores of the autonomous region of Neo-Green Life (or simply NGL), a small insular nation located on an island known as the Mitene Union.[ch. 188] Driven by her reproductive instincts to give birth to a Chimera Ant King with ideal traits, the Queen immediately begins to feed on small mammals and aquatic life in order to give birth to soldier ants to bring her larger prey in greater amounts. When one brings her two human children to feed on, she notes them to be more nourishing then previous prey and becomes obsessed, sending her soldiers to concentrate on gathering more humans to feed on.[ch. 187] NGL's status as neo-Luddite enables the Queen's offspring to be unopposed before their activities are eventually learned by the outside world. The Queen is fatally injured when the Chimera Ant King forces his own premature birth, damaging her organs with massive blood loss.[ch. 213] Despite receiving treatment from Hunters, she dies while naming her son Meruem. But upon her death, the Queen is revealed to have birthed a twin sister to Meruem, who is later revealed to be Kite reborn as a Chimera Ant.[ch. 215, 316]


==== Meruem ====
Voiced by: Kōki Uchiyama (Japanese), Max Mittelman (English)Meruem (メルエム, Meruemu, alternatley "Meryem"[ch. 215]) is the Chimera Ant King (王, Ō) and the most powerful of the Queen's offspring. Forcing himself out the womb at the cost of the Queen's life, Meruem is arrogant with little sense of identity aside from his supposed destiny and preconceived notions of his kind's superiority over humans.[ch. 213] Meruem leaves N.G.L. with his Royal Guards in search of a place to establish his colony, taking over the Republic of East Gorteau. Pitou uses the corpse of its dictator Ming Jol-ik to order a mandatory gathering of the entire population for a national rally, so they can secretly sort to find Nen users who will be used as food.[ch. 223] They will also use Pitou's ability to manipulate the people, forming an army of soldiers under their control.[ch. 230] The Hunter Association mobilizes an extermination team to infiltrate the East Gorteau palace and assassinate Meruem, composed of a selected team of professional Hunters.
Meruem takes an interest in strategy games, defeating champion-level players by learning their battle tactics after disrupting the flow of their playing style.[ch. 244] However, he is unable to overcome the skill of a seemingly dimwitted blind girl named Komugi in Gungi, the local game she reigns over. As Meruem finds himself unable to beat her, he starts to show respect and care for Komugi while questioning his own violent methods as a way to rule.[ch. 255, 258] As such, the King wavers between his human emotions and animal instincts, ultimately deciding to compromise by taking over the planet for the Chimera Ants, but sparing humans and leaving them to live in reservations.[ch. 288, 297] Meruem's faltering leaves him vulnerable, experiencing fear for the first time when Netero detonates the bomb in his body as a last resort.[ch. 298] Near death, Meruem survives and regenerates by feeding on the cells of Pouf and Youpi, acquiring their abilities as well.[ch. 299, 312] The King suffers temporary memory loss before recovering his memories of Komugi.[ch. 301] However, Netero's suicide attack ultimately takes Meruem's life due to the poison the bomb leaves behind; he spends his final moments playing with Komugi before dying in her arms.[ch. 318]

Voiced by: Ayumi Fujimura (Japanese), Sarah Anne Williams (English)Neferpitou (ネフェルピトー, Neferupitō), also known as "Pitou" (ピトー), is a cat-humanoid Chimera Ant and the firstborn of the Royal Guards. Androgynous in appearance, he is one of the first Chimera Ants to fully utilize Nen with enough skill to be recognized by even Netero as a superior combatant.[ch. 201] Pitou shows a knack for medical/surgical procedures, first seen when he prods Pokkle's brain in order to have the human divulge everything he knows about Nen to the Ants.[ch. 198] A Specialist-type of Nen user,[ch. 198] his ability Toy Repair: Doctor Blythe (玩具修理者（ドクターブライス）, Dokutā Buraisu) heals injuries,[ch. 265] while Puppet Master's Serenity: Terpsichora (黒子舞想（テレプシコーラ）, Terepushikōra) allows him to manipulate the body or corpse of others like he does with Kite.[ch. 304] Realizing the potential threat Gon could pose to Meruem, Pitou plays on the boy's hopes to get him away from Komugi so he can kill him without endangering the girl.[ch. 295] But upon revealing Kite's fate, Pitou is brutally killed by Gon as a result of the boy forcibly aging himself at the cost of his ability to use Nen.[ch. 306] Despite his head being completely destroyed, Pitou's corpse is briefly reanimated by a more potent Terpsichora for the purpose of killing Gon, and servers the boy's arm before being damaged beyond repair.[ch. 307]

Having wholeheartedly devoted himself to protect Meruem while seeing humans as inferior, Pouf is grossly disturbed by the King's obsession with Komugi whom he views as a threat to their plans to the point of making attempts on the girl's life.[ch. 301] Pouf's Nen ability Bufferfly Scales Love Spring: Spiritual Message (鱗粉乃愛泉（スピリチュアルメッセージ）, Supirichuaru Messēji) spreads scales from his wings into the air allowing him to read opponents' psychological state.[ch. 273] When inhaled the scales have a hypnotic effect on the human populace, keeping them in place to be sorted at the palace.[ch. 260] His other ability Beelzebub, King of Flies (蠅の王（ベルゼブブ）, Beruzebubu) allows Pouf to break up his body into clones of various sizes down to nanosize.[ch. 286] Following the blast from Netero's bomb, Pouf runs to Meruem and allows him to feed on his own cells to save the King's life.[ch. 299] Pouf dies from the poison he was exposed to at ground zero of the bomb.[ch. 314]

Meleoron's Nen ability God's Alibi: Perfect Plan (神の不在証明（パーフェクトプラン）, Pāfekuto Puran) renders himself invisible and undetectable by smell, sound or even touch as long as he holds his breath.[ch. 242] His other ability, God's Accomplice (神の共犯者（かみのきょうはんしゃ）, Kami no Kyōhan-sha) allows him to use Perfect Plan on anyone he is touching.[ch. 243]

His Nen ability is Egg on Your Face: Missile Man (卵男（ミサイルマン）, Misairu Man) which conjures a back-mounted organism armed with missiles that implant centipedes that grow in size while feeding on the victim's defiance.[ch. 296] Using it for negotiation purposes, Welfin establishes an order or question for his target, if they refuse to obey or tell a lie the missiles attack.[ch. 276] Fear when confronted by Meruem causes Welfin to grow old in an instant, and he is only saved by uttering Komugi's name, causing the King to remember her and look for her instead.[ch. 313] After the battle, Welfin joins Hina and Bizef in seeking out Gyro in Meteor City.[ch. 315]

After the Queen's death, Cheetu leaves NGL and heads to the east before being impeded by Morel and Knuckle. Although he is tagged with Knuckle's A.P.R., Cheetu flees out of range, halting the interest-accruing.[ch. 221] The ordeal convinces Cheetu that he needs something other than pure speed and has A.P.R. exorcized by Hirin before getting a new Nen ability.[ch. 245] He confronts Morel again, with the new ability transporting them to a limited-sized area for a game of tag, but is defeated by being psychologically tricked.[ch. 247] Cheetu quickly develops another new Nen ability on the spot, a combined crossbow and claws, but is again tricked before fleeing.[ch. 248] He is later seen boasting about yet another new ability, but is crushed to death by Silva Zoldyck from above.[ch. 278]

=== Examiners ===
The Hunter Exam is divided into several stages, each one overseen by an experienced hunter. In the first shown exam in the series, the first examiner is Satotz (サトツ, Satotsu), who tests the candidates' stamina by leading them on a marathon of unknown length through a tunnel and a swampland filled with uniquely dangerous creatures.[ch. 6, 8] The second stage of the exam is administered by two Gourmet Hunters, Buhara (ブハラ) and Menchi (メンチ).

Chairman Netero organizes the final stage as a one-on-one fighting tournament, where the winner must get his opponent to admit defeat. In a twist, contestants pass the exam after winning only one fight with the loser advancing to the next round, meaning only one examinee will fail.[ch. 33] Satotz came in seventh and 22nd place in the series' first two popularity polls.

In order to do this, he uses methods like spiking drinks with a strong laxative and being contradictory simply to delay progress in a time-sensitive arena, where he is teamed up with them.[ch. 5, 16] He also attends the following Hunter Exam, where he, along with everyone else, is defeated by Killua.[ch. 148]

He was also injured during Killua's escape.[ch. 36] Milluki is in charge of torturing Killua as punishment, but does not have the drive to carry it out very long as he becomes physically exhausted.[ch. 42] After being tipped off by Killua on the whereabouts of a Greed Island cartridge, Milluki's excitement results in one of the rarer moments in which he makes an outside expedition in search of the game, he himself states that he had not left the mansion in eight years.

Fearing that Killua will ask Alluka's help to save Gon's life, Illumi asks for Hisoka's help in searching for and killing Alluka, as Alluka poses a grave danger to the entire Zoldyck family in the case of Killua getting killed by Alluka's power.[ch. 323] Killua eventually has Alluka cure Gon without consequence, this is because Killua can make demands of Nanika without paying a price.[ch. 333, 336] After Gon is healed, Killua demands Nanika not grant anyone else's wishes and starts traveling together with Alluka.[ch. 336, 338] The caption to a standalone illustration of Alluka in Volume 33 of Hunter × Hunter reads "Ai. I'm from the Dark Continent.," possibly suggesting that Alluka's power is due to the Gaseous Life-form: Ai (アイ) that humans brought back from the Dark Continent.[ch. 341]

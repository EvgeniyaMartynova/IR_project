John Galvin (Irish politician)

John Galvin (15 May 1907 – 11 October 1963) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork Borough constituency at the August 1956 by-election caused by the death of Patrick McGrath of Fianna Fáil. He was re-elected at the 1957 and 1961 general elections. He died in office in 1963, and the February 1964 by-election held for his seat was won by his widow Sheila Galvin.

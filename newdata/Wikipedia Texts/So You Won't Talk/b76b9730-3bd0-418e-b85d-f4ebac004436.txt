== Reception ==
The Film Daily only rated the film as "fair", observing "The situations are generally amusing, but they lack the zip and power which spells concerted comedy and occasional belly-laughs." The magazine faulted the script mostly, saying that Sedgwick's "... direction keeps matters moving as best he can considering that the script and gags are none too strong or original." The felt that Brown's fans would appreciate his performance, as it was what they would expect, particularly pointing out the solid performance of Robinson. Motion Picture Daily was kinder to the film, calling it the funniest film Brown had made since Elmer, the Great. They felt the picture had "considerable hilarity", and complimented the direction of Sedgwick, as well as the work of the supporting cast. The Motion Picture Herald also enjoyed the picture, again calling the film the best in Brown's career since Elmer, the Great. They also felt that direction of Sedgewick, the production of Sparks, and the screenplay by Flournoy were all done well.

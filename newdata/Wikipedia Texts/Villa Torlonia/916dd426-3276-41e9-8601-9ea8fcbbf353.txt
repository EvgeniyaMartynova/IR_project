San Mauro Pascoli

San Mauro Pascoli (Romagnol: San Mevar) is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Forlì-Cesena in the Italian region Emilia-Romagna, located about 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of Bologna and about 35 kilometres (22 mi) southeast of Forlì. It is at some 7.5 kilometres (4.7 mi) from the sea, the frazione of San Mauro Mare facing it.
The comune was called San Mauro di Romagna until 1932, when its name was changed in honor of the poet Giovanni Pascoli and his beloved sister Maria, who were born here. Famous Italian shoe designer Giuseppe Zanotti was also born there.

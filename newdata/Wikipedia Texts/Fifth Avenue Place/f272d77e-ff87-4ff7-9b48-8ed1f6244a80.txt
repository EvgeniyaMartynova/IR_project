Fifth Avenue Place (Calgary)

Fifth Avenue Place is a high-rise skyscraper complex in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It was originally called Esso Plaza and Imperial Oil is still the anchor tenant of the building. It occupies the entire area of a city block, between 4th and 5th Avenue South and 1st and 2nd Street West in Downtown Calgary.
The buildings are managed by Brookfield Properties.


== Towers ==

The complex consists of two structures, East Tower and West Tower, both with 35 floors and a height of 133 m (436 ft). Construction started in 1979 and the complex was completed in 1981, at the height of the 1980s oil boom. Although the towers are almost identical, they are arranged in an "L" shape, with the West Tower oriented east-west, and the East Tower places on a north-south direction. Fifth Avenue Place was built in late modernist style and has curtain walls with alternating vision glass on all sides. The three level underground parkade provides 793 parking stalls.  The two towers are connected by a two level shopping galleria, which is connected by the Plus 15 skywalk network to nearby structures. A recreation area on the north side contains a large reflecting pool with three fountains.

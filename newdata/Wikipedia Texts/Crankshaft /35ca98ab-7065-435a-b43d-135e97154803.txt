== Playing career ==
From 1999–2000 to 2002–03, he played for Cornell University. While at Cornell, he served as captain his senior year and was twice named a first team All-American. He was nominated to the Hobey Baker Memorial Award Final Ten in 2003. In the 2003–04 and the locked-out 2004–05 season he played for San Jose's minor league affiliate, the Cleveland Barons, and contributed both offensively and defensively, leading the team in plus/minus and being second on the team in points for a defenseman. He also served as an alternate captain. He was awarded the Cleveland Barons Rubbermaid "Player of the Year" (along with Josh Gorges) in 2005.

During the 2005–06 NHL season, he was called up to San Jose, due to various injuries plaguing the team's defense. In his short time there that season, he gained praise for his physical presence, as well as solid defense, from such San Jose organization members as TV color commentator Drew Remenda.
Murray renewed his contract with the Sharks in June 2006, signing a three-year-deal worth US$1.65 million. Part of that deal was a $150,000 signing bonus.  In late September 2008, he agreed to a four-year contract extension with the Sharks supposedly worth US$10 million.His first NHL goal was scored in his 115th career game on February 21, 2008, against Martin Biron of the Philadelphia Flyers.
In the pre-season game of September 26, 2009, Murray performed a hat trick, scoring 3 even strength goals against the Anaheim Ducks, leading to the 6–0 shutout victory, though it was unofficial due to it being in the pre-season. If it had been in the regular season, it would have been his first and only career NHL hat trick.
In 2010, he was chosen as the 16th-smartest athlete in sports by  Sporting News.On March 25, 2013, the Sharks traded Murray to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Pittsburgh's second round pick in the 2013 draft and a conditional second round pick in 2014. The Sharks later received the conditional pick due to Pittsburgh's progression through two rounds in the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs.On August 22, 2013, Murray signed as a free agent to a one-year contract worth $1.5 million with the Montreal Canadiens.He was not re-signed by the Canadiens at the end of his contract and unable to attract NHL interest, signed a one-year deal with Kölner Haie of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga on January 20, 2015. In the 2014–15 season, Murray was limited to just 8 appearances with the Kölner Haie before suffering injury. On March 13, 2015, Murray returned to North America and signed a professional try-out contract to practice with the Calgary Flames.Murray announced his retirement in October 21, 2016.

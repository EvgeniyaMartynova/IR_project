Cardiff Bay railway station

Cardiff Bay railway station (Welsh: Bae Caerdydd), formerly Cardiff Bute Road, is a station serving the Cardiff Bay and Butetown areas of Cardiff, Wales. It is the southern terminus of the Butetown Branch Line 1 mile (1.5 km) south of Cardiff Queen Street.
Only one platform is now in use. The station building lies on Bute Street, although the rest of the station remains visible from the nearby Lloyd George Avenue. For various reasons, including it being the origin of the first steam-powered passenger train service in Wales, the station is a Grade II* listed building.The station is within walking distance of the Senedd and the Wales Millennium Centre
Passenger services are provided by Transport for Wales. The station is due to close by December 2023, when the new Cardiff Bay station opens.


== History ==
The line to the docks was opened on 9 October 1840 but the station was not mentioned in Bradshaw's railway timetables until December 1844.  It was opened as "Cardiff Bute Dock" but the name was changed to "Cardiff Docks" in 1845 by the Taff Vale Railway (engineer: Isambard Kingdom Brunel). The station building was the head office of the TVR until 1862. After this it also housed the consulates of the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Brazil, with separate flag poles provided for each nation.
It was renamed "Cardiff Bute Road" by the Great Western Railway on 1 July 1924 and given its present name in 1994.


=== Renovation of station building ===


==== Use as a railway museum ====

The building was restored in the 1980s and served for a time as a railway museum under the auspices of the National Museums and Galleries of Wales and the Butetown Historical Railway Society (which in 1997 relocated its activities to the Vale of Glamorgan Railway). Following this, the station building had become derelict with train passengers now using a temporary shelter.


==== Residential and commercial property ====

In August 2017, plans to build an office and apartment block next to a Grade II-listed former railway station in Cardiff were approved. These included renovating and converting the derelict building and link it to a new four-storey building. The new building would house 10 flats, offices and a cafe. The Victorian Society said the Bute Street station was one of the oldest and most significant railway structures in Wales and last year appeared on its list of the 10 most endangered buildings. It said it supported a sensitive restoration scheme but the current proposal would cause a "high degree of harm to the building and its setting". The first stage of the development opened in June 2019.


== Services ==

There is a shuttle service between Cardiff Queen Street and Cardiff Bay every 12 minutes Monday to Saturdays (between 0630 and 2330) and every 12 minutes on Sundays (between 1100 and 1630) using a Class 153 "Super Sprinter". The service was formerly operated by a Class 121 "bubble car", but this was withdrawn in June 2013.


== Proposed new station ==

In June 2018, the new Welsh train operating company Transport for Wales Rail Services announced plans to build a line extension and a terminus station, The Flourish (since renamed back to Cardiff Bay) for the Butetown Branch, along with an intermediate station at Loudoun Square. This station, will completely replace the existing station, which will close.

Cardiff railway station, New South Wales

Cardiff railway station is located on the Main Northern line in New South Wales, Australia. It serves the western Newcastle suburb of Cardiff, opening on 14 March 1889, relocating to its present site on 8 June 1902.Despite being one of the busiest stations in the region, the station long had substandard facilities, in particular, a lack of disabled access. There had been numerous (often contradictory) proposals to either upgrade Cardiff or relocate the station to the abandoned station at nearby Glendale, following community pressure stretching back to the 1990s.In November 2010, work started on a series of upgrades. These improved the parking and stairs and provided wheelchair access, weather protection, and a lengthened platform capable of accommodating eight carriage trains.

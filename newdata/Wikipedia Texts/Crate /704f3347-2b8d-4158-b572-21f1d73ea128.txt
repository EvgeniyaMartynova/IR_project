== History ==
Following Iron Lore Entertainment's failure to secure funding for its next project, former members of Iron Lore announced they had created a new company on February 18, 2008. Several days later, the company announced it would be working as a contractor Demiurge Studios, providing art and design leadership on one of the company's projects.On August 19, 2008, Crate announced the acquisition of the Black Legion intellectual property that has been in development at Iron Lore before the studio closed. Iron Lore had attracted significant interest from publishers while pitching Black Legion in late 2007 but had not been able to survive long enough to close a publishing deal. Crate had hoped to pick up on the momentum that Black Legion had gained but due to the U.S. economic recession publishers opted to pass on a large project from the studio.On July 27, 2009, Crate announced that it acquired a license to use Iron Lore's Titan Quest game engine for their new action role-playing game project. On January 21, 2010 Crate announced that the name of their new project would be Grim Dawn.On April 18, 2012, Crate gave an update on the Grim Dawn Kickstarter page, where it revealed that the core of the company consists of only two full-time employees, with additional work being provided by former Iron Lore employees when needed.After the strong success of the Kickstarter campaign (where they received nearly double their funding target in pledges), Crate were able to hire additional staff, several of whom were former employees of the defunct 38 Studios. This allowed Crate to significantly increase the rate of development, and on May 15, 2013 the Grim Dawn alpha (Build 8) was released. On November 5, 2013 the game was released on Steam Early Access. In June 2015, Crate announced that they had hired Eric Sexton, former artist and designer at Blizzard North, stating that his role primarily involved world building and the development of lore.
Grim Dawn was released in February 25, 2016 and received high critical praise. On August 3, 2016, one of the Kickstarter goals - a survival mode - was released entitled "The Crucible" where players battle waves of foes across multiple arenas. An expansion for the game entitled "Ashes of Malmouth" was released on 11th October 2017 adding two more Acts to the game as well as two more masteries: Inquisitor and Necromancer. On March 5, 2018 Crate announced a second expansion for the game entitled "Forgotten Gods" which was released on March 27, 2019.In a live dev stream on Twitch on 19th April 2019 Crate announced that Forgotten Gods had sold over 100,000 copies and collectively between all of the DLCs and the base game Grim Dawn had sold over 3 million copies. https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/forthcoming-forgotten-gods-expac-what-we-know-so-far-part-ii/46489

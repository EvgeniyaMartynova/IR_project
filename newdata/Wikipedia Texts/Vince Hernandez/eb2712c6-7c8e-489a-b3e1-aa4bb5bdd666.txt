Aspen Comics

Aspen Comics is a California entertainment company founded in 2003 by artist Michael Turner. It has locations in Santa Monica and Marina Del Rey. The company is best known for producing comic books and figurines.


== History ==
The company was created by comic book artist Michael Turner in January 2003. The name "Aspen" comes from the main character in Turner's comic series, Fathom. Aspen Comics released the fantasy adventure Soulfire in 2004, its first ongoing series. 2005 marked the return of Fathom (originally published by Image Comics), with comic artist Koi Turnbull taking over the illustration of the title. Ekos, a collaboration between Turner and Geoff Johns was scheduled to follow shortly after Soulfire, but was still unreleased prior to Turner's death in 2008.
In 2001, Top Cow Productions announced a live-action Fathom feature film and supposedly entered into an agreement with James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment to co-produce the film.

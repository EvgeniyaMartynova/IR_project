He is a member of the council of the Keston Institute and holds an MBA from the Cass Business School.Udy has made a long-term study of the history of the gulag camps of Norilsk, his collection of photographs of which is in the Hoover Institution Archives. His book Labour and the Gulag (2017) examines the response of the British labour movement to conditions under Stalinism and developed from his earlier Gulag studies after he discovered that the British labour movement had suppressed criticism of conditions in the camps.

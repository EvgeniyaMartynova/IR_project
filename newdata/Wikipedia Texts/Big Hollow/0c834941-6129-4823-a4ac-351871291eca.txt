According to the district's website, the school district has been in operation since 1836.Around 1850 a 4th of an acre on the corner of what now is U.S. Route 12 and Illinois Route 134 in Ingleside near the village of Fox Lake was donated by Mr. William B. D for a school in the big geographical hollow. They put up a log cabin with the desks fastened to the wall, with the teachers desk in the middle of the room. The building was heated by a wood stove and had few books. Teachers were originally payed with meat and then would sell the meat to someone for money.Then in 1873 the building was replaced with a frame building and the district bought more land. on the new building there was a blackboard and a bench around the stove in the middle of the room to keep the kids warm.in 1917 the building was once again remolded with new windows, desks and stove.In the 1940s, a new Big Hollow School was built on the southeast corner of the intersection.

Haarlem, Western Cape

Haarlem is a settlement in Garden Route District Municipality in the Western Cape province of South Africa.
Village 16km east of Avontuur and 29 km south-east of Uniondale, in the Langkloof. Originally laid out in 1856, it was taken over by the Berlin Missionary Society in 1860. The mission station was named Anhalt-Schmidt, but the village had already been named Haarlem and bears that name today, presumably after the city of Haarlem 19km west of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

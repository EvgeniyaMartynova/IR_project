== Description ==
The size of the shell varies between 3.5 and 20 cm (1.4–7.9 in). "The large, much depressed shell has a rounded-oval shape. The distance of the apex from the margin is one-fifth the length of the shell. It is sculptured with fine spiral  cords cut by close minute striae of increment. It shows radiating waves or folds above. A slight angle at the row of perforations, below it is broadly excavated and then  carinated. The about six perforations are elevated and circular. The outline is suborbicular, much depressed  and solid but not thick. The surface is either dark red with few radiating angular white patches, or dull red and green, streaked and mottled. The spiral cords of the outer surface are either nearly equal, or have slightly larger ones at wide intervals. They are decussated by close growth-striae. The whorls number a trifle over 3. Inside they are corrugated like the outer surface, silvery, and very brilliantly iridescent. The reflections are  chiefly sea-green and red. The columellar plate is broad, flat, and obliquely truncated at its base. The cavity of the spire is wide, open, but shallow
This is a variable form, in color varying from dark coral red to dull red streaked with pale green."

Range is from Fremantle, Western Australia, to Angourie, New South Wales, and around Tasmania.It is called the blacklip abalone because the edge of the foot is black.

== Tsvangirai acceptance speech ==
In his acceptance speech Tsvangirai said:"Faced with a ruthless dictator, the temptation among the people is to look inwards, to take cover within our individual self and to insulate against collective action. That temptation can overwhelm you and promote fear. Fear is sign of weakness. Fear is a sin. With hope and courage, we must overcome fear. I feel I must record my unhappiness and sorrow at the news of a number of pensioners, the vulnerable and the weak that lost their lives because of lack of support. The dictatorship has demolished their coping mechanisms, their last lines of defence and thrown them off balance. Through propaganda and a pliant media, the people of Zimbabwe must exercise extreme care and caution. The regime wants you to give up."

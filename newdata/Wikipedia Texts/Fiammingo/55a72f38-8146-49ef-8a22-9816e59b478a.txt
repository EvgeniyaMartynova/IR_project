== Biography ==
Born in Maubege in 1602, Desubleo probably learned his trade in Flanders in the workshop of Abraham Janssens together with his stepbrother Nicolas Renier, with whom he moved to Rome in the first half of the 1620s. He was employed in Bologna around 1630 in the busy workshop of Guido Reni, who was a crucial influence on him and on other artists of his age or slightly younger, including Simone Cantarini and Boulanger. He worked for a long time in the Veneto region and there is evidence of his presence in 1665 in Parma, where the significant paintings he left include a large altarpiece with the Madonna and Saints for the Cathedral and a canvas on the secular subject of Sacred Love Triumphing over Profane Love. It was in Parma that he died in 1676.

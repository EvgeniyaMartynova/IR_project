Fairy tales are stories that range from those originating in folklore to more modern stories defined as literary fairy tales. Despite subtle differences in the categorizing of fairy tales, folklore, fables, myths, and legends, a modern definition of the fairy tale, as provided by Jens Tismar's monologue in German, is a story that differs "from an oral folk tale", written by "a single identifiable author", which can be characterised as "simple and anonymous", and exists in a mutable and difficult to define genre with a close relationship to folktales.

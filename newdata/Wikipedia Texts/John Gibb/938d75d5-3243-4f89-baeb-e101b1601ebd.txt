John Gibb Thom

Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Gibb Thom DSO MC (1 August 1891 – 19 February 1941) was a British soldier, judge and politician from Linlithgow.
Thom served with the Gordon Highlanders, and was awarded the Military Cross in 1917, and later that year received the Distinguished Service Order for "conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty".
He was elected as a Member of Parliament for Dunbartonshire in 1926, losing the 1929 election but returning to office in 1931, where he stayed until resigning a year later.
In 1937 he was knighted as part of the New Years Honours, and was also made Chief Justice of the High Court of Judicature in Allahabad, a position he held until his death in 1941, aged 49.

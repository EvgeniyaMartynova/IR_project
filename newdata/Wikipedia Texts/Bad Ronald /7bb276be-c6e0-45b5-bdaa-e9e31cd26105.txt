Bad Ronald (band)

Bad Ronald was a rap-rock band from New York City who released their self-titled debut album in 2001.  Their first single, "Let's Begin", was briefly on MTV's rotation and featured in the film Not Another Teen Movie.  Their second single, "1st Time", was featured in the 2002 movie Orange County.  The band achieved little success in spite of their promotion with MTV.  The group formed in 1999 after working shows in New York City.  The group wanted "to form a band that combined rap, pop, rock, and sophomoric humor."

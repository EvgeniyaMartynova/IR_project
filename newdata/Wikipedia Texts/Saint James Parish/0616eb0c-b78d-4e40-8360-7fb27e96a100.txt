St. James Parish, Cumberland

St James Parish, Cumberland is one of the 57 parishes of Cumberland County, New South Wales, a cadastral unit for use on land titles. It is one of the four small parishes in the Sydney city area, which is named after the Anglican church of St James, which was consecrated in 1824. The name St James is also used today for the railway station in the same area.
A record for a marriage, funeral or baptism ceremony held in the 'Parish of St James' refers to this geographical parish, not necessarily meaning the Anglican church of St James, and the church notes that this has been the case of some confusion. A marriage held at the catholic St Mary's Cathedral in the 19th century would be recorded as being in the Parish of St James.

Jones, founded the school in 1909. Helen was one of six surviving members of the band interviewed in the 1986 documentary film International Sweethearts of Rhythm.After the band dissolved in 1949, Jones moved to Omaha and worked as a licensed practical nurse at Douglas County Hospital. Jones Woods and her husband, William Alfred Woods, lived in the Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects while he attended Creighton University. Upon graduating, he became the first African-American to earn an accounting degree there. Wood's fourth child is Cathy Hughes, a successful business entrepreneur from Omaha.

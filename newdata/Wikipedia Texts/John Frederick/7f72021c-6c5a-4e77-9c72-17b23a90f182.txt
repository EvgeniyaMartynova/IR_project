His father had built the exterior of the castle, John Frederick took up decorating the interior.  He commissioned frescoed ceilings and overdoor ornaments.  In 1750, the ballroom was completed by Gottfried Heinrich Krohne.  It is considered a prime example of Rococo interior design in Germany.The princely collection of sheet music had been lost in a fire in 1735.  John Frederick started a new collection to replace it.

He composed music for all kinds of courtly occasionsIn 1746, he founded a theological seminary and supported the founding of an extensive public library.  He added his private library to the existing collection and from 1751 onwards, he allowed the general public to access it once a week.  He considerably extended the collection of the "Princely public library Rudolstadt", founded in 1748, be purchasing scientific literature and numerous valuable books, incunables and oriental manuscripts.  The collection is currently split between the Historischen Bibliothek der Stadt Rudolstadt, and the Schlossbibliothek Heidecksburg.On 4 October 1760, John Frederick granted a license to operate a porcelain factory to Georg Heinrich Macheleid.  John Frederick himself acted as a director for this company, which still exists under the name of Aelteste Volkstedter Porzellanmanufaktur.

On this occasion, John Frederick officially named the building Gymnasium Friedericianum and added a position teaching mathematics and physics.  The ceremony was attended by the Prince and the entire princely household.John Frederick died on 10 July 1767.  As he had no male heir, he was succeeded by his uncle Louis Günther II.

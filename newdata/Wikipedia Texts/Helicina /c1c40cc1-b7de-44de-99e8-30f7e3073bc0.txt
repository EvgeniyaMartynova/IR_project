Helicina (suborder)

Sigmurethra is a taxonomic category of air-breathing land snails and slugs, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. This is an informal group which includes the majority of land snails and slugs.
The two strong synapomorphies of Sigmurethra are a long pedal gland placed beneath a membrane and retractile tentacles.Several families in this group contain species of snails and slugs that create love darts.
Sigmurethra are known from the Cretaceous to the Recent periods.

=== New families after 2005 ===
Superfamily Streptaxoidea
Diapheridae - In 2010, Sutcharit et al. (2010) established a new family Diapheridae within the Streptaxoidea.


=== 2017 Taxonomy ===
After excluding groups not related, the informal group Sigmurethra becomes Suborder Helicina, with the following nine infraorders and a collection of families with no superfamily：
Suborder Helicina ("Non-Achatinoid Clade")
Infraorder Arionoidei
Infraorder Clausilioidei
Infraorder Helicoidei: formed from Helicoidea Rafinesque, 1815 and Sagdoidea Pilsbry, 1895
Infraorder Limacoidei: formed from original limacoid clade
Infraorder OleacinoideiOleacinoidea: formed from original Testacelloidea but with the family Testacellidae excluded;
Haplotrematoidea: formed from original Rhytidoidea and Haplotrematidae
Infraorder Orthalicoidei
Infraorder Pupilloidei (Orthurethra)
Infraorder Rhytidoidei: formed by Rhytidoidea merging with contents from Acavoidea.
Infraorder Succineoidei (Elasmognatha)

Heligoland (band)

Heligoland are a five-piece band from Melbourne, Australia. The band is now based in Paris, France. Heligoland's songs and sound have been compared to the atmospheric textures and soaring female vocals of Cocteau Twins, the spartan soulfulness of Low and the wistful melancholy of Mojave 3.

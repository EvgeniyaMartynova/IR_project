Robert I of Artois

Robert I (25 September 1216 – 8 February 1250), called the Good, was the first Count of Artois, the fifth (and second surviving) son of Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile.


== Life ==
He received Artois as an appanage, in accordance with the will of his father (died 1226) on attaining his majority in 1237 (aged twenty-one). In 1240 Pope Gregory IX, in conflict with the Emperor Frederick II, offered to crown Robert as emperor in opposition to Frederick, but the French count refused to pretend to such a title.


== Marriage ==
On 14 June 1237 Robert married Matilda, daughter of Henry II of Brabant and Marie of Hohenstaufen.They had two children:

Blanche (1248–1302)
Robert II (1250–1302), who succeeded to Artois.


== Death ==
While participating in the Seventh Crusade, Robert died while leading a reckless attack on Al Mansurah, without the knowledge of his brother King Louis IX. After fording a river, he and a group of Knights Templars charged a Mamluk outpost, during which the Mamluk commander, Fakhr-ad-Din Yusuf, was killed. Embolded by his success, Robert, the Templar knights, and a contingent of English troops charged into the town and became trapped in the narrow streets.  According to Jean de Joinville, Robert defended himself for some time in a house there, but was at last overpowered and killed.

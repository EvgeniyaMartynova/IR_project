Goldmine (magazine)

Goldmine, established in September 1974 by Brian Bukantis out of Fraser, Michigan, is an American magazine that focuses on the collectors' market for records, tapes, CDs, and music-related memorabilia. Each issue features news articles, interviews, discographies, histories, current reviews on recording stars of the past and present. Discographies are included, listing all known releases. Coverage includes rock, blues, country, folk and classical. At one point its chief competitor was DISCoveries (with more of an emphasis on 1950s oldies), which later was purchased by the same owner before folding into it as a single publication.
Goldmine was published bimonthly until 1977, when it became a monthly publication. Its headquarters is in Iola, Wisconsin. Its writers have included Dave Thompson, Harvey Kubernik, Jeff Tamarkin, Colin Escott, Gillian G. Gaar, David Nathan, Steve Roeser and Debbie Kruger.The magazine is produced on newsprint in a tabloid format. It recently promised a radical overhaul, complete with more reviews and the return of old favorite features. However, the most noticeable change is that the format is a much-shrunken letter size document, no longer on the old broadsheet. It remains published by F+W Media.

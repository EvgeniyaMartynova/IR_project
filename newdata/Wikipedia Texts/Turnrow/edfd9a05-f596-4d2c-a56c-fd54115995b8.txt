ULM moved from Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) to Division I-A (now FBS) in 1994 and played as a I-A independent 1994–2000. It became a football-only Sun Belt Conference member in 2001 and joined as a member in all sports in 2006. ULM shared the 2005 Sun Belt Conference football championship with Arkansas State University and the University of Louisiana–Lafayette (ASU received the conference's New Orleans Bowl bid due to tiebreaking procedures). Also, in 2012, ULM had their first winning season as an FBS school going, 8–5, and a bid to the AdvoCare V100 Bowl in Shreveport vs. the Ohio Bobcats, but lost 45–14.ULM basketball coaches have included Arnold R. Kilpatrick, Lenny Fant, and Mike Vining. Fant was the first ULM coach to win three hundred games. Current head coach Keith Richard is a former point guard and alumnus from ULM.
Since being in the Sun Belt, the Warhawks have won conference titles in men's basketball (2006–07 West Co-Champion) and baseball (2008 regular season and 2012 conference tournament).

=== Other activities ===
ULM is home to several award-winning groups including the Sound of Today marching band and the competition cheerleading squad.
The ULM water ski team is the most successful in the history of the collegiate sport, having won 28 National Collegiate Water Skiing Association championships since 1979. In that year, Bayou Desiard was the host site of the national competition.
In 2011, ULM announced the closure of its large Lake C. Oxford Natatorium, which remains in need of repairs totaling at least $1.8 million. Built in 1976 and renovated in 1996, the natatorium needed a new roof, chiller system, new ceilings, lighting, and chemical, pump, and valve replacements. The Student Government Association supported the closure based on low student usage of the facility. After ULM dropped support for "The Nat" as it is often called, the YMCA took over the facility and operated it for nearly two years to accommodate local swimmers. Bowing to economic pressures and the lack of public financial support, "The Nat" closed permanently on April 30, 2014. ULM President Nick Bruno said no plans have been finalized for the development of the land with the closure and presumed razing of the natatorium. Today the site is home to the Bayou Pointe event center.

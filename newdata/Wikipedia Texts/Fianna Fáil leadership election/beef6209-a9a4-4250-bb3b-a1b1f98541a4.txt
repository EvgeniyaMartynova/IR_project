1994 Fianna F치il leadership election

The 1994 Fianna F치il leadership election began in November 1994, when Albert Reynolds resigned as party leader and Taoiseach. Reynolds had been party leader since February 1992 and had served as Taoiseach since then.  His successor was elected by the members of the Fianna F치il parliamentary party on 19 December 1994. Bertie Ahern was the only candidate to stand and was thus elected leader.

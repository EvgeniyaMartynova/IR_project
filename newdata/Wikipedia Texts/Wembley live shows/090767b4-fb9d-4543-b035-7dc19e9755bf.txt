Spice Girls Live at Wembley Stadium

Spice Girls Live at Wembley Stadium is the third video album by English girl group the Spice Girls. It was released on VHS on 24 November 1998 by Virgin Records, and was filmed at Wembley Stadium in London on 20 September 1998 during the Spiceworld Tour. The concert was first broadcast live in a pay-per-view special on Sky Box Office, and although the television broadcast was completely live, studio vocals were dubbed into several songs for the video version of the performance. It received a DVD release in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2008.The show was recorded after Geri Halliwell left the band. Halliwell later revealed in the 2007 documentary film Giving You Everything that she watched the two-hour show from her home in the United Kingdom after only quitting the band four months prior and said "it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do" and that it was "so painful", to which Melanie Brown jokingly replied, "That's her own fault".

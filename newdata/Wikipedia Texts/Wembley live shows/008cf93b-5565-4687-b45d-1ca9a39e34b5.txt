== Track listing and omitted songs ==
Some songs are taken from Friday's performance and some from Saturday's. This is identifiable in two ways. One is the underwear Grohl is wearing (Red on Friday, White on Saturday) which can be seen at points in the video, and secondly any shots containing rainfall are from Saturday, as it did not rain during Friday's performance.

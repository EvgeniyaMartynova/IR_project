The Punta Negra Dam is a concrete-face rock-fill dam on the San Juan River about 28 kilometres (17 mi) west of San Juan in San Juan Province, Argentina. The purpose of the dam is to provide water for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectric power. The 101 metres (331 ft) tall dam supports a 62-megawatt (83,000 hp) power station and together with the Los Caracoles Dam upstream, it will provide for the irrigation of 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres). Construction began in 2009 and the dam and was finished in August 29, 2015. It is being constructed immediately upstream of an diversion barrage.

Kameyama Castle (Yamaguchi) (page does not exist)

158 works and sketches survive of the Japanese artist known only by the art name Tōshūsai Sharaku.  Almost all were made over a ten-month period in 1794–1795, divided into four periods:

5th month of Kansei 6 (May–June 1794) – 28 ōban prints
7th and 8th months of Kansei 6 (July–September 1794) – 8 ōban and 30 hosoban prints
11th and intercalary 11th months of Kansei 6 (November 1794 – January 1795) – 47 hosoban, 13 aiban, and 4 ōban prints
1st month of Kansei 7 (February–March 1795) – 10 hosoban and 5 aiban printsThe print sizes became progressively smaller and the focus shifts from busts to full-length portraits.  The depictions become less expressive and more conventional.  Two picture calendars dating to as early as 1789 and three decorated fans as late as 1803 have been attributed to Sharaku, but have yet to be accepted as authentic works of his.  A number of hanshita-e preparatory drawings have also been found.


== Background ==
In Sharaku's time the Kawarazaki-za, the Kiri-za, and the Miyako-za were the three major kabuki theatre houses of Edo: the Edo San-za.Just over 600 copies of Sharaku's prints are known; only about 100 remain in Japan.  As they are in collections scattered throughout the world general research on Sharaku's works has followed different threads in Japan and the West has proved time-consuming.  Japanese researchers have better knowledge of and access to documents and literature related to Sharaku's time and conditions.  On the other hand, Sharaku's works tend to be in Western collections, including prints for which only one copy is known—of which there are about three dozen.  Three of these are of unknown whereabouts, known only through published photographs.  The largest Western collection is the 70 pieces at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 6 of which are unique; the Art Institute of Chicago (8 unique pieces), New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, and the Guimet Museum in Paris also have substantial collections.  In 1920, Kōjirō Matsukata bought a large number of ukiyo-e prints in Paris and brought them back to Japan.  These 70 pieces reside at the Tokyo National Museum, 3 of which are unique.The prints bear no titles, and descriptive titles vary in both Japanese and English.  Amongst the variations in Japanese are the numbering for the generations of actors; for example, a second-generation actor's name might have nidai (二代) or nidaime (二代目) prepended in some sources and nisei (二世) in others, or the generation might be absent.  The list here does not give variant titles, and the titles given are not official.


=== Print sizes ===
Sharaku's prints appeared in the common print sizes ōban, hosoban, and aiban.  The approximate dimensions of these sizes are:
ōban – 25 by 36 centimetres (10 in × 14 in)
hosoban – 15 by 33 centimetres (6 in × 13 in)
aiban – 23 by 33 centimetres (9 in × 13 in)


=== Periodization ===
Sharaku's prints are divided into four periods.  The prints of the first two periods are signed "Tōshūsai Sharaku" (東洲齊冩樂), and the latter two only "Sharaku" (冩樂).

5th month of Kansei 6 – 28 ōban prints
The 5th month of Kansei 6 fell from 29 May to 26 June 1794.
7th and 8th months of Kansei 6 – 8 ōban and 30 hosoban prints
The 7th month of Kansei 6 fell from 27 July to 25 August 1794, and the eighth month from 26 August to 23 September 1794.
11th and intercalary 11th months of Kansei 6 – 47 hosoban, 13 aiban, and 4 ōban prints
The 11th month of Kansei 6 fell from 23 November to 22 December 1794, and the intercalary 11th month from 23 December 1794 to 20 January 1795.
1st month of Kansei 7 – 10 hosoban and 5 aiban prints
The 1st month of the 7th year of Kansei fell from 19 February to 20 March 1795.The print sizes progressively became smaller and the focus shifts from busts to full-length portraits.  The depictions become less expressive and more conventional.  Two picture calendars dating to as early as 1789 and three decorated fans as late as 1803 have been attributed to Sharaku, but have yet to be accepted as authentic works of his.


== First period ==
Sharaku's first periof is made up of twenty-eight known prints, each in ōban size.  They appeared in the 5th month of Kansei 6, which fell from 29 May to 26 June 1794.  They depict actors in their rôles in the kabuki plays Hana-ayame Bunroku Soga, Katakiuchi Noriai-banashi, Koi Nyōbō Somewake Tazuna, and Yoshitsune Senbon-zakura.


=== Hana-ayame Bunroku Soga ===
Playwright Matsui Yūsuke's Hana-ayame Bunroku Soga (花菖蒲文禄曽我, "Blooming Iris, Soga of the Bunroku Era") is a kabuki adaptation of a true story of revenge, the early 18th-century "Kameyama Vengeance" in which the Ishii brothers Hanzō and Genzō spent 28 years to exact revenge on their father Uemon's murderer.  The story enjoyed great popularity and had several theatrical adaptations.The play débuted at the Miyako-za theatre in the 5th month of 6th year of Kansei.  Many details of it are no longer known.  Ishii Genzō tries to kill his enemy Fujikawa Mizuemon, who instead kills Genzō and his wife.  The plot then follows Genzō's retainer Tanabe Bunzō and Genzō's orphaned son, who set off to exact revenge.  Ōgishi Kurando plays a selfless, stately samurai who lends a hand, and Bunzō's retainer Sodesuke serves as comic relief.  Hakujin Onayo's rôle is unknown, but it is thought she helps out with the revenge.


==== Ōtani Tokuji I as the manservant Sodesuke ====

Sodesuke is a faithful foot-man of the Ishii family.  He is present in the first scene, arriving late to meet his master Ishii Hyōei (石井 兵衛) at a shrine in Hamamatsu in Tōtōmi Province.  He witnesses a group including Fujikawa Mizuemon ambush and kill Hyōei before the shrine under cover of darkness.  Sodesuke brings Hyōei's body to Hyōei's eldest son Genzō, in the middle of Genzō's wedding, and explains what has happened.  Sharaku depicts a shockeded Sodesuke as he arrives at the scene of his master's murder.18 copies are known of the ōban print of Ōtani Tokuji I (1756–1807) as the manservant Sodesuke (初世大谷徳次の奴袖助 Shosei Ōtani Tokuji no yakko Sodesuke); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Japan Ukiyo-e Museum, the Ukiyo-e Ōta Memorial Museum of Art, the Baur Foundation, the Museum of Asian Art, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Harvard Art Museums, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Worcester Art Museum, and another is in a private collection.


==== Sakata Hangorō III as Fujikawa Mizuemon ====

The powerful Mizuemon, resentful at having lost a sword fight to his patron Ishii Hyōei, murders Hyōei and steals from him a secret book on Japanese swordsmanship.  Hyōei's sons attempt revenge, but in the third act Mizuemon kills Hyōei's eldest son Genzō and his wife at the Abe River in neighbouring Suruga Province.  Sharaku depicts Mizuemon at the scene of his murder of Genzō.  The print pairs with the one of Bandō Mitsugorō II as Ishii Genzō.13 copies are known of the ōban print of Sakata Hangorō III as Fujikawa Mizuemon (三世坂田半五郎の藤川水右衛門 Sansei Sakata Hangorō no Fujikawa Mizuemon); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Ukiyo-e Ōta Memorial Museum of Art, the Yamatane Museum, the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Rijksmuseum, the Galerie Berès, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Guimet Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Allen Memorial Art Museum, and a private collection.


==== Bandō Mitsugorō II as Ishii Genzō ====

When Ishii Genzō learns of the murder of his father in the middle of his wedding, he commits himself to revenge.  He attacks the murderer Mizuemon's father in the second act, and in the third tries to kill Mizuemon at the Abe River in Suruga Province, but Mizuemon turns then table and kills Genzō and his wife.  Sharaku depicts Genzō at his encounter with Mizuemon at the Abe River.  The print pairs with the one of Sakata Hangorō III as Fujikawa Mizuemon.9 copies of the ōban print of Bandō Mitsugorō II as Ishii Genzō (二世坂東三津五郎の石井源蔵 Nisei Bandō Mitsugorō no Ishii Genzō); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Nara Prefectural Museum of Art, the Galerie Berès, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Royal Museums of Art and History, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Guimet Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.


==== Sanogawa Ichimatsu III as Hakujin Onayo of Gion and Ichikawa Tomiemon as Kanisaka Tōma ====

Tōma is one of Mizuemon's followers, and Onayo a prostitute of the Gion district.  The print depicts the pair in the fourth act, when Tōma has fallen into such financial ruin that he takes on work as a gidayū reciter in bunraku puppet theatre.  At this point, he becomes involved with Hakujin Onayo, a prostitute of the Gion district.6 copies are known of the ōban print of Sanogawa Ichimatsu III as Hakujin Onayo of Gion and Ichikawa Tomiemon as Kanisaka Tōma (三世佐野川市松の祇園町の白人おなよと市川富右衛門の蟹坂藤馬 Sansei Sanogawa Ichimatsu no Gion-chō no Hakujin Onayo to Ichikawa Tomiemon no Kanisaka Tōma); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Rijksmuseum, the Museum of Asian Art, the Royal Museums of Art and History, and the Art Institute of Chicago, and another is in a private collection.


==== Sanogawa Ichimatsu III as Hakujin Onayo of Gion ====

Hakujin Onayo is a prostitute of Gion, played by Ichimatsu, an onnagata—a male actor who performed female rôles.  Her rôle in the narrative is unknown, but it is thought she helps out with the revenge.  She may have played a rôle similar to that of Okaru in the Kanadehon Chūshingura; Okaru had herself sold into prostitution to raise funds a vendetta.  She wears on her clothes the hiragana character "い" ("i") enclosed in a circle—the same mon crest the karō Ōgishi Kurando wears.10 copies are known of the ōban print of Sanogawa Ichimatsu III as Hakujin Onayo of Gion (三世佐野川市松の祇園町の白人おなよ Sansei Sanogawa Ichimatsu no Gion-chō no Hakujin Onayo).  One copy each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Foundation, the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Royal Museums of Art and History, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art, and the Guimet Museum; and one in a private collection.


==== Sawamura Sōjūrō III as Ōgishi Kurando ====

Ōgishi Kurando is the karō (house elder) of the Momoi daimyō family of Kameyama Castle and sympathizes with the Ishii brothers.  He wears on his clothes a mon crest with the hiragana character "い" ("i") enclosed in a circle, for which Mizuemon mistakes him for a member of the Ishiis in the fifth act and attacks him at a teahouse in Gion.  Kurando discovers that his attacker is Mizuemon, and that he has the secret book of swordsmanship.  Kurando goes on to help the Ishii brothers get their revenge in the seventh act.  Sharaku depicts Kurando at the teahouse in the fifth act.11 copies are known of the ōban print of Sawamura Sōjūrō III as Ōgishi Kurando (三世沢村宗十郎の大岸蔵人 Sansei Sawamura Sōjūrō no Ōgishi Kurando); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Harvard Art Museums, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art; two are in the collection of the Guimet Museum; and two are in private collections.


==== Segawa Kikunojō III as Oshizu, wife of Tanabe Bunzō ====

Oshizu is the wife of the Ishii foot-soldier Tanabe Bunzō, who runs into financial ruin in faithful service to his masters.  The print depicts Oshizu in the sixth act, as they struggle to repay a userer and resort to prostituting their daughter Omitsu.  She wraps her head in a yamai hachimaki (病鉢巻, "sickness headband"), a purple headband of silk crepe often worn in kabuki to indicate sickness.  Above it a yellow comb decorates the hair.  The kimono is white with a faded violet pattern, under which are green and rose garments, all bound with a black obi sash.  The portrait is on a dark mica background, and mica is dusted on the collar.16 copies are known of the ōban print of Segawa Kikunojō III as Oshizu, wife of Tanabe (三世瀬川菊之丞の田辺文蔵妻おしづ Sansei Segawa Kikujurō no Tanabe Bunzō Oshizu); one each in the collection of the Tokyo National Museum, the Hagi Uragami Museum, Hiraki Ukiyo-e Foundation, the British Museum, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art, the Guimet Museum, the Harvard Art Museums, the Museum Five Continents, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna; and three are in private collections.


==== Ichikawa Yaozō III as Tanabe Bunzō ====

Bunzō is an Ishii retainer who devoted himself to the brothers' revenge.  In the third act, at the Abe River in Suruga Province in the third act, Mizuemon's group fends off Genzō's group, kills Genzō and his wife, and cripples Bunzō with a wound to the leg.  The print depicts Bunzō in the sixth act as an impoverished rōnin at the Ishibe-juku in Ōmi Province.11 copies are known of the ōban print of Ichikawa Yaozō III as Tanabe Bunzō (三世市川八百蔵の田辺文蔵 Sansei Ichikawa Yaozō no Tanabe Bunzō); one each in the collecion of the Tokyo National Museum, the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Foundation, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,  the Royal Museums of Art and History, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Grabhorn Collection at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, the Guimet Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, and the Harvard Art Museums; and one is in a private collection.


==== Arashi Ryūzō II as Ishibe Kinkichi the moneylender ====

The name "Ishibe Kinkichi" is used as a common noun in Japanese to refer to a person with an inflexible character; the play's character, a moneylender at Ishibe-juku in Ōmi Province, has a personality lacking in humanity and empathy.  In the sixth act, when the destitute Tanabe Bunzō and his wife Oshizu are unable to repay a debt to him, Kinkichi has them sell him their daughter Omitsu as a prostitute.  The actor Ryūzō was known as a master of villainous rôles, and Sharaku's print expresses his hard, unempathetic character in this scene.22 copies are known of the ōban print of Arashi Ryūzō II as Ishibe Kinkichi the moneylender (二世嵐竜蔵の金貸石部金吉 Nisei Arashi Ryūzō no Kanekashi Ishibe Kinkichi).  One each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, Jōsai University, the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Foundation, the Yamatane Museum, the British Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Royal Museums of Art and History, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Guimet Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Harvard Art Museums, the Museum of East Asian Art, Cologne, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Yale University Art Gallery; two are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and four are in private collections.  It holds the record auction price for a Sharaku print; it sold for €389000 at Piasa in Paris in 2009.  It had earlier sold at Sotheby's in 1975 for US$25000 and in 1989 at Christie's for GBP£22000.


==== Segawa Tomisaburō II as Yadorigi, wife of Ōgishi Kurando, and Nakamura Man'yo as the chambermaid Wakakusa ====

The scene is from the seventh act, at the Ōgishi manor below Kameyama Castle.  The print contrasts Tomisaburō's slender face with the jowly Man'yo.7 copies are known of the ōban print of Segawa Tomisaburō II as Yadorigi, wife of Ōgishi Kurando, and Nakamura Man'yo as the chambermaid Wakakusa (二世瀬川富三郎の大岸蔵人妻やどり木と中村万世の腰元若草 Nisei Segawa Tomisaburō no Ōgishi Kurando tsuma Yadorigi to Nakamura Man'yo no koshimoto Wakakusa).  One each is in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Foundation, the Rijksmuseum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Dutch National Museum of Ethnology, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.


==== Segawa Tomisaburō II as Yadorigi, wife of Ōgishi Kurando ====

Tomisaburō was a student of Segawa Kikunojō III, whose style as an onnagata he imitated.  He was considered a versatile actor who excelled at rôles as young girls and courtesans, but who lack in social graces, for which he was given nicknames such as Iya-Tomi or Niku-Tomi (both roughly "Horrid Tomi").It is not known what scene this image represents, but it is assumed to be a different one from that of the other portrait of Yadorigi, as her clothes are different.  Some have suggested the scene may be from Act 5.10 copies are known of the ōban print of Segawa Tomisaburō II as Yadorigi, wife of Ōgishi Kurando (二世瀬川富三郎の大岸蔵人妻やどり木 Nisei Segawa Tomisaburō no Ōgishi Kurando tsuma Yadorigi); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Hagi Uragami Museum, Jōsai University, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Royal Museums of Art and History, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and two at the Guimet Museum.


=== Katakiuchi Noriai-banashi ===
Katakiuchi Noriai-banashi (敵討乗合話, "A Medley of Tales of Revenge") by the playwright Sakurada Jisuke débuted at the Kiri-za in the 5th month of the 6th year of Kansei.  The play combines two revenge tales: Katakiuchi Ganryūjima (巌流島, "Ganryū-jima Revenge") and Gotaiheiki Shiroishi Banashi (碁太平記白石噺, "The Tale of Shiroishi and the Taihei Chronicles").  The play's villain Shiga Daishichi murders Matsushita Mikinoshin, whose death his daughters Miyagino and Shinobu spend years to avenge, with the help of Gorobē, a fishmonger of San'ya.


==== Onoe Matsusuke I as Matsushita Mikinoshin ====

Mikinoshin is a rōnin who has fallen sick and fallen into poverty; he is the father of two daughters, Miyagino and Shinobu.  Sharaku depicts him in a miserable state here in the third act, in which the villains Shiga Daishichi and an accomplice murder him.  Onoe Matsusuke was best known for his rôles as villains, but performed in this play as the lead protagonist.ōban print of Onoe Matsusuke I as Matsushita Mikinoshin (初世尾上松助の松下造酒之進 Shosei Onoe Matsusuke no Matsushita Mikinoshin)

==== Morita Kan'ya VIII as the palanquin-bearer Uguisu no Jirōsaku ====

Jirōsaku is Miyagino's palanquin-bearer, and has transported Miyagino to the red-light district to visit his daughter, whom he has sold into prostitution.  Jirōsaku appears during the performance of the dance segment "Hana-ayame omoi no kanzashi" (花菖蒲思笄, "Iris Headdress of Remembrance") in the fourth act.  He takes the rôle of Japanese bush warbler in the dance, opposite Soga no Jūrō Sukenari disguised as Gorobē as lesser cuckoo; Jūrō is a faithful servant of the Sogas.9 copies are known of th eōban print of Morita Kan'ya VIII as the palanquin-bearer Uguisu no Jirōsaku (八世森田勘弥の駕篭舁鴬の治郎作 Hassei Morita Kan'ya no kagokaki Uguisu no Jirōsaku); one each is in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Yamatane Museum, the Museum of Asian Art, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Royal Museums of Art and History, the Guimet Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Allen Memorial Art Museum.


==== Matsumoto Yonesaburō I as Kewaizaka no Shōshō, actually Shinobu ====

There are few details about Bōdara Chōzaemon and Gon of the Kanagawaya, who appear together in this print, but they are said to have been minor characters in Katakiuchi Noriai-banashi.  Sharaku has nonetheless delineated their traits as carefully as he has those of the main characters.


=== Koi Nyōbō Somewake Tazuna ===
Koi Nyōbō Somewake Tazuna (恋女房染分手綱, "The Loving Wife's Particoloured Reins") débuted in 1751 in Osaka as a bunraku puppet play and arrived in Edo later the same year as a kabuki play at the Nakamura-za (later called the Miyako-za).The scene focuses on the adulterous relationship of Date no Yosaku, who is a retainer of the Yurugi clan of Tanba Province, and the woman-in-waiting Shigenoi.  Trouble befalls the couple at the hands of those such as the wicked retainer Washizuka Happeiji, who has the manservant Edobei steal public funds from Yosaku.  Shigenoi gives birth to Yosaku's son, and he father, the Noh master Takemura Sadanoshin, takes responsibility by killing himself by seppuku.  The Yurugi daimyō takes in Shigenoi as a wet nurse for his daughter Shirabe-hime, but she is forced to part with Yosaku and their son.
Amongst the other characters Sharaku depicts are the Yurugi house's messenger Sagisaka Sanai, Yosaku's manservant Ippei; the character Osagawa Tsuneyo II plays is not certain, but may be Ippei's sister Osan.

=== Shinozuka Uraemon I as the announcer at Miyako-za ===

Before a performance and between scenes, a backstage representative or one of the actors came onstage to give a kōjō (口上) announcement to the audience about such things as scene changes, actors' name changes, and actor promotions.  Here, the actor Shinozuka Uraemon I wears the Miyako-za mon crest on his sleeve and reads an announcement that bleeds through the scroll he holds.  It reads:
口上 自是二番目 新板似顔奉 入御覧候
Kōjō: Kore yori nibanme shinban nigao goran ni ire tamatsuri sōrō
Kōjō: We will show you part two of the newly published actors' portraits.Seven copies are known Shinozuka Uraemon I as the announcer at Miyako-za (篠塚浦右衛門の都座口上 Shinozuka Uraemon no Miyako-za Kōjō); one each are in the Tokyo National Museum, the British Museum, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Royal Museums of Art and History, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

== Third period ==
47 hosoban, 13 aiban, and 4 ōban prints make up the third period (1794–1795).  They appeared in the eleventh month of the 6th year of Kansei.11 of the 13 aiban prints are ōkubi yakusha-e.  Amongst the details that set these works apart from Sharaku's earlier and later ones are the inclusion of a crest in the corner of each, and five of these prints feature clearly visible ears drawn with six lines, whereas those of Sharaku's other works are drawn with five lines.  Hiroshi Matsuki proposed that these 11 prints could be attributed to Kabukidō Enkyō, an artist who produced 7 known prints in c. 1796 and whose identity is unknown.  Enkyō is the only other ukiyo-e artist known to have produced aiban-sized ōkubi-e yakusha-e during the Edo period.

=== Miscellaneous prints ===
Sharaku produced only two known musha-e warrior prints: one of Soga Gorō battling Gosho Gorōmaru and the other of
Taira no Koremichi battling an oni demon at a maple-leaf viewing party.  Such prints may have been an attempt by Sharaku to avoid being pigeon-holed as an actor-print designer.


==== Soga Gorō and Gosho Gorōmaru ====

One copy is known of the aiban print of Soga Gorō and Gosho Gorōmaru 曽我五郎と御所五郎丸 Soga Gorō and Gosho Gorōmaru); it is in the collection of the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Foundation.In 1193 the shōgun Minamoto no Yoritomo held the Fuji no Makigari, a grand hunting party in the area of Mount Fuji.

In the ensuing fighting Jurō was killed and Gorō captured by the sumo wrestler Gosho Gorōmaru, who served at Yoritomo's palace (御所 gosho).Gorōmaru's hair is tied in a karawa-mage topknot, a hairstyle worn by male youths during the Kamakura period.


==== Maple leaf-viewing ====

One copy is known of the aiban print of maple leaf-viewing (紅葉狩 写楽 Momiji-gari); it is in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.The print illustrates the Momiji Densetsu, which has had various theatrical and other adaptations.  The story tells of the Heian-period warrior Taira no Koremichi, who comes across a respectable woman and her handmaidens holding a maple leaf-viewing party.  He joins the party and drinks himself unconscious.  When he awakens, the women have revealed themselves as oni demons.  The print illustrates a fierce battle between Koremichi and a demon who holds him by the topknot.


==== Ebisu ====

One copy is known of the aiban print of Ebisu (恵比寿), one of the Seven Lucky Gods in Japanese mythology; it is in the collection of the Japan Ukiyo-e Museum.Since the beginning of the Edo period, merchants in particular worshipped Ebisu as the god of wealth, long life, and happiness.

The sensu folding hand fan of Matsumoto Kōshiro IV as Kakogawa Honzō and Matsumoto Yonesaburō as Konami is in the collection of the Museum of Asian Art of Corfu.The fan measures about 50 cm.  It was identified and confirmed as a Sharaku work in 2008 and is believed to depict a scene from a May 1795 performance of Kanadehon Chūshingura.  Rather than a print, the fan is a nikuhitsu-ga painting on chikushi bamboo paper.  It is signed (not stamped) Tōshūsai Sharaku ga (東洲齊冩樂画).


== Hanshita-e ==
Preparing a print involved having the print designer produce an ink drawing, which was then transferred to thin Mino paper.  The woodblock carver pasted this tracing, called a hanshita-e (版下絵), face-down onto the woodblock.  The carver cut around the lines visible through the paper to make the key printing block.

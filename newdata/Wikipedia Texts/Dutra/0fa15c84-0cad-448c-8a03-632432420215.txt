Sérgio Dutra Santos

Sérgio Dutra dos Santos, known as Serginho or Escadinha (born 15 October 1975) is a Brazilian volleyball player, a former member of Brazil men's national volleyball team and a player of Sport Club Corinthians Paulista restructured volleyball team, his beloved club, 2004 and 2016 Olympic Champion, double silver medalist of the Olympic Games (2008, 2012), World Champion (2006, 2010), multimedalist of the World League, South American Championship, World Cup and the Grand Champions Cup, 2011 Brazil Champion. In 2009 he became the first libero to be named Most Valuable Player in the history of the FIVB World League.


== Career ==
He is widely regarded as one of the best liberos of all time and is unquestionably the best libero of the 2000s, with more awards than any other libero. Known for his outstanding service reception and digging capabilities, teams often attempt to avoid Sergio when serving. Beyond his defensive abilities, he is also capable of running the offense as a 'second setter' if the setter is forced to make the first contact. This is in large part due to Sergio playing the setting position while growing up and subbing in as a setter for his professional club teams over the years.
Sergio is multimedialist of every volleyball tournament in 2000s. He is seven-time South American Champion and he won with Brazil every South American Championship during his whole career in national team. In 2002 and 2006 he achieved titles of World Champion. During his career he achieved 7 gold and 3 silver medals of FIVB World League.
In his achievements are also medals in World Cup, World Grand Champions Cup and Pan American Games.
In 2004 he became an Olympic Champion for the first time. However, on the next two Olympics, the Brazilian national volleyball team won silver medals only. Serginho semi-retired from the national team after the 2012 Olympics, and returned only for the 2015 World League. After that he declined to compete at the 2016 Rio Olympics, but was persuaded by Bernardinho to return. Bernardinho claimed that, while Serginho no longer had the agility that made him famous, he had experience and maturity to lead the team during a tournament that would certainly be rife with pressure on the Brazilian team, since they were playing on their country and coming from two losses on previous Olympics. Serginho was essential to motivate his team against France. They were losing, and on a break Serginho told his colleagues that, while they all had at least one more chance at going to the Olympics, he didn't – those would be his last Olympic Games. Eventually, Brazil won the gold medal against Italy, and Serginho was acclaimed by the cheering fans, who called him king. After the match against Italy, Serginho was named the tournament's most valued player. He announced after Rio finals against Italy he will play professionally for two more years.

Konami Game Master

The Game Master (Japanese: コナミのゲームを10倍楽しむカートリッジ, Hepburn: Konami no Gēmu o Jū-bai Tanoshimu Kātorijji, lit. "The Cartridge That Makes Konami Games Ten Times More Enjoyable") is a utility cartridge released by Konami on December 12, 1985.  It is meant to be used in conjunction with Konami's own MSX game cartridges, allowing users to select their stages, adjust the number of lives, save progress and high scores, make screen dumps, and play in slow motion, among other uses.
An updated model called the Game Master II (コナミの新１０倍カートリッジ, Konami no Shin Jū-bai Kātoriji) was released on February 18, 1988. This new version adds support for MSX2 games and features a battery backup that allows users to save data via S-RAM from compatible games (such as Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake).

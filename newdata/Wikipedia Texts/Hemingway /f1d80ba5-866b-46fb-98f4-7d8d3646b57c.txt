== Music ==
For the music, vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump undertook his usual role as the band's primary composer. 

"I remember reading an interview with David Bowie where he said, "One day I decided to write a song that sounded like the Rolling Stones"─you know, where the riff is the entire song? And that's how he wrote "Rebel Rebel." I wanted to do the same with "The Take Over.” Classic Rock? Yeah, sure, I guess it is." --Patrick Stump, on the song's style.

=== Technical information ===
Alan Ferguson directed the music video for the song, having worked with the band previously. Sheira Rees-Davies and Luke Joerger handled production duties. Post production and VFX work was done by Jeff Spangler. The music video is shot in grayscale and was filmed in one day.


=== Plot ===
The video begins with Hemingway (Pete's dog), who is lying with Pete on his couch. The camera zooms into his mind (which, as it is doing so, is set to some of Fall Out Boy's earlier songs such as "Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy" , "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" and "Dance, Dance") to where Alex Wolff (from The Naked Brothers Band) is posing as Pete with Hemingway, as if being a younger Wentz.
Then the band is performing the song. As they sing the chorus, strange things begin to happen such as Patrick growing a steak body and a cat head, along with breakdancing mailmen and cat ladies appearing (including dancer Olivia Cipolla).
Through the guitar solo, an angry mob appears and blames the band for changing (a reference to the band's changing genre from a more punk rock sound to a more pop rock/pop-punk sound as stated on many blogs and fan sites on the web) and they start throwing objects at the band and harassing them. Hemingway then comes in and tells the mob "Give the boys a break. Everybody changes. I mean, look at me, I used to be tiny."
The fans then agree and the band continues to play as the fans, the breakdancing mailmen and cat ladies all dance along. Suddenly, the dance ends when Pete falls over, knocking Hemingway out of his dream and causing him to jump off the couch and end the video.


== Chart performance ==
The single found greatest success in Australia where it peaked at No. 17 on the ARIA singles chart, becoming the third consecutive top 20 single from Infinity on High in that region. It finished at No. 90 on the year-end singles charts in Australia. Despite spending six weeks in the UK Top 75, ""The Take Over, the Breaks Over"" became the band's first single to fail to chart in the UK Top 40 since all the singles from Fall Out Boy's 2003 Take This to Your Grave album failed; it peaked at No. 48 in the UK Singles Chart on July 8, 2007. It dropped down to No. 56 the following week before rising again to No. 48 during its third week. The song reached No. 30 in New Zealand.

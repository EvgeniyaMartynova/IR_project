St. Nersess Theological Review

The St. Nersess Theological Review (abbreviated as SNTR) is an Armenological publication established in 1996 by St. Nersess Armenian Seminary and published semi-annually (at times annually or with varying frequency). The founding editor was Abraham Terian who ran the journal for many years. Presently, the journal is edited by Roberta R. Ervine.
SNTR publishes articles about Christianity in the Armenian Church; e.g. theology, liturgy, philosophy, ethics, biblical studies, canon law, church history, ecumenics, literature, fine arts, archaeology, and interdisciplinary studies, as well as translations of Armenian patristic texts. It also publishes short notes, review articles and book reviews in all fields related to the Armenian Church.

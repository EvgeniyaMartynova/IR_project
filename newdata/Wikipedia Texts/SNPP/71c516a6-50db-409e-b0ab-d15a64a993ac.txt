Smolensk Nuclear Power Plant

Smolensk Nuclear Power Plant (Russian: Смоленская АЭС [pronunciation ]) is a nuclear power station in Russia. 
It is located in the Smolensk region, in Desnogorsk province, approximately 100 km from Smolensk, 115 km from Bryansk and 320 km from Moscow. Smolensk Nuclear Power Plant is the biggest nuclear plant in the Nechernozem region of Russia.
The plant operates three RBMK-1000 reactors (1000 MW water-cooled graphite-moderated channel-type reactors). 
The plant was supposed to have four units but the construction of the 4th reactor was stopped in 1993 following the Chernobyl disaster.
All the units are equipped with emergency response systems, which can prevent release of radioactive material into the environment even in case of serious accident; for example breakage of pipes in the reactor cooling circuit. The reactor cooling circuit is housed in hermetic reinforced concrete boxes that can withstand a force of 4.5 kgf/cm2.

== History ==
VitrA’s started in 1942 when a Ceramic Factory was built in Kartal, Turkey.
After the war, the company started growing rapidly, its core production being ceramic plumbing fixtures. This represented a real innovation in the Turkish market, dominated by marble. The ceramic novelty brought to an immediate success, so much that in 1958 a second production plant was created.
In 1966 the VitrA brand name was adopted. Also, this began representing a large range of plumbing products. Another ceramic factory was then created in 1977, a fittings plant in 1979, and a tiles factory in 1991. The following year, a bathroom furniture factory was created.


== Export ==
The early 1980s saw the company begin to exports its products, initially to Germany. In 1999 a factory was acquired in Ireland. Today the company exports to over 80 countries.

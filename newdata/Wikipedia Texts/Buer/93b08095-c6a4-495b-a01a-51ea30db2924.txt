Buer (demon)

Buer is a spirit that appears in the 16th-century grimoire Pseudomonarchia Daemonum and its derivatives, where he is described as a Great President of Hell, having fifty legions of demons under his command. He appears when the Sun is in Sagittarius. He teaches natural and moral philosophy, logic, and the virtues of all herbs and plants (through the use of reversals), and is also capable of healing all infirmities. To accomplish his work, he forcefully re-orders the elements of the pentagram. According to some accounts, he also bestows familiars.He has been described as being in the shape of Sagittarius, which is as a centaur with a bow and arrows. Additionally, Louis Le Breton created an illustration of Buer, later engraved by M. Jarrault, depicting the demon as having the head of a lion (or a mountain man) and five goat legs surrounding his body to walk in every direction.

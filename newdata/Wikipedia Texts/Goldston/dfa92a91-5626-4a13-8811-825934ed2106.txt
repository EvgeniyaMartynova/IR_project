Goldston is located on a spur of the Norfolk Southern Railway that runs between Greensboro and Sanford. The railroad was historically important to the growth of the town.

Until a few years ago many older Southern-marked freight gondolas could be found parked on a side track downtown and at the nearby old Pomona Clay pit.
Most of the rail traffic that comes through town is local freight between Sanford and Greensboro or freight going to the Aberdeen, Carolina and Western Railway, which connects 4 miles (6 km) to the southeast of Goldston in the village of Gulf. Most of this freight is composed of grain hopper cars going to local poultry feed mills. Norfolk Southern Right of Way Maintenance equipment and cars are also frequently parked on the side trackage in Goldston.

Miss Missouri Teen USA

The Miss Missouri Teen USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Missouri in the Miss Teen USA pageant. It is directed by Vanbros and Associates, based in Lenexa, Kansas. In 1993, Missouri joined the Vanbros group of state pageants for the Miss USA and Teen USA system.
Six Missouri teens have gone on to compete at Miss USA, although only four as Miss Missouri USA. The other two represented Kansas, another Vanbros state.
Two notable Miss Missouri Teen USAs (who both later won the title Miss Missouri USA) are Larissa Meek and Melana Scantlin, who appeared on the reality TV show Average Joe.
Abilene Lortz of St. James was crowned Miss Missouri Teen USA 2019 on September 16, 2018 at Isle of Capri Casino Hotel in Boonville. She represented Missouri for the title of Miss Teen USA 2019 on April 28, 2019 in Reno, Nevada.

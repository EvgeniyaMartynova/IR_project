Back Hand

Back Hand is the thirteenth album by jazz pianist Keith Jarrett. Originally released in 1974 it features performances by Jarrett's 'American Quartet' which included Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian with Guilherme Franco added on percussion.
Aside from its appearance in The Impulse Years: 1973-1974 boxset, Back Hand has only ever been reissued on compact disc in Japan, packaged in a miniature replica of the original vinyl LP sleeve. It also appeared in Italy, in 2001, as a supplement to "La Repubblica" national newspaper, copyrighted as "Musicom S.R.L."


== Reception ==
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4.5 stars stating "The group (with Jarrett occasionally switching to flute and Redman to the bizarre-sounding musette) is in typically exploratory, yet often melodic form on lengthy renditions of four of Jarrett's inside/outside originals.".

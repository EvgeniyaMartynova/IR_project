Backhand shot (ice hockey)

In ice hockey, a backhanded shot (or backhander) is a shot taken from the backside of the blade. This type of shot is often used on breakaways, penalty shots and in shootouts and is used for deking. Compared to a forehand shot, it is less accurate, less powerful, but more deceptive to goaltenders. It is also used when a player can not pass the puck to someone who is facing the outside bend of the stick.
The setup of this shot begins with the puck on the backhand heel side of the hockey stick. The puck location at this point will be even with or on the outside of the skate opposite of the intended direction of the shot. There will be a weight transfer from one skate to the other, also in the shot direction, when shot commences. At this time the puck will slide along the blade from the heel towards the toe with the eventual release of the puck toward the net. With a backhand shot it is much easier to release the puck from the middle of the blade, rather than the toe, because when shooting backhand the curve is in the opposite direction. The shooter does have some control over the direction of the backhand shot â€” by pointing the stick blade during the follow through, the player can direct the action of the puck. This shot can obviously be used with a straight stick, but can have different shot results.

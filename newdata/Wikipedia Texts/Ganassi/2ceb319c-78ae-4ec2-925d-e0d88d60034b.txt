== Torogan Finesse ==
It was reported in 2015 that the town once hosted what used to be the finest example of a torogan, a huge traditional Maranao house which was the seat of power of the Maranao royalties and Maranao high officials. Unfortunately, for an undisclosed reason, the torogan was demolished by some locals. A group once campaigned for the passage of an ordinance where the architecture of all houses and buildings in Ganassi will follow the okir and the torogan style. Through it, the town would have been the first planned city whose architectural  grandeur is inspired by a traditional Maranao vernacular way of building. However, due to lack of funding available, the campaign went into deaf ears.
In January 2016, the media team went to the municipality and found half of the former Laguindab Torogan of Ganassi still intact and badly needs restoration. Once restored, according to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the Laguindab Torogan can be declared as a National Cultural Treasure like the Kawayan torogan of Marantao. A group of people are planning to nominate the torogans of Lanao del Sur to the UNESCO World Heritage List, but the nomination is being halted as of the moment due to the lack of restoration in some torogans in the area, specifically in Ganassi. The possible nomination of the Laguindab torogan to the National Cultural Treasure list and the UNESCO list is seen to boost the tourism of the area, if the torogan is conserved properly and evaluated by the local government of Ganassi, with aid request from the National Museum or National Commission for Culture and the Arts.

Cardiff International Sports Stadium

Cardiff International Sports Campus (Welsh: Campws Chwaraeon Rhyngwladol Caerdydd), is an athletics stadium and playing fields in the Leckwith area of Cardiff, Wales.
The campus opened in 2009 as part of the major Leckwith Development, which included a new football and rugby stadium, Cardiff City Stadium, and a retail park.
In July 2015, Cardiff Council let the stadium and its grounds to Cardiff and Vale College, who further sublet the sports facilities to Cardiff City House of Sport. This lease runs for 30 years as a result of which the stadium is no longer open to the public during the day, although evening opening is unaffected.

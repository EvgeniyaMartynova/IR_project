== History ==
WZMF's beginnings trace back to the mid-1980s, when a consortium of eight local businessmen pooled their resources to form Endless Mountain Broadcasting. There was no radio station on the air at that time serving Tunkhannock or Wyoming County, and the rugged mountainous terrain often inhibited weaker radio signals from surrounding markets. One of the owner principals for Endless Mountain Broadcasting was Don Sherwood, a Tunkhannock Chevrolet dealer who would go on to pursue a career in politics, leading him to a congressional seat that he would hold from 1999 to 2007. Sherwood and Norman Werkheiser [1], founder and president of Keystone Caps, a truck camper top manufacturing company, were the two majority shareholders in the company.
The station was granted approval for a construction permit in November 1984, and made its debut as WEMR in 1986 with a country music format, as well as a live, local real-time airstaff. Off to a good start, Endless Mountain Broadcasting decided to petition the FCC for an FM license. Former sister station, WYMK (now WCIG and owned by Family Life Ministries), made is debut in July 1990, with the help of additional investors with the resources necessary to put the station on the air.
The addition of WYMK into the WEMR portfolio however, did not meet the financial goals expected by Endless Mountain Broadcasting, and both stations were sold in 1997 to Citadel Licenses, Inc. Operations for both stations were later moved from the WEMR transmitter site on Wilmar Drive in Tunkhannock to Baltimore Drive in Wilkes-Barre, where they occupied space shared with other Citadel-owned stations.
The acquisition of WEMR and WYMK by Citadel did little to reverse its fortunes, with both stations being utilized as little more than simulcast outlets of other Citadel-owned stations. Both stations were sold on May 20, 2003 to its present owner for $515,000.

WEMR had left the air for a period of about 30 days, and much concern was raised over its future. However, owner Ben Smith, according to the website radio-info.com, has assured those concerned that WEMR will continue to operate and is committed to more local programming in the future. However, engineering issues at the Tunkhannock facility had to be worked out in order for the station to continue operations. WEMR returned to the air continuing its WCOZ simulcast on August 31, 2007. WEMR changed to a simulcast of its 107.7 sister station programming classic hits in early 2009, and then changed its call sign to WGMF on June 1, 2009. WGMF became a separate standalone facility in August 2009. The then-WZMF, 730 AM, began a simulcast of WGMF, 1460 AM, on May 5, 2010, under an LMA pending its sale. The sale was completed in June 2010.
WGMF and WZMF swapped call signs on July 4, 2018.
WZMF/WGMF broadcasts a Classic Hits format similar to CBS Radio's Classic Hits WOGL, Philadelphia and KOOL, Phoenix.

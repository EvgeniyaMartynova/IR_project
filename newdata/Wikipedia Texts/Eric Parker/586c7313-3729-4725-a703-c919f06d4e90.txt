In 2006, Parker and then #1 wide receiver Keenan McCardell both ended the season with zero touchdown catches. Teammates LaDainian Tomlinson, tight end Antonio Gates and wide receiver Vincent Jackson accounted for the majority of the Chargers' scores.

In 2007, Eric Parker injured his toe during training camp. This led to the Chargers putting him on season-ending injured reserve. He was released by the team on July 23, 2008.
In March 2009, Eric Parker joined the coaching staff of the San Diego Chargers as a wide receivers and conditioning assistant.
He also coaches wrestling at Helix Charter High School.

During this period, Darone also toured and recorded with ex-Misfits guitarist Bobby Steele in The Undead. As a graphic designer, Darone worked under the name Zeckle and has created album covers and logos for a wide range of artists including Madonna and Van Halen.In 2000, Darone continued in his role as a drummer/art director with the New York power-pop band, The Rosenbergs.

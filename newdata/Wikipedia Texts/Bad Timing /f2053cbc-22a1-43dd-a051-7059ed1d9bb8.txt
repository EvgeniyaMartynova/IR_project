Bad Timing (album)

Bad Timing is the first conventional song-craft album by American musician Jim O'Rourke. Although O'Rourke releases experimental music nearly every year, this album marked the beginning of his series on Drag City Records which focuses on standard song structures.  It is an instrumental album, consisting largely of Jim O'Rourke's acoustic guitar playing (much in the style of John Fahey), sometimes with additional instrumentation.
The album is named after the 1980 film Bad Timing: A Sensual Obsession, directed by Nicolas Roeg. It is one of a trio of O'Rourke albums, along with Eureka and Insignificance, to be named after Roeg films from the 1980s.
This album is a favorite of Wilco's Jeff Tweedy.

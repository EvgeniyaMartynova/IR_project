Since December 2012, citizens from countries requiring an entry visa for Argentine nationals –  including Australia and Canada –  are charged a "reciprocity fee" to enter Argentina, equivalent to the price the countries charge Argentine citizens for a visa. Until December 2012 (2012-12) the tax was collected, in Argentine pesos or US dollars, at the airport; since then, the tax must be paid in advance online from the country of origin. As of 23 August 2016, the Argentine Government (Presidential Decree No. 959/2016) has resolved to suspend the collection of the reciprocity fee from US passport holders who visit the country for less than 90 days, for tourist or business purposes.In October 2012 Ezeiza Airport recorded the highest annual traffic growth of all the airports operated by Aeropuertos Argentina 2000.

On August 3, 2018, "UDK" was released as the lead single from the album. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar, O'Brien said the song is to "tell those people that they only see what I want them to see and assumptions will get them nowhere. I think we can all agree that judging people before you’ve even met them or given them a real chance is wrong."On September 14, 2018, "I Don't Exist" was released as the second single from the album. Nicole Engelman of Billboard said "with deep, soulful vocals, O'Brien sings of being disillusioned with Hollywood’s perfect facade and wonders. "I Don’t Exist" is a poignant depiction of what it feels like to be an outcast in a world that’s too busy to care." A music video accompanied the release, with O'Brien saying "I tried to capture the feeling I had when writing the song... feeling like no one acknowledges your existence, or cares that you are there, even when you are surrounded by people.""Care Less More" was released as the third single from Was It Even Real? on November 9, 2018. This was followed by "Love Myself" on February 1, 2019 and "Just a Boy" on April 19, 2019.

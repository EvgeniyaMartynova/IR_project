Visor (armor)

A visor was used in conjunction with some Medieval war helmets such as the bascinet. The visor usually consisted of a hinged piece of steel that contained openings for breathing ("breaths") and vision. Visors protected the face during battle. Most knights or warriors who wore visors usually were spotted on horses during war, and more specifically in tournaments. The word beaver is sometimes used interchangeably with visor, as in Shakespeare's Hamlet, when Hamlet and Horatio are discussing the Ghost. Hamlet says: "Then saw you not his face?" to which Horatio responds "O yes, my lord. He wore his beaver up [i.e., his visor raised]".

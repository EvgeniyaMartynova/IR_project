Bacurius I of Iberia

Bakur I (Georgian: ბაკურ I, Latinized as Bacurius), of the Arsacid dynasty, was a king of Iberia (natively known as Kartli; ancient Georgia) from 234 to 249.
He is known exclusively from the medieval Georgian chronicles which make him either 21st or 23rd in the royal list of Iberia and merely relates that Bakur was the son of Vach'e.

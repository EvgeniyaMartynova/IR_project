Bacurius III of Iberia

Bakur III (Georgian: ბაკურ III, Latinized as Bacurius) (died 580) was the last Chosroid king of Iberia (natively known as Kartli; ancient Georgia) upon whose death the Iberian monarchy was abolished by Sassanid Iran.
He succeeded his father, King P'arsman VI, as the king of Iberia. The date of his accession to the throne is unknown but he ruled as contemporary of Hormizd IV of Iran. Bakur's authority was rather limited and hardly extended beyond his fortress at Ujarma while the capital Tbilisi, and Inner Iberia was governed more directly by the Sassanids. When he died in 580, Hormizd IV took opportunity to abolish the kingship in Iberia.

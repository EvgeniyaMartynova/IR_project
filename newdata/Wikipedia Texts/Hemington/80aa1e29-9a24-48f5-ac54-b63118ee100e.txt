Hemington, Leicestershire

Hemington is a village in Leicestershire, England.In 1790, the nearby Harrington Bridge was built to create a crossing of the River Trent. The new bridge was a toll bridge and everyone except locals living in Hemington or Sawley (in Derbyshire) were required to pay the toll.Hemington was historically a chapelry in the parish of Lockington. It became a separate civil parish in 1866, but in 1936 the parish was abolished and reunited with Lockington to form the civil parish of Lockington-Hemington.Gravel quarrying at Hemington during the 1990s led to the discovery of three sets of remains from successive medieval bridges across the Trent.Although there is not a rail station in the village, East Midlands Parkway opened early in 2008 at Ratcliffe-on-Soar providing links on the Midland Main Line.

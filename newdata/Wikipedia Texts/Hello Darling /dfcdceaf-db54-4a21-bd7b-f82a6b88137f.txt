== History ==
Allo Darlin' was started as a solo project by Australian singer and songwriter Elizabeth Morris whilst living in London, England. The band name came from her time working in Soho. "I used to work near the market sellers," she said. "Every day I'd walk past and the old guys would yell out "Allo darlin'" as they ashed into their fruit bowls."In early 2009, a full band lineup of Allo Darlin' formed with guitarist Paul Rains, drummer Michael Collins, and bassist Bill Botting. They released their first single, "Henry Rollins Don't Dance" on WeePOP! Records, that summer.That year Fortuna Pop! signed the band, and they released two singles, "The Polaroid Song" (2009) and "Dreaming" (2010) before the band's self-titled debut full-length, produced by Simon Trought, was released by the label in the summer of 2010.In 2011 Allo Darlin' self released the "Darren"/"The Wu-Tang Clan" single. The band returned with new album Europe in spring of 2012, released again by Fortuna Pop in the U.K. and this time by Slumberland in the U.S.They spent the next year touring before heading back into the studio to record their third album. We Come from the Same Place was released in October of 2014.

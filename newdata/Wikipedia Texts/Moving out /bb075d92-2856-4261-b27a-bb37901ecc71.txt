The first 4 tracks had originally appeared on as the mini-LP  Sonny Rollins Quintet Featuring Kenny Dorham (PrLP 186), and the final track had appeared on the 10" mini-LP Sonny Rollins and Thelonious Monk (PrLP 190). 


== Reception ==
At Allmusic,  Michael G. Nastos called the group "one of the more potent combos of 1954." Author and musician Peter Niklas Wilson called the album "simply a typical blowing session, in which virtuoso up-tempo playing and a wealth of invention in a well-known framework count for more than structural innovation".

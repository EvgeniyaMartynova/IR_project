== Musical style and reception ==
Regarding his new direction on the album, Shellshock stated to the Los Angeles Times in 2004 "I tried to remove the heavy rock element [of Crazy Town]. This is more surfer hip-hop: hip-hop with reggae overtones, some dance music and R&B influences." Tim Sendra of Allmusic wrote in his review that it is "a surprisingly good album that should be a feature at late-summer slow drags, beach bonfires, and freshman mixers."

== Biography ==
Orville Thomas was the first child of Jah Thomas and Cleopatra Wright. He was raised primarily by his grandmother Ms. Feama who instilled in him the principles of education and religion. She was a strict disciplinarian, who ensured that Da'Ville attended church and sang in the church choir. As a teenager, he continued to sing in the St. Peter Claver Church choir and performed in local school functions.
When highly successful groups emerged on the scene, Da'Ville became inspired to create a group of his own. After several unsuccessful attempts he continued to develop his craft until he graduated from high school. Upon graduation from Norman Manley Comprehensive High School, Da'Ville worked in a factory and as a store clerk. Shortly after, he was introduced to a newly formed group which later became ARP (A Raw Perspective).After working with former group members of ARP, in 2001 he signed with Penthouse Records as a solo artist under the management of Donovan Germain. He recorded the hit singles "Cruzin", and "All My Life", the latter of which was recorded with then label mate, Marcia Griffiths.

Brown and R.(Shams) Browne, for Fashozy Records, was released in Japan by Avex Entertainment Group. The album charted within the 2005 top ten best selling reggae albums for Japan Tower Records and led to numerous tours throughout Japan, Jamaica and the Caribbean Islands.

The albums included three successful singles – "In Heaven", produced by O. Thomas and N. Palmer for Nap Musiq, "Can't Get Over You", and "On My Mind", produced by O. Thomas and J.

"On My Mind", held the top position on several charts including Jamaica (5 weeks), New York (3 weeks), Florida, Europe and Africa.

Mozaiq (album)

Mozaiq is the fourth studio album by the metal band, Blood Stain Child. It was released on July 18, 2007 in Japan and was released on 20 July 2007 in Europe. Mozaiq contains 11 tracks plus an extra track that differs; for Japan "Ez Do Dance" a cover after TRF and for Europe "Cosmic Highway".


== Style ==
Mozaiq is more euro-trance influenced than all their previous materials, stating that it "is really about breaking down the boundaries of what we refer to as Heavy Music". It contains more clean vocals, especially on "Neo-Gothic-Romance". The track "Metropolice" is built upon female vocal samples. Instrumentation is lower-paced than on their previous works, especially their debut album, and synths sometimes cross into industrial/eurodance territory. With the arrival of vocalist Sadew, original lead vocalist Ryo performs only backing vocals on the album in addition to maintaining his role as bassist.

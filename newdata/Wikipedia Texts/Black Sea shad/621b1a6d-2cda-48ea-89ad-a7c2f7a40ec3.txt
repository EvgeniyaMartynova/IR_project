Alosa tanaica

Alosa tanaica, called in English the Azov shad or Black Sea shad, is a species of clupeid fish endemic to the Ponto-Caspian basin. It is an anadromous species, spawning in the lower reaches of rivers. It is widespread in the eastern Black Sea, the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov.
Note that the same common names (Black Sea shad, Azov shad) are connected also to another species, Alosa maeotica.

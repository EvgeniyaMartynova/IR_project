== Description ==
Males measure 27.9–28.8 mm (1.10–1.13 in) and females 30.0–33.1 mm (1.18–1.30 in) in snout–vent length. Male Micrixalus fuscus have a single vocal sac, white patch on the lower jaw, and a prominent nuptial pad on the first finger. Characteristic for the genus, they display the foot-flagging behaviour. Male-male combats also involve kicking.Description from G. A. Boulenger's (1890) "Fauna of British India":

Toes nearly entirely webbed; disks moderate; subarticular tubercles small; a small inner metatarsal tubercle. The tibio-tarsal articulation reaches between the eye and the tip of the snout. Skin smooth above and beneath; a narrow glandular lateral fold; a fold from the eye to the shoulder. Brown or pinkish above; sides of head and body generally darker; limbs with dark cross bands; hinder side of thighs dark brown, with a more or less accentuated light median stripe; whitish beneath, marbled with brown.

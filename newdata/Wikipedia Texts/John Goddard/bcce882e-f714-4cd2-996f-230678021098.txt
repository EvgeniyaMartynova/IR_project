== Club career ==


=== Early career ===
Goddard joined Reading at the age of eight in 2001. He progressed through the youth ranks at the Berkshire club before signing his first professional contract in the summer of 2011, a one-year deal. He spent the majority of the 2011–12 season playing for Reading's development side, although ultimately did not make any first-team appearances for the club. Reading won promotion back to the Premier League that season, and Goddard was told that he would be released upon the expiry of his contract on 30 June 2012.Ahead of the 2012–13 campaign, Goddard joined Conference South side Hayes & Yeading United on a one-year deal. He made his debut for the club in a 1–1 draw away at Weston-super-Mare, featuring for the first 70 minutes before being replaced by Tobi Joseph. Goddard scored once during the season; his solitary goal came from close-range in a 4–1 away win over Eastleigh in the FA Trophy on 10 November 2012. He made 37 appearances in all competitions as Hayes & Yeading finished the season in 17th-place.


=== Woking ===
Goddard spent time on trial at Conference Premier side Woking in July 2013, hoping to secure a contract with the club for the 2013–14 season. He was described as "the pick of an unfamiliar bunch" when he came on as a substitute and scored twice in a 3–2 pre-season friendly defeat to Staines Town. Despite impressing during the trial period, Goddard did not sign for Woking until two weeks into the new season, joining on an initial one-year deal on 1 September 2013. He made his competitive Woking debut in a 2–0 victory over Hyde United on 17 September 2013, replacing Gavin Williams with eight minutes remaining. Goddard scored his first Woking goal in a 2–0 away victory over Gateshead on 15 February 2014, doubling Woking's advantage when he scored from Kevin Betsy's cross in the 70th minute. He went to score three times in 36 appearances during his first season with the club. Shortly after the end of the season, on 5 May 2014, Goddard signed a one-year contract extension to remain at Woking for the 2014–15 season. He scored seven times during his second season with the club, including the first brace of his career in a 3–1 win at Dartford in March 2015, as he made 46 appearances in a campaign that saw Woking narrowly miss out on the Conference Premier play-off places after finishing in seventh-place.The 2015–16 campaign, Goddard's third year at Woking, would ultimately prove to be his breakthrough season. Two goals in the club's second game of the season, a 2–0 victory over Bromley at Kingfield Stadium on 11 August 2015, would serve as the catalyst for Goddard's most prolific goalscoring form of his career as he went on to score seven goals in nine games from midfield. Included in this run of goals was another brace in a 4–4 draw away at Guiseley on 12 September 2015, as well as the winning goal in a 2–1 win against Forest Green Rovers three days later to end the league leaders' unbeaten start to the campaign. He scored two goals within the space of six days in two narrow victories against local rivals Aldershot Town when the two sides met over the festive period. The first came courtesy of the only goal of the game in a 1–0 away win at The Recreation Ground on 26 December 2015, followed by scoring the deciding goal when he beat the offside-trap as Woking secured a 2–1 home win on 2 January 2016. Goddard continued his good form into the second half of the season, despite Woking's dip in form that ultimately resulted in a mid-table finish, and scored in successive games to end the season. He scored 17 goals in 46 appearances from midfield during the campaign. He was named as Woking's Player of the Year at the end of the season.


=== Swindon Town ===
Two weeks after the conclusion of the season, on 13 May 2016, Goddard signed for League One side Swindon Town for an undisclosed fee and on a three-year deal. Swindon stated they had secured Goddard's signature ahead of a number of Championship and rival League One clubs. He made his Swindon debut on the opening day of the 2016–17 season, in a 1–0 victory against Coventry City, playing the full 90 minutes. Goddard scored his first goal for Swindon in a 1–1 draw away at Shrewsbury Town on 1 October 2016, heading in a cross to open the scoring. His second goal of the season came in Swindon's comfortable 3–0 home win over Charlton Athletic on 12 November 2016, scoring Swindon's third goal of the match courtesy of a powerful strike from eight yards. Goddard's third and final goal of the season came in the reverse fixture against Shrewsbury Town on 7 January 2017, who he had scored against three months earlier, in another 1–1 draw. His goal in the match came from the penalty spot. Goddard made the most number of appearances for Swindon during his debut season in the Football League, scoring three times in 48 appearances, as Swindon were relegated to League Two.Goddard suffered a foot injury in Swindon's opening day win at Carlisle United on 5 August 2017, with the injury keeping him out of first-team action for the opening six weeks of the 2017–18 campaign. He scored his first goal of the season on 14 October 2017, "putting the finishing touches to a superb team move" to double Swindon's advantage in an eventual 3–1 away victory over Mansfield Town. He scored in Swindon's 4–2 win over Bristol Rovers in an EFL Trophy group-stage match on 8 November 2017. Despite returning to the first-team picture, 10 of Goddard's 17 appearances during the season had come from the substitute's bench, and he did not play for the final six weeks of his time at Swindon before his exit. He made 65 appearances during his one-and-a-half-year spell, scoring five goals.


=== Stevenage ===
Goddard signed for fellow League Two side Stevenage on 31 January 2018, joining on a two-and-a-half year deal for an undisclosed fee. He made his Stevenage debut on 3 February 2018, playing the opening 74 minutes in a 3–2 away loss at Accrington Stanley. Following the arrival of new manager, Dino Maamria, Goddard fell down the pecking order at Stevenage and only managed to make three further appearances before being transfer listed at the end of the campaign.Goddard joined National League club Bromley on loan at the start of the 2018–19 season, on 17 August 2018, on a deal until January 2019. He made his Bromley debut a day after signing for the club, starting the match and playing 92 minutes in Bromley's first win of the season, a 1–0 home victory over Gateshead.

He made 18 appearances as Aldershot finished in 21st place in the National League.


=== Ebbsfleet United ===
Goddard went on trial with National League club Ebbsfleet United in pre-season ahead of the 2019–20 season. He signed for the club on a permanent basis on 16 July 2019.

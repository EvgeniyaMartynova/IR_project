Ultimate Custom Night

Ultimate Custom Night (often abbreviated to UCN) is a point-and-click survival horror video game created by Scott Cawthon.  It is the second spin-off of the Five Nights at Freddy's series, the first one being FNaF World. The game was released on June 27, 2018 for free on Steam and Game Jolt.


== Gameplay ==
The game allows the player to choose from 50 animatronics from all six main Five Nights at Freddy's games, as well from FNaF World, and set their difficulty levels for the night from a minimum of '0' to a maximum of '20'. During the night, the player must keep track of several mechanics, such as doors, ventilation systems, and air duct systems, to avoid being attacked by the animatronics. The player can use "Faz-Coins", which can be used to earn power-ups and deflect animatronics, and the "Death Coin", which can eliminate certain animatronics from the current game. The player is also able to select the office setting they want to play in, choose power-ups that may help them during the night and can select 16 challenges available to them.On final release, sixty-one animatronics from the franchise were included in Ultimate Custom Night.


== Characters ==
Ultimate Custom Night reuses characters from previous entries in the series. These characters include:
Freddy Fazbear 

Freddy Fazbear returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters.
As stated by the character description found in Ultimate Custom Night, Freddy Fazbear appears on CAM 01, the camera that showcases the hallway to the left of the player's office.
Once Freddy Fazbear spawns, he will slowly make his way closer towards the Office left the door, moving in 4 notable phases en route. When seen in his fourth phase, the player has a short amount of time in which they can close the left door or else their night will end with a jumpscare from Freddy.
The speed at which Freddy transitions between phases will increase during the night if the temperature in the Office increases.
The challenges in which Freddy is present are as follows:

Bears Attack 1
Bears Attack 2
Bears Attack 3
Old Friends
Chaos 2Bonnie 
Both Bonnie and his withered counterpart return in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the selectable characters. 
Bonnie resides in Pirate Cove (CAM 05) alongside Foxy. While Foxy must be checked when he's active, the player must AVOID checking Bonnie when he's active, or he will disable the camera system temporarily. Alternatively, Bonnie, along with Foxy, can be removed from the night if the player uses the death coin on him.
The challenges in which Bonnie is present are as follows:

Old Friends
Chaos 3Chica 
Both Chica and her withered counterpart return in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 
Chica resides in the Kitchen (CAM 04) and shows her presence by knocking around pots and pans. However, if the player hears nothing in the kitchen, then this means that Chica has gotten bored with the music playing, and the player must change the music. Once the music is changed, Chica will resume knocking around pots and pans to show that she's content again. She is enraged if the player changes the music too early. Once she is angered, she will leave the kitchen to jumpscare the player, bypassing the hallway and security door.
Alternatively, Chica can be soothed using the Global Music Box, but this puts a substantial drain on the player's power supply. If it's necessary to rely on this music box, she can be handled by turning the box on after 12 seconds and turning it off after 18 seconds, supplemented by other power-saving methods. She is specifically calmed by a shorter pulse, but it is better to use the described pattern.
The challenges in which Chica is present are as follows:

Ladies Night 1
Ladies Night 2
Ladies Night 3
Old FriendsFoxy 
Foxy returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 
Foxy resides in CAM 05 alongside Bonnie. Like in the original Five Nights at Freddy's, the player must check him (but only if the figurine on the player's desk has changed to him) to slow down his attack, or else he'll escape and reach the office. Once he's reached the office, he will take himself apart and his pieces will be slid in through an open door or vent. Once all of his pieces are in the office, he will reassemble himself and jumpscare the player. Alternatively, Foxy can be removed from the night (and Bonnie, if he's active as well) if the player buys the death coin and uses it on him.
The challenges in which Foxy is present are as follows:

Old Friends
Chaos 3Toy Freddy 
Toy Freddy returns in the standalone mashup Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 

Toy Freddy is described as being retired and sits in Parts/Service (CAM 08) playing a parody of Five Nights at Freddy's titled "Five Nights With Mr. Hugs" on a large flat-screen TV set.
The game is shown to have three main hallways, and the character is Mr. Hugs, who may appear on each hallway camera at any given time. Each hallway also has a door that can block Mr. Hugs from jumpscaring Toy Freddy. The goal of the player is to discern which hallway Mr. Hugs is at and close the appropriate door.
If the player fails to close the correct door in time, the television screen will change to one displaying the words "Game Over". This means that Toy Freddy has been jumpscared and is on his way to end the player's night. At this point, there is no way to stop Toy Freddy, and the outcome of the night will be decided on whether the night ends before or after Toy Freddy decides to jumpscare the player. Alternatively, Toy Freddy can be removed from the night if the player uses the death coin on him even if he has already been jumpscared.
The challenges in which Toy Freddy is present are as follows:

Bears Attack 2
Bears Attack 3
Old Friends
Chaos 1Toy Bonnie returns as one of the selectable characters in Ultimate Custom Night.

Toy Bonnie is only seen in the Office and appears randomly throughout the night. There is no way to prevent him or directly lower his chances of appearing.
Toy Bonnie will enter the office signaled by a low buzzing noise and rapidly flickering lights. Toy Bonnie will then enter from the right side of the screen, and pan across towards the middle, twitching constantly. The player generally has until Toy Bonnie makes it towards the middle to put on the mask, or else Toy Bonnie will jumpscare them.
Putting on the mask will cause Toy Bonnie to pan out right and leave the office again, staring at Toy Bonnie with the mask generally makes him leave quicker, which can be used to the advantage of the player.
The challenges in which Toy Bonnie is present are as follows:

Old Friends
Chaos 2
Chaos 3Toy Chica 
Toy Chica makes a return in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 
She sneaks in through a trapdoor to the left side, and just like Toy Bonnie, there is no way to prevent her from getting into the room. The player's only defense is to put on their Freddy Fazbear mask to fool her. Toy Chica is faster than Toy Bonnie and will invade the Office more often, however she is easier to fool with the mask, especially when looking directly at her. 
The challenges in which Toy Chica is present are as follows:

Ladies Night 1
Ladies Night 2
Ladies Night 3
Old Friends
Chaos 2
Chaos 3Mangle 
Mangle returns as one of the selectable characters of Ultimate Custom Night. 
Mangle, like a few other animatronics, will climb into the Vents to attack the player. To fend it off, the player needs to activate one of the three available Vent Snares to block off Mangle's attack. However, once it sneaks into The Office, Mangle will stay there and create garbled noises like in the second game. If the player keeps flicking up the monitor constantly, Mangle will drop down to perform its jumpscare and end the night in the process. Mangle can sneak into the office, even if Withered Chica is stuck in the vent opening,
The challenges in which Mangle is present are as follows:

Ladies Night 1
Ladies Night 2

Pay Attention 1
Pay Attention 2
Old Friends
Chaos 3JJ 

JJ returned in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters.

Ladies Night 1
Ladies Night 2
Ladies Night 3

Chaos 3Withered Chica 
Withered Chica returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 
Like a few other animatronics, Withered Chica will climb into the Air Vents to sneak into the Office. She can be fended off by checking on the Vent Monitor, in which the player has to activate either one of three vent snares that block off an animatronic in the Vents. However, if Withered Chica manages to bypass the Vent system, she'll end up getting stuck at the vent door. Eventually, Withered Chica may wiggle free and jumpscare the player if they pull up their Monitor.
The challenges in which Withered Chica is present are as follows:

Ladies Night 1
Ladies Night 2
Ladies Night 3
Creepy Crawlies 1
Creepy Crawlies 2
Chaos 3Withered Bonnie

Like in the second game, Withered Bonnie will occasionally climb out of an unknown trapdoor to stand in the Office. Once he arrives, Withered Bonnie will create distorted audio noises and cause the lights to flicker. Similar to that of Toy Bonnie and Toy Chica, the Player has to put on the Freddy Mask to fend him off. Otherwise, he'll proceed to jumpscare the Player if the mask is put on too slowly.
The challenges in which Withered Bonnie is present are as follows:

Creepy Crawlies 1
Creepy Crawlies 2
Nightmares Attack
Chaos 1
Chaos 3Marionette (more commonly known as the Puppet) 
Like in the second game, the Puppet resides in its music box, now located in the Kitchen. The player needs to wind up the music box to keep it tamed. However, if they neglect its music box, the Puppet will escape and proceed to eventually attack the player. It cannot be put back into its music box, and the ventilation system will start draining much faster, causing blackouts and eventually a game over. If the Global Music Box is activated, the music box will automatically wind itself up (along with soothing other audio-based animatronics), but this puts a substantial drain on the player's power supply.
The challenges in which the Puppet is present are as follows:

Pay Attention 1
Pay Attention 2
Creepy Crawlies 1
Creepy Crawlies 2
Old Friends
Chaos 1
Chaos 2Golden Freddy 

Golden Freddy returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the selectable characters.
Similar to the second game, Golden Freddy in his withered form will appear in the Office after the player lowers the monitor down. Putting on the Freddy Fazbear mask or pulling the monitor back up will cause Golden Freddy to disappear. Failing to do so while staring at him for too long will result in a game over with Golden Freddy's jumpscare.
When unlocking all cutscenes (both Freddy's and Toy Chica's anime cutscenes), the final cutscene will reveal Golden Freddy in his original form from the first game, twitching constantly within pitch blackness.

Chaos 1Nightmare Bonnie 
Nightmare Bonnie returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the selectable characters. 
Nightmare Bonnie, along with Nightmare Mangle and Circus Baby, will attack from the right hall. However, each of them will only attack once per night, and they change their order of attack each night so that the player won't know who to expect first. The main way to counter his attack is to buy a Bonnie plushie from the Prize Corner. On difficulty level 1-9, the plush will cost ten Faz-Coins, on difficulty level 10-19, the plush will cost fifteen Faz-Coins, and on difficulty level 20, the plush will cost twenty Faz-Coins. Doing so will prevent Nightmare Bonnie from entering the Office, as closing the right door can't block off his attack. Alternatively, the player can leave the camera on Nightmare Bonnie the entire night to stall him. The monitor does not need to be up to stall Nightmare Bonnie.

Nightmarionne returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters.
Nightmarionne will become active inside the Office and appear around in random areas. As it appears, the player must dodge their mouse cursor away from Nightmarionne until it completely vanishes away, because hovering the cursor over it slowly makes it appear in solid. Once entirely solid, it will directly jumpscare the player to end the night.
Sometimes on 50/20 mode, Nightmarionne will fully appear at the start in its almost solid appearance, so stay cautious.
The challenges in which Nightmarionne is present are as follows:

Nightmares Attack
Springtrapped

However, if the player takes too long or fails to catch the fish, the Monitor will become inaccessible for a short time, with "ERROR" displaying on the Monitor switch button whenever the player attempts to open it up.
When having Old Man Consequences set to 1 with all characters set to 0, then during gameplay, catching a fish will result in being sent to the 4th layer deep area from FNaF World where Old Man Consequences is. Speaking with him here will result in him saying, "Come and sit with me for a while," prompting the player to press the ENTER key. Doing so will lead to Old Man Consequences' next dialogue text; "Leave the demon to his demons. Rest your own soul. There is nothing else." The player must then exit by rapidly moving left and right above the pond by pressing both A and D keys, which causes the game to crash.

Chaos 3Trash And The Gang 
Trash and the Gang reappear in Ultimate Custom Night as five of the many selectable characters.

No. 1 Crate will sometimes appear at the bottom of the screen in the office, whispering to the player that it has a secret to tell. After a short time, No. 1 Crate will "jumpscare" the player and disappear.
Bucket Bob will randomly jumpscare the player, often doing it after the jumpscare of No. 1 Crate.
Mr. Can-Do appears on some of the cameras, blocking ~80% of the player's view.
Mr. Hugs doesn't act as a part of the gang, though he can be seen in the right hallway (CAM 02) as a background element. Mr. Hugs is also the main antagonist of "Five Nights With Mr. Hugs", the video game played by Toy Freddy.
Pan Stan doesn't appear in the game at all.
The gang is mostly depicted as having joke mechanics due to their random and comedic behaviors, however, they can become dangerous if they distract the player in a bad situation. Their loud jumpscare sound can distract the player, and Mr. Can-Do can block Toy Freddy's game, Funtime Foxy's sign, Bonnie and Foxy's stage, or the currently active plush animatronics at CAM 02.

Creepy Crawlies 1
Creepy Crawlies 2
Chaos 3Rockstar Freddy 
Rockstar Freddy returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 
Rockstar Freddy, as evident by his Quotes in-game, is shown not to have any real personality, seemingly being a Token-receiving Entertainment robot. However, he does appear to be Observant and easily agitated, as evident by 2 of his quotes from the aforementioned game.
Rockstar Freddy will stand in the office throughout the entire night. Occasionally, he will activate (the frequency depends on his difficulty setting) and ask for a payment of five Faz-Coins. Failure to pay him in time will result in him jumpscaring the player and causing a game over.
However, if the player does not have enough Faz-Coins or simply does not wish to pay, they can turn on the Heater, which will cause Rockstar Freddy to malfunction and think payment has been made. However, turning on the heater will make the player more vulnerable to heat-sensitive animatronics such as Freddy, Lefty, and Jack-O-Chica, so the player must decide whether it would be better to turn it on or simply pay the five coins. If the player also turns on the heater too late, he'll still jumpscare the player despite him malfunctioning.
The challenges in which Rockstar Freddy appears are as follows:

Bears Attack 1
Bears Attack 2
Bears Attack 3
Chaos 1
Chaos 2
Chaos 3Rockstar Bonnie 

Rockstar Bonnie returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters.
When active, Rockstar Bonnie will periodically appear in the center within the Office, but only if you linger for too long on the cameras. If this happens, the player must pull up the Monitor and search for his guitar, which is found randomly in any camera location. The guitar is located in the bottom left or right side of the screen, and double-clicking on the guitar makes Rockstar Bonnie vanish. The player has approximately 20 seconds to locate Rockstar Bonnie's guitar, and if the player fails to find the guitar in time, the lights will flicker and Rockstar Bonnie will immediately jumpscare the player, causing a game over. Alternatively, Rockstar Bonnie can be removed from the night by using the Death Coin on him.
Once dead, he'll give an incredibly gruesome intention of how to end your life! (It wouldn't count because you come back again repeatedly!) I guess Scott Cawthon intended Rockstar Bonnie to be kind of serious and contentious towards his surroundings and who he's going against, and, of course, addicted to his guitar! Ha! It turns he also knows you as the truest friend from one of his death notes, surprisingly.
The challenges in which Rockstar Bonnie is present are as follows:

Chaos 1
Chaos 3Rockstar Chica 
Rockstar Chica returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 
Scott Cawthon describes Rockstar Chica as being loud and obnoxious. As evidenced by her quotes in Ultimate Custom Night, she also has Basiphobia. she also exhibits bloodthirstiness, as evident by finding the smell of fresh meat "Enticing". She also is shown to not like wet floors. She is also shown to have wisecracking tendencies, as evident by one of her quotes in the aforementioned game.
Rockstar Chica can appear in either one of the hallways outside The Office, visible only on the Monitor. When she does appear, the player only has a short time to react. Closing the doors will not ward her off; though it will prevent her from entering, she will simply remain in the hall until the player either switches the camera while the door near her is open or runs out of power. Instead, the player needs to double-click on the wet-floor sign, placing it on either side of the Office where she's approaching from. This is the only way to completely ward her off, presumably due to a fear of slipping (based on her audio dialogue). Alternatively, the player can cam stall Rockstar Chica for the entirety of the night by leaving the wet floor sign on one side of the office while having the monitor on the opposite hallway's camera, thus preventing her entry. The monitor does not have to be up to stall her.
The challenges in which Rockstar Chica is present are as follows:

Ladies Night 1
Ladies Night 2
Ladies Night 3
Chaos 2
Chaos 3Rockstar Foxy 
Rockstar Foxy returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 
Rockstar Foxy has many of the same personality traits as the Original Foxy from Five Nights at Freddy's. In addition to this, he is also shown to be somewhat unpredictable, as evidenced by his behavior in-game(see below).
Rockstar Foxy's parrot will occasionally fly across the Office and the player can choose to either ignore or interact with it. If they choose to interact with the parrot, Rockstar Foxy will be summoned. He'll then offer one of four different boosts to the player:

Adding 1% power to the Office.
Lower temperature to 60 degrees.
Give 10 Faz-Coins.
"Soundproofing" the office, temporarily preventing noise-sensitive animatronics from being affected by sound.However, the player must be aware of these opportunities, as Rockstar Foxy will jumpscare them and cause a "Game Over" if he appears to be in a bad mood. The higher his difficulty level, the less often his parrot will appear, and the higher the chance a death will occur. Therefore, when the parrot appears, the player needs to choose wisely between summoning Rockstar Foxy or saving their skin. Unlike the other animatronics, Rockstar Foxy is still active when his difficulty level is 0 and still has a chance to kill the player. Dee Dee can increase his AI, making his bird appear less often and increasing the risk of getting attacked.
Rockstar Foxy can appear in any challenge, even in ones where his difficulty level is 0. The challenges where he has a set difficulty are as follows:

Springtrapped
Chaos 1
Chaos 2
Chaos 3Music Man 
Music Man returns as one of the many selectable characters in Ultimate Custom Night. 
Music Man is directly behind the player when he's active, and he's sound sensitive. If the player makes noise, then Music Man will begin to crash his cymbals together. The more noise the player makes, the faster Music Man will crash his cymbals, until he eventually jumpscares the player.
The following things can annoy Music Man and induce progress towards his jumpscare:

The fan.
Phantom Mangle's garbles.
Mangle's garbles.
Phone Guy's calls.
Any devices on the Monitor (except the Silent Ventilation and the Global Music Box).
Lolbit.To soothe Music Man, the player can reduce the noise level and/or prevent noise-making animatronics by:

Putting down the monitor or changing camera maps before Phantom Mangle can appear in the office.
Reducing usage of the fan.
Muting Phone Guy as quickly as possible.
Snaring Mangle with the vent snares before it reaches the vent door.
Reducing usage of devices from the monitor.
Typing "L-O-L" to remove Lolbit.Doing these actions will make Music Man slow down the cymbal crashing until he eventually stops.
The challenges in which Music Man is present are as follows:

Pay Attention 1
Pay Attention 2
Creepy Crawlies 1
Creepy Crawlies 2
Nightmares Attack
Chaos 1
Chaos 2
Chaos 3El Chip 

Though while El Chip does not physically appear in the night to jumpscare or attack the player, he only appears in his various restaurant advertisement pop-ups as a distraction. When his advertisement image comes up, there are two simple ways to get rid of it quickly before going back focusing on gameplay; Click the "SKIP" button or press the ENTER key.
Each advertisement pop-up only lasts 7 seconds, however allowing the advertisement to play out increases the chance of having one of the animatronics attack.
The challenges in which El Chip is present are as follows:

Pay Attention 1
Pay Attention 2
Chaos 1
Chaos 2
Chaos 3Funtime Chica 
Funtime Chica returns as one of the many selectable characters in Ultimate Custom Night. 
Funtime Chica will randomly appear on the player's screen and distract them by disorienting the screen and make camera flashing effects. The player has to deal with it as Funtime Chica can't be avoided.
The challenges in which Funtime Chica appears are as follows:

Pay Attention 1
Pay Attention 2
Ladies Night 1
Ladies Night 2
Ladies Night 3
Chaos 1
Chaos 2Molten Freddy 
Molten Freddy returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 
Like a few other animatronics, Molten Freddy climbs in the vent system but is much faster than the other animatronics when it comes to maneuvering his way towards the office. The player can track him on the vent monitor and can hear his laugh when he is poised to attack. When heard, the player must close the vent door to stop him.
Failure to do so will result in Molten Freddy jumpscaring the player, thus ending their night.
The challenges in which Molten Freddy is present are as follows:

Bears Attack 1
Bears Attack 2
Bears Attack 3
Creepy Crawlies 1
Creepy Crawlies 2
Nightmares AttackScrap Baby 
Scrap Baby with her pre-reincarnation made a return in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the many selectable characters. 
Once per night, she will appear on the other side of the desk, slouched over and decommissioned. There will be a shock panel sitting next to her. The player can shock her at any time by clicking on this button, but it will drain 1% of your power each time you do so, and it will have no effect until she attacks. The player must refrain from pushing the button until you notice that she has moved. Shocking her at this stage will cause her to leave their office and not return. If the player fails to notice that she has moved and brings up their monitor again, she'll jumpscare the player resulting in a game over.
The challenges in which Scrap Baby is present are as follows:

Ladies Night 1
Ladies Night 2
Ladies Night 3
Nightmares Attack
Chaos 2Afton(also referred to as Scraptrap) 
Scraptrap, with his pre-reincarnation, made a return in Ultimate Custom Night. 
William Afton will only attack once per night, and there will be no way of knowing in advance when this attack will happen, or if it will happen at all. He will always attack from the vent on the right wall, and when he does, there will be a violent clamoring sound in the vent and the lights will flicker. When this happens, the player will have only a fraction of a second to close the vent door or the run will end with Afton screaming in the player's face.
The challenges in which Afton is present are as follows:

Pay Attention 1
Pay Attention 2
Creepy Crawlies 2
Springtrapped
Chaos 1
Chaos 2Lefty 
Lefty returns as one of the many selectable characters in Ultimate Custom Night. 
Lefty sits in the closet off of the left hallway (CAM 03). He becomes more and more agitated if the office becomes too noisy or too hot. This state of agitation increases slowly, and will eventually end with Lefty jumpscaring the player. Lowering the noise won't reverse the effects, nor will reducing the temperature, and doors won't prevent Lefty from getting to the player.
The only way to ease his temperament is to switch on the Global Music Box (which soothes all music box animatronics at the expense of extra power being drained). Alternatively, Lefty can be removed from the night entirely if the player uses the Death Coin on him.
The challenges in which Lefty is present are as follows:

Bears Attack 1
Bears Attack 2
Bears Attack 3
Nightmares Attack
Springtrapped
Chaos 3Phone Guy
Phone Guy returns as one of the many selectable characters in Ultimate Custom Night.
Phone Guy will randomly call the player in the night. Then the player has to click the mute call button to stop him. If the player doesn't click the mute call button in time, the player with being forced to listen to one of the calls from FNaF 1, FNaF 2, or FNaF 3, irritating the sound-sensitive animatronics. The mute call button will appear in random places.
Secret Characters
DeeDee/X.O.R. can spawn secret characters. These characters are: 
Shadow Bonnie, Plush Trap, Nightmare Chica, Bonnet, Minireenas, and Lolbit,
DeeDee
Dee Dee, abbreviated as DD, is a character hailing from FNaF World and is an antagonist in Ultimate Custom Night.
Dee Dee will sometimes appear in the Office and sing a song to the player. After finishing her song, she may increase an animatronic's difficulty, summon a random customizable animatronic character at a random difficulty, or do nothing at all. She is also able to summon the characters listed below who are not on the main character customization menu:

Shadow Bonnie
Plushtrap
Nightmare Chica
Bonnet
Minireena
LolbitThe only way of preventing her from appearing during gameplay is enabling the "DD Repel" power-up. This should keep her from numbering the amount of distractions and difficulties.
On 50/20 mode, Dee Dee will be replaced by a darker, ghostly version of herself as X.O.R. (commonly referred to as Shadow Dee Dee). She appears with empty eye-sockets and colored in monochrome (except the button top of her propeller which is now red). She appears out of thin air and will move from side to side within the Office in a rapid, glitching speed accompanied with deep garbling noises. After vanishing, all of Dee Dee's summons will appear one at a time in a fixed order (going from Shadow Bonnie, Plushtrap, Nightmare Chica, Bonnet, the Minireenas and finally Lolbit). She is completely resistant to the "DD Repel" power-up, meaning 50/20 mode must be completed with all of Dee Dee's summons as well. This version of Dee Dee can also appear in normal modes, though this happens very rarely.
RWQFSFASXC (commonly referred to as Shadow Bonnie)
Shadow Bonnie finally makes a return in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the several non-selectable characters summoned by Dee Dee.
After being summoned by Dee Dee, he will appear in the Office and make the entire Office go black for about 10 seconds, with any animatronics from the Office still visible, however. This makes the player unable to see the doors or vent doors, forcing them to keep on track of what is open and closed through other means.
Plushtrap 
Plushtrap returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the several non-selectable characters. He can be only added to the roster by Dee Dee.
After being summoned by Dee Dee, Plushtrap's chair will appear on CAM06 next to the Pirate Cove where Funtime Foxy is. If Plushtrap is seen sitting on the chair, the player must watch him for three seconds to make him run away. Failing to do so will cause Plushtrap to jumpscare the player, resulting in a game over.
Nightmare Chica
Nightmare Chica returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the several non-selectable characters summoned by Dee Dee.
Nightmare Chica will only become active if she is selected by Dee Dee. When she becomes active, she will try to chomp down on the player's point of view by showing her sharp teeth closing in on them. To fend her off, the player needs to turn on the Power A/C or the Heater, which will successfully send Nightmare Chica away. If Nightmare Chica fully closes her mouth, she will jumpscare the player and end the night.
Bonnet
Bonnet returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the several non-selectable characters summoned by Dee Dee.
After being summoned by Dee Dee, Bonnet will appear in the Office at the start of the screen's right side, then walking across the screen while giggling. The player is required to click on her nose to make her go away. If Bonnet reaches the end of the left side, she will jumpscare the player resulting in a game over.
Minireena
Minireena returns once more in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the non-selectable characters summoned by Dee Dee.
Once summoned into the night by Dee Dee, the Minireenas will block the player's view, limiting the player's sight and causing more problems. The Minireenas will then disappear after a while, and never return.
Lolbit 
Lolbit returns in Ultimate Custom Night as one of the several non-selectable characters summoned by Dee Dee.
While not necessarily a selectable character as it does not appear on the character selection menu, Lolbit can only be activated by Dee Dee. If activated, the same "PLEASE STAND BY" pop-up message will appear. The player must type L-O-L on their keyboard to get rid of it. Lolbit does not actually take away any control from the player, but Lolbit's beeping noise will attract noise-sensitive animatronics such as Music Man and Lefty and will also block the player's view.
FredBear
FredBear finally appears in Ultimate Custom Night as a non-selectable character. He is the only animatronic who can't be summoned by DeeDee.
Should the player only have Golden Freddy active and set him to 1, get the death coin and use it on him (it doesn't work if DeeDee summoned someone) FredBear will instantly jumpscare the player and end the night.


== Development ==
In February 2018, after the release of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator, Cawthon announced in a Steam post that he would think about gaining help from larger publishers in making future games. In an edited version of the same post, he added that he would be developing an "ultimate custom night”, which, as revealed on his website, would have more than 50 animatronics from the game and all other games in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series attacking the player.


== Reception ==
Rock, Paper, Shotgun deemed the game "an intriguing mess", with PC Gamer calling it "a neat, customisable take on the classic survival horror formula".

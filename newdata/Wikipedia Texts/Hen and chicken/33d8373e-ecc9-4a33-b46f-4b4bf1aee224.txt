Hen and Chickens Shoal Light

The unmanned reef lights of the Florida Keys were erected between 1921 and 1935. As they were marking local hazards, they did not need to be visible for as far as the reef lights that were erected during the 19th century. By the time these lights were erected, older lighthouses were being automated, and these new lights were designed to be automated from the start. The lights resembled the older reef lights in having a skeletal pyramidal upper structure on screw-pile foundations. They all originally had lanterns on their peaks, so that they looked like smaller versions of the older reef lights, but had no keeper's quarters.


== 1921 Design ==
The first two unmanned lights in the Florida Keys, the Molasses Reef Light and the Pacific Reef Light, were built to the same plan in 1921.


=== Molasses Reef Light ===
The Molasses Reef Light is still standing, but the lantern has been removed, and a NOAA automatic weather station now sits at the top of the tower. The tower, which is painted brown, stands in 9 feet (2.7 m) of water.


=== Pacific Reef Light ===
The United States Coast Guard indicates that a lightship was stationed at Pacific Reef starting in 1838. The Pacific Reef Light erected in 1921 is still operational. The lantern has been removed and is on public display in Founder's Park in Islamorada, Florida. The tower is painted white and stands in 7 feet (2.1 m) of water.


== Hen and Chickens Shoal Light ==
The Hen and Chickens Shoal Light was the smallest of these lights, and the only one built as a triangular pyramid. It still exists, serving as a daymark. The lantern has been removed. The tower is painted red and stands in 19 feet (5.8 m) of water.


== 1932 Design ==
A design for a standardized wrought iron structure was developed in 1932 and used for the next four lights. It was a skeletal hexagonal pyramidal tower on a screw-pile foundation.


=== Smith Shoal Light ===
The Smith Shoal Light was one of the two lights to be erected in 1933 using the 1932 design. It stood in 20 feet (6.1 m) of water. The tower was painted white. The tower apparently no longer exists.


=== Tennessee Reef Light ===
The Tennessee Reef Light was one of the two lights to be erected in 1933 using the 1932 design. It stands in 15 feet (4.6 m) of water, and is painted black. It is the only one of the unmanned reef lights in the Florida Keys that still has its lantern.


=== Cosgrove Shoal Light ===
The Cosgrove Shoal Light was one of the two lights to be erected in 1935 using the 1932 design. It stood in 14 feet (4.3 m) of water. The tower was painted red. It apparently no longer exists.


=== Pulaski Shoal Light ===

The Pulaski Shoal Light was one of the two lights to be erected in 1935 using the 1932 design. It stood in 15 feet (4.6 m) of water and was painted black. As of September 2017, the NOAA National Data Buoy Center depicts an active automated weather station at this location, but no light.

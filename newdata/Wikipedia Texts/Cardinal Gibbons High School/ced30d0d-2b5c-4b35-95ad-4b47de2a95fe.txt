== History ==
Cardinal Gibbons was originally called Sacred Heart High School, and was the first Roman Catholic High School in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The school was originally at the Pulaski Cowper mansion, which was later transformed into Sacred Heart Cathedral, the smallest cathedral in the continental United States.  The school was later named "Cathedral Latin High School."  In 1962 a new school building opened on Western Boulevard in Raleigh and the school was renamed "Cardinal Gibbons Memorial High School. " The site was used for an orphanage until the 1950s. Cathedral School still exists as an elementary and middle school which feeds into Cardinal Gibbons High.  The school currently occupies a campus on Edwards Mill Rd. which was completed in 1999. The former school site is the new location for Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral.

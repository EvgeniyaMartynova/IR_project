University College Isle of Man

The University College Isle of Man (UCM; Manx: Colleish Ellan Vannin) is the primary centre for tertiary, vocational education and higher education on the British Crown dependency of the Isle of Man, being located in the Manx capital Douglas.
Founded as the Douglas School of Art on Loch Promenade in November 1880, the college was renamed the School of Technology, Arts and Crafts upon relocation to the Government Building on Lord Street in 1947, with a 1960 rebranding as the College of Further Education and a 1971 move to the present campus on Homefield Road. As of 1 April 2016 the college has been known as University College Isle of Man.UCM offers a range of courses for school leavers and adults returning to education including NVQs, GCSEs, BTECs, City and Guilds, OCR Nationals and A Levels.
UCM also offers a provision of higher education courses including HNCs, HNDs and an MBA. Degree level courses are offered in conjunction with the University of Chester (since 1996)  and formerly Liverpool John Moores University.In addition to academic and vocational qualifications, UCM offers some professional certifications, short courses and introductory programmes of study. The college offers study of the Manx language at most levels.
Just prior to the rebranding of the Isle of Man College as the University College Isle of Man the college's enrollment was stated to be 160 full-time students: according to Ronald Barr, chief executive of the Manx Department of Education and Children: "Our five-year vision is to...reach [enrollment of] 1000 full-time students [which] will be the trigger point for UCM to become a college of an existing university or become a university in its own right."

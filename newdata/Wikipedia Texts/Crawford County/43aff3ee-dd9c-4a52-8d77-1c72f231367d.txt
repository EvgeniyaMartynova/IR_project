=== Early history ===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans.  From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America.  In 1762, after the British defeated France in the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.


=== 19th century ===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the former New France land west of the Mississippi to France, but kept title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, the United States acquired much of the West and most of the land for modern-day Kansas as part of the 828,000-square mile Louisiana Purchase, at a cost of 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, and in 1861 Kansas was admitted as the 34th U.S. state. The preceding years had been filled with violence as settlers arrived on both sides of the slavery question; the residents voting for Kansas to enter as a free state were the majority. In 1867, Crawford County was established (formed from Bourbon and Cherokeecounties). It is named for Samuel J. Crawford, who was the governor in office at the time.


=== 20th century ===
In the early 20th century, Crawford County was often referred to as the "Little Balkans", because of the many immigrants who came here from that area of Europe. They came to work in the mines, industrial work that did not require much English in the beginning. This area was the site of a number of illegal bootlegging operations, most of which were organized by immigrants in order to supplement their meager earnings as strip miners. During his term, Governor Walter R. Stubbs of Kansas made it his mission to stamp out this practice. According to the criminal justice scholar Ken Peak, "The [Little] Balkans drove [Stubbs] absolutely nuts. He had his hands full and sent people down to the Balkans to clean it up". Despite this crack down, however, the governor was unable to eradicate the crime completely from the area.


=== 21st century ===
On Sunday, May 4, 2003, a violent F4 tornado touched down in western Crawford County, several miles west of Frontenac at around 4:40 p.m.  The tornado remained on the ground throughout Crawford County until it entered neighboring Barton County, Missouri—traveling a total of 35 miles (56 km) and ending near Liberal, Missouri.  The towns of Ringo, Franklin, and Mulberry, all in Crawford County, were devastated.  The tornado cut a path of destruction roughly one quarter mile wide.  Several F4 and F5 tornadoes hit Kansas, Missouri, and several other states that day, including the Kansas City metropolitan area.  Six deaths were reported in Kansas, and Governor Sebelius declared much of eastern and southeastern Kansas a disaster area, including Crawford County.

== Government ==


=== Presidential elections ===

Unlike most of the counties in the Ozark-Ouachita “Bible Belt”, Crawford County remained competitive in Presidential elections until the 2010s. As recently as 2008 it was carried by Barack Obama, being the only county he ever won between the urban limits of Dallas, Little Rock, Denver and Kansas City. However, like all of the region it has shown a strong anti-Democratic trend in recent years, with Hillary Clinton’s 34.9 percent – though more than she achieved in any rural white southern county – being the worst by a Democrat for 92 years. Democrat Laura Kelly won this county in the 2018 gubernatorial election.
In earlier times, Crawford County was a hotbed of left-wing politics, being the nation’s second best county for Eugene Debs in 1912, and one of four where he gained a plurality of votes. It was also Robert La Follette, Sr.’s second-best Kansas county in 1924, behind only largely Catholic Ellis County.
Only three presidential elections from 1948 to the present day have seen Crawford County not back the national winner: 1960, 1988, & 2012.


=== Laws ===
Crawford County was a prohibition, or "dry", county until the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 and voters approved the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with a 30% food sales requirement.  The food sales requirement was removed with voter approval in 1992.

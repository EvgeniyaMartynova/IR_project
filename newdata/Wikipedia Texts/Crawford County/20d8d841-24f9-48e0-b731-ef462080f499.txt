Crawford County, Michigan

Crawford County is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2010 census, the population was 14,074.  The county seat is Grayling.


== History ==

The county is named for Col. William Crawford, a Revolutionary War soldier killed in 1782 while fighting Native Americans in Ohio.  It was created by the Michigan Legislature in 1840 as Shawono County, then renamed Crawford County in 1843.  The county was administered by a succession of other Michigan counties prior to the organization of county government in 1879.


== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 563 square miles (1,460 km2), of which 556 square miles (1,440 km2) is land and 7.0 square miles (18 km2) (1.2%) is water. The county is part of Northern Michigan.
The County is part of the Au Sable State Forest, specifically the Grayling FMU (Alcona, Crawford, Oscoda, and northern Iosco counties). Glaciers shaped the area, creating a unique regional ecosystem.  A large portion of the area is the so-called Grayling outwash plain, which consists of broad outwash plain including sandy ice-disintegration ridges; jack pine barrens, some white pine-red pine forest, and northern hardwood forest. Large lakes were created by glacial action.

participates with the state in the provision of welfare and other social services. The county
board of commissioners controls the budget but has only limited authority to make laws or ordinances.  In

maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

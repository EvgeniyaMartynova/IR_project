== History ==
The roots of Kanazawa University can be traced to 1862 when the Kaga Domain established Hikoso Vaccination Center (彦三種痘所, Hikoso shutōsho). Ishikawa Normal School (石川師範学校, Ishikawa shihan gakkō), Kanazawa Higher Normal School (金沢高等師範学校, Kanazawa kōtō shihan gakkō), Ishikawa Youth Normal School (石川青年師範学校, Ishikawa seinen shihan gakkō), Kanazawa Medical School (金沢医科大学, Kanazawa ika daigaku), Kanazawa Technical College (金沢工業専門学校, Kanazawa kōgyō senmon gakkō), and the Fourth Higher School (第四高等学校, Daishi kōtō gakkō) were integrated in May 1949 to form Kanazawa University.
Since then, Kanazawa University has been the leader of universities on the Sea of Japan. It has continuously and substantially contributed to the development of higher education in Japan as well as global promotion of research by offering undergraduate and graduate courses.

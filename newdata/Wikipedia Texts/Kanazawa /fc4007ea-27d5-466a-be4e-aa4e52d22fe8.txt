== Station layout ==


=== JR platforms ===
JR Kanazawa Station is elevated above street level, featuring three island platforms with one cut-out platform (for Track 4) on the Up (Toyama) side of the middle island platform, serving seven tracks in total. A large roof covers the station building, in order to prevent train stoppages due to accumulated snow within the station.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen platforms are adjacent to the east exit, between the Motenashi Dome and the conventional tracks. The shinkansen station has two island platforms serving four tracks. At the time of its opening, it will be the terminus of the line, although, long-term plans call for the route to be extended first to Tsuruga, and eventually to Osaka.

The departure melody used on the Hokuriku Shinkansen platforms was composed by songwriter and producer Yasutaka Nakata, who was born in Kanazawa.


=== Hokutetsu platforms ===
The platforms for the Hokutetsu Asanogawa Line are located underground, below the JR West platforms.

== History ==
The station opened on 1 April 1898. With the privatization of JNR on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR West.From 14 March 2015, with the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen extension from Nagano, local passenger operations over sections of the Hokuriku Main Line running roughly parallel to the new shinkansen line were reassigned to different third-sector railway operating companies. From this date, Kanazawa Station will become the western terminus of the IR Ishikawa Railway Line of Ishikawa Prefecture.


== Passenger statistics ==
In fiscal 2016, the JR West portion of the station was used by an average of 22,668 passengers daily (boarding passengers only).

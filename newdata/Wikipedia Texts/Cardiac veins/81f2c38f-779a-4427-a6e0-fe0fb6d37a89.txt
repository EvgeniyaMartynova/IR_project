Small cardiac vein

The small cardiac vein runs in the coronary sulcus between the right atrium and ventricle and opens into the right extremity of the coronary sinus.
It receives blood from the posterior portion of the right atrium and ventricle.
It may drain to the coronary sinus, right atrium, middle cardiac vein, or be absent.

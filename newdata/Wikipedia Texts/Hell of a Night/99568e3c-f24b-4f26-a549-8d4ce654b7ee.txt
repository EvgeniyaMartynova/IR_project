== Critical reception ==
"Hell of a Night" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated, "Hell of a Night" "features some of Schoolboy Q's slinkiest rhymes about fast-living and hypnotizing women. With an spooky harmony floating in the background and a drum machine snapping Q's syllables shut, "Hell Of A Night" is the album's non-single with the most potential to become a hit." Maya Kalev writing for Fact said the song, "is a twisted banger, but the predicted drop never materialises, and the effect is weirdly disorienting as Q’s rapid-fire raps cut through oohing vocal samples." Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media said the song, "showcases a trap-house hybrid from DJ Dahi and Q cuts loose, partying hard because he’s lived hard enough to deserve it" Julia Leconte of Now praised JayFrance and DJ Dahi's production. Nathan S of DJBooth said, "you’ll levy some criticism at "Hell of a Night", although there’s some real grit in the verses surrounding that club anthem hook and bridge."Brandon Soderberg of Spin said, the song was "a party track begging for a Zedd remix that flirts with EDM histrionics, but perversely denies us the true dance-floor climax it suggests." Andrew Spragg of The Quietus stated that the song was forgettable. Aziz of Sputnikmusic said the song "exudes gleaming catchiness – the ad-libbing on its final verse makes it one of the most enjoyable on the album – its hook is unbearably corny." Joe Sweeney of Slant Magazine called the song a "languid dance-crossover" that drags the album down. Omar Burgess of HipHopDX referred to the song as album filler. Sam Kriss of TheLineOfBestFit said, ""Hell of a Night" is a perfectly acceptable trap banger, full of richly throbbing bass and slick hi-hat rolls, but it’s a sadly formulaic break from the more compelling stuff elsewhere" on the album.

== Critical reception ==
Giving it a "C", Jon Freeman of Country Weekly wrote that "Dustin Lynch offers this unnecessarily heavy and dirge-like song about having a good time that sounds more like the soundtrack to an angst-ridden teenager's lonely Friday night of video games and Mountain Dew. It also awkwardly equates a minor-key melody and hard guitar stabs with 'sexy'," while adding that the production had "interesting guitar effects" and that Lynch "pushes himself vocally."

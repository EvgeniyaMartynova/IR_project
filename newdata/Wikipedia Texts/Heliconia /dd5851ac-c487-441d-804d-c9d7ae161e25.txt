Comocritis heliconia

Comocritis heliconia is a moth in the family Xyloryctidae. It was described by Meyrick in 1933. It is found on Java.The wingspan is 14â€“21 mm. The forewings are white with a large trapezoidal brownish-ochreous patch occupying the disc from one-fourth to two-thirds, resting on the dorsum and extending three-fourths across the wing, the upper and lower margins broadly suffused grey, the anterior margin with a quadrate grey discal lobe reaching to near the base, a spot of grey suffusion above this towards the costa, the posterior margin biconvex. There is some irregular grey marking on or beneath the costa about two-thirds, a pale ashy-grey fasciate streak irrorated dark grey from beneath the costa at four-fifths to the lower part of the termen, and a pale greyish transverse shade between this and the upper part of the discal patch, the costal edge more or less ochreous on the posterior third. The hindwings are grey, becoming paler or whitish-tinged anteriorly.
The larvae have been recorded feeding on the bark of an unidentified jungle tree.

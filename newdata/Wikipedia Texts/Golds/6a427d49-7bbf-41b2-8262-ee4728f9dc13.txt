Golds World of Judaica

Golds World of Judaica, (known until 1999 as Golds Book and Gift Company), is the Southern Hemisphere's largest Judaica store, as well as being Australia's main importer, wholesaler and retailer of Judaica items. It is owned by Yirmi and Miriam Goldschmiedt, prominent members of Melbourne's Orthodox Jewish community.
The store was opened in November 1987 in a rented building at 36 William Street, off the major Carlisle Street shopping strip in the Balaclava suburb of Melbourne, to service the St Kilda East Jewish community, complementing the Kantor Book Store in High Street, St Kilda, which closed shortly afterward in 1989. Due to that store closing, Golds Book and Gift Company became the largest importer and distributor of Judaica products in Australia. In November 2000, with both the growth of the Melbourne Jewish community and the expanding market of English-language Jewish publications, the store relocated to larger premises at 3 William Street, which includes a carpark and a larger warehouse, as well as changing its name to Golds World of Judaica. The store has also serves as a hub for the community, with tickets to events in all of the various layers of the Melbourne Jewish community being sold there.
The store currently sells much Jewish literature, including the Siddur, Tanakh, Mishnah, Talmud, Halakhic works, as well as works of Jewish philosophy, Hasidut and Kabbalah, both in the original Hebrew version and with English translation, as well as many Jewish-themed non-fiction and fiction books. Also sold are Judaica items, like Kippot, Tzitzit and Tallitot, Tefillin, Mezuzot, and Jewish silverware items like candlesticks and Menorot. It also stocks a range of Jewish music compact disks, Jewish videos and DVDs.

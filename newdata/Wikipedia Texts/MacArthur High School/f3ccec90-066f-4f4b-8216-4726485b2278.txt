== History ==
MacArthur High School was the first high school in the North East Independent School District.  It was established in 1950 as North East Rural High School, but was later renamed after Douglas MacArthur in the 1958-1959 school year after the opening of Robert E. Lee High School.
The campus was composed of separate academic buildings spread out over 37.8 acres until 1999 when the school underwent major construction.  All buildings were demolished, except for the auditorium, cafeteria, and fine arts building, which were renovated.  A new gymnasium was constructed, as well as a new main building, consisting of four wings, each three floors tall, with an open air courtyard in the center.  The combining of the academic buildings allowed for the addition of several new athletic fields. The Track at the school was renovated in the summer of 2008. Additional construction began in 2016 to construct a new Science and Athletics building. In 2018, the Fine Arts building began renovations and expansion. 

The school's athletic and other organizations have seen many successes with district, regional, and state appearances and championships. The school has achieved notable recognition in recent years for its UIL Academic teams, with both teams and individuals placing at the state level in science, current events, and social studies competitions, and a 2007 TMSCA State Championship in science. On a national level, MacArthur physics students have placed consistently in the top 15 in the JETS TEAMS Engineering Competition. The school was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School in 1988-1989.

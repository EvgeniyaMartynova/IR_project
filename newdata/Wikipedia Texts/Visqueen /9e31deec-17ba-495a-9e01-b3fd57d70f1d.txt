== Reception ==
John Bush from Allmusic said that "it had to be questioned whether the band was getting a little too refined for the tastes of its fans", adding that while "the material isn't as powerful as Blood Run, [...] the trio stretches out its sound in spots". Marc Masters from Pitchfork Media said that "the trio's patented sound [...] remains intact, albeit in slicker form. The problem is that this style holds no surprises 18 years after Unsane first coined it."

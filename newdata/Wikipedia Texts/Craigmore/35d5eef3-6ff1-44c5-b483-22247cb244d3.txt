European settlement in the area began in 1855 when Blair Farm was constructed situated just north of what is now Uley Road . Modern development of Craigmore started circa the late 1960s/ early 1970s with the construction of State Housing Trust estates. During 1975, the south eastern part of what is now Craigmore was built as a private development named Blair Park. Further private developments occurred during the mid-1980s, late 1990s, and throughout the 2000, with urban infill still incomplete. This development has made Craigmore one of Adelaide's longest suburbs by distance, totalling 3.75 kilometres parallel with Adams Road between Kakuna Crescent and Arthur Street.

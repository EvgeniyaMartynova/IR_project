Buckskin Mountains (Arizona-Utah)

The Buckskin Mountains on the Arizona-Utah border, is about a 15-mile (24 km)  long mountain range divided almost equally in the counties of Coconino County, Arizona, and Kane County, Utah.
The range lies at the north end of the Kaibab Plateau, of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon; the Kanab and Paria Plateaus of Arizona, lie southwest, and southeast.
The Buckskin Mountains border the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument of Arizona, southeast. The north portion of the range in Utah is located in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.
The northeast range terminus is Buckskin Gulch. To the range's east, across the narrow Coyote Valley of the north-flowing Coyote Wash, lies the Coyote Buttes of Arizona.

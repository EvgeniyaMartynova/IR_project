Turkey Point Park

Turkey Point Park is located in Essex, Maryland, United States, an eastern suburb of Baltimore. The park sits on roughly 32 acres on the scenic Turkey Point Peninsula in Baltimore County. 
It has no relation with Turkey Point, Ontario, Canada. The park was an inspiration for the Turkey Point used by greasers (Drapes) in the 1990 movie Cry-Baby. Turkey Point Park is less than 2 acres (8,100 m2) in size and is surrounded by water. There are walking trails through the woods, but there are no facilities at the park and it is locked at dusk due to safety concerns. ATV or vehicle use within the confines of the park is prohibited.

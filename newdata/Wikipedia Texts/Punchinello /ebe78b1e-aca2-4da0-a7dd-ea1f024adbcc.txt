Max Lucado

Max Lucado (born January 11, 1955) is a best-selling Christian author and pastor at Oak Hills Church (formerly the Oak Hills Church of Christ) in San Antonio, Texas.


== Life ==
Lucado was born in San Angelo, Texas, the youngest of four children to Jack and Thelma Lucado. He grew up in Andrews, Texas. His father was an oil field worker, while his mother served as a nurse.Lucado attended Abilene Christian University where he received an undergraduate degree in Mass Communication. While a student at Abilene Christian, Lucado worked to pay his way through college by selling books door-to-door with the Southwestern Advantage entrepreneurial program. Initially he wished to become a lawyer, but has said that a required Bible course at the university and a mission trip made him change his mind, deciding instead to become a missionary. However, this required that Lucado get a graduate degree in Bible and Biblical Studies; and, have at least two years experience ministering to a church. Lucado graduated from Abilene Christian University with a master's degree in Bible and Biblical Studies.
After graduation, Lucado became an associate minister at Central Church of Christ in Miami, Florida. His responsibilities initially included overseeing a singles' group and writing a column for the church's newsletter. After two years in Miami, the now newlywed Lucado and his wife, Denalyn Lucado, moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to become full-time missionaries. In 1987, Lucado's father died from Lou Gehrig's disease. After five years in Brazil, he brought his family back to the United States to be closer to his mother.
Max and his wife appeared on Fixer Upper (S4 E18 which aired 08/31/2017) when his daughter Sara and her husband Jeff Jones purchased a home that was to be remodeled by Chip & Joanna Gaines. Max asked that a quote that he had written for his daughter’s wedding when he officiated be incorporated in some way into the new home without the couple knowing ahead of time. The quote was “Would you take these two of dust and bone, born of flesh, then would you make them one? Would you speak again the words you spoke when Adam slept and Eve Awoke? Would you let your wine replace our water and look with grace on this son, this daughter? Oh Lord of Eden in your majesty create again your tapestry. One heart where there were two. This is the prayer we lift to you.” Joanna asked Clayton Thompson to make the wall art and it was placed in the "moffice" (the mudroom and office combined).


== Oak Hills Church ==
In 1988, he was hired as a minister to the Oak Hills Church of Christ in San Antonio, Texas. He stopped taking a salary from the church in 1990, because he was already an established successful author.
During his tenure, Oak Hills began using musical instruments in worship services and held the belief that baptism isn't required for salvation (two key doctrines of the Churches of Christ); ultimately Oak Hills dropped its affiliation with them in 2003, calling itself simply "Oak Hills Church".After serving as the senior minister at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, TX for 20 years, Lucado announced in early 2007 that he was stepping down due to health concerns related to atrial fibrillation. Lucado has since resumed the more limited ministry role of writing and preaching at Oak Hills with co-pastor Randy Frazee, formerly of Willow Creek Community Church of South Barrington, Illinois.


== Accomplishments ==
Lucado has written almost 100 books  with 130 million copies in print. He was recipient of the Charles "Kip" Jordon Gold Medallion Christian Book of the Year award three times for his books Just Like Jesus, In the Grip of Grace and When God Whispers Your Name), and has also appeared regularly on several bestseller lists including the New York Times Best Seller List.Lucado was named "America's Pastor" by Christianity Today magazine and in 2005 was named by Reader's Digest as "The Best Preacher in America." He has also been featured on The Fox News Channel, NBC Nightly News, Larry King Live, LLBN, and USA Today.  He has been a featured speaker at the National Prayer Breakfast.

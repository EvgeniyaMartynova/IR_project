Pure McCartney (Paul McCartney album)

Pure McCartney is the fourth compilation album by Paul McCartney. The album was released on 10 June 2016.


== Background ==
The album was first teased in late March 2016 by cryptic video posts placed on McCartney's Facebook and Twitter pages. He also says: There are no cover versions, which may be in line with the "pure" concept.
When the album was announced by McCartney on 31 March 2016, he downplayed the use of "career" in describing the collection, rather referring to it as representative of a "musical adventure." He also noted he and his team compiled the tracks for the alternate track listings "with nothing else in mind other than having something fun to listen to" in different settings.The album features tracks from all of his official studio albums with the exception of CHOBA B CCCP, Flowers in the Dirt, Run Devil Run and Driving Rain.


== Critical reception ==
Pablo Gorondi from ABC News says: "Still, Pure McCartney is a substantial, honest and gratifying introduction to the long and winding career of a pop music giant, a tasting menu whetting the appetite for more."


== Track listing ==
Three versions of the album have been released, a two-disc CD of 39 tracks, a four-disc LP of 41 tracks, and a four-disc CD (and deluxe digital edition) of 67 tracks. All songs are written by Paul McCartney, except where noted.

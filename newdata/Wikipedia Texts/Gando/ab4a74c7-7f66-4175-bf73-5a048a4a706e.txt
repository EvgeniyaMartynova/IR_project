Gando Constituency

Wete District is one of the two districts in the North Pemba Region of Tanzania. The name derives from a misspelling of "wet", due to the fact that it's surrounded by a lot of water. The administrative seat is the town of Wete.  As of 2002, Wete District had a population of 102,482.


== Geography ==
Wete District is on Pemba Island and nearby islands in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.  The islands themselves are composed of sedimentary rocks deposited during the Neogene and Quaternary consisting of mostly limestones and sandstones with marls and some shale, as well as unconsolidated sands and clays. The sediments are nearly flat laying producing a gently undulating and rolling plain.

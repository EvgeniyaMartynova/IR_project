He left in 1967, and during that time he also played a large part in the formation of the Universities Central Council on Admissions, serving as chairman between 1961 and 1964. He was a member of the Planning Committee of the Open University from 1967 to 1970.

Reporting in 1968, it found that administrators were not professional enough, and in particular lacked management skills, and included the creation of a Civil Service College as one of its 158 recommendations.
In 1968, Fulton's international work continued as he became chairman of the British Council, serving until 1971.

== Quotations ==
“Although I stick very close to the traditional canvases in my own work, it is my good fortune to be able to get a thrill out of any work of art.  I have seen inspiring beauty in just about every class of art, non-objective, classic, traditional or primitive.”  -John Russell Fulton

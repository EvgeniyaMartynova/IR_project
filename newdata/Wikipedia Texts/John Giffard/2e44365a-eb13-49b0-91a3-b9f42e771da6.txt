John Giffard (judge)

John Giffard  (died after 1396) was an English born-lawyer and cleric   of the late fourteenth  century, who served  for a brief time as Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas.
Little is known of his life  before 1377,  when he appeared in Ireland  as a Crown official. He is known to have travelled through Ireland on official business,  which took him to Ulster in 1383. He was presented to a living  in the diocese of Cloyne in 1382 and to another  living at Church Lawford, Warwickshire in  1386.
He was appointed Chief Justice  of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland)  in 1396 but Elrington Ball tells us  that he was removed from office only a few days later, for unknown reasons.

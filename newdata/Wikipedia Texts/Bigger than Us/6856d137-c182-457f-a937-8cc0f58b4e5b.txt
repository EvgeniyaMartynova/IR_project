== Background ==
Speaking to Newsweek, Groban said that after performing on Broadway in The Great Comet from 2016 to 2017, "I didn't even want a break. I just dove into writing. There are some albums, like the last one, where I don't want to write at all, I just want to be a vocalist. Then there are some where you're pouring out idea after idea. I've had sad albums in the past and I wanted an album that had an uplifting spirit, for my psyche and also for the psyche of listeners. I think we all need that."

Bridges debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with 96,000 album-equivalent units, of which 94,000 were pure album sales, and was kept of the tip.of that chart by the fourth studio album by American hip-hop group Brockhampton, Iridescence.

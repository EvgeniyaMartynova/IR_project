On 18 November 2010 the video premièred on the NME's website.
The video is a homage to Steven Spielberg's 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video recreates elements of E.T.'s apparent death whilst he is quarantined alongside Elliott. The character of E.T. is played by a large "Bigger than Us" candy bar which contains a young girl. Elliot is watched over by Gertie and Mary whilst what may be Greg and Steve wait outside. There are other intertextual references to the film featured in the video, the basketballs circling the band at 2:56, the bright red light within the bass drum at 3:08 and the images of the woods where the original film sees E.T. return home.

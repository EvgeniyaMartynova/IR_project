== Economic Activity ==
Agriculture occupies first place in the economy, since it generates the greatest number of jobs. The Municipality has 32 agricultural fields that are highly developed technically, on which table and juice grapes, peaches, walnuts, and various vegetables and gourds (squash and pumpkins) grow. Most crops are exported to the United States of America.
The principal problem in the public (ejido) sector is that it does not have adequate infrastructure. Also, it does not have access to banking credit.
Ranching is an activity that has become more and more high-tech with good genetic material. The number of cattle has grown to 34,886 head, on 65 properties.
The main problem is the bad roads which access these properties. In the last few years, the amount of buffel grass used to seed pastures has increased by a factor of four. This has considerably increased financial production, and increased ranching activity.
Industrial activity in the Municipality is almost nonexistent. There are only packers of table grapes and squash.
A high priority is the creation of a maquiladora (twin plant) which could generate employment mainly for the women of the Municipality.

Mount Kanaga

Mount Kanaga is a stratovolcano at the northern tip of Kanaga Island in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.  It is situated within a caldera, which forms the arcuate Kanaton Ridge south and east of Kanaga.  A crater lake occupies part of the SE caldera floor. The summit of Kanaga has a crater with fumarolic activity.
It is located about 25 km (16 mi) west of the U.S. Navy installation and port on Adak Island. The volcano erupted intermittently through much of 1994, dusting the community of Adak at least once with fine ash.

With the resurgence of Telangana movement, Gadar expressed his support for the cause of a separate Telangana state and those people who were advocating it with the intention of uplifting the lower castes, particularly dalits and also backward castes. He said he was strongly with those who are for a Telangana of social justice where Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes have political representation on par with the OCs and BCs of the state. He expressed his solidarity with Devendar Gouds NTPP (Nava Telangana Praja Party) in spite of being shot at by the police during Goud's term as AP Home Minister.Gadar's song "Amma Telanganama Akali kekala gaanama" has been selected as the state song of Telangana.

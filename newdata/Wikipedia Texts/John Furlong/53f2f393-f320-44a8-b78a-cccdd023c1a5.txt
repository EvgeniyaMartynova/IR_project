At the conclusion of his teaching term he returned home to Ireland and served as a sports administrator at Newpark Comprehensive School before emigrating to Canada in 1975. He was also president of the Arbutus Club, a member of the Canadian Olympic Committee, and head of the BC Summer Games, BC Winter Games, and Sport B.C.He has cited Canada as being possibly unique in appointing an immigrant to be CEO of their Olympic Games.His performance and leadership in the Canadian Sport community and specifically in the highly successful staging of the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games led to wide recognition such as the Order of Canada and Order of British Columbia as well as numerous honorary degrees and other awards.
After the Games accusations of errors and omissions in his autobiography and abuse allegations were published dating back to his years as a missionary and teacher. Furlong has vehemently denied all of the allegations, none of which has been tested in court.

=== Biographical inaccuracies and omissions ===


==== Patriot Hearts ====
On February 12, 2011, the one-year anniversary of the Olympics, Furlong, with Globe and Mail journalist Gary Mason, published his autobiography Patriot Hearts – Inside the Olympics that Changed a Country.
Furlong wrote in Patriot Hearts that he arrived in Canada in 1974 with his wife and young family. He later admitted the date he arrived as a landed immigrant was not 1974 under cross-examination (Robinson v. Furlong).Furlong wrote that Jack Furlong, his father, identified the body of his niece, Siobhán Roice, after she was killed in the Dublin bombings. Siobhán's family strongly deny this claim, stating her father Edward "Ned" Roice identified her body. Records from the investigation of the bombing list Ned Roice, not Jack Furlong, as attending.Johanna Roice, Siobhán's mother, is misnamed Josephine in Patriot Hearts.Furlong lists May 14, 1974 as the date of the Dublin bombings. In fact, the Dublin bombings occurred on May 17.Furlong wrote that the May 1974 terrorist bombings in Dublin and deaths of his cousin and his father prompted his decision to emigrate shortly thereafter in 1974. However, Furlong returned to Canada over a year following these events, in 1975.Furlong wrote that he had been a "young teacher with just two years' experience" in 1974 when he accepted a job with a Prince George high school. In fact, he accepted the position with Prince George College (in 1975, not 1974) as a teacher with five years' combined experience at Immaculata Catholic School and Prince George College, 1969–72 and Newpark Comprehensive School, circa 1972–75. Furlong wrote that a recruiter visiting Ireland invited him to set up a high school athletic program in Prince George, British Columbia. In fact, Furlong was well known to Prince George College and recruiter Bishop Fergus O’Grady, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Prince George, as the former Frontier Apostle missionary who taught physical education until June 1972.That Furlong's visiting teacher and missionary years in Canada are not included in his book is controversial because the timeline coincides with allegations Furlong abused First Nations children while a missionary teacher at a school in Burns Lake (1969–70). Furlong had been a visiting teacher in Canada from 1969 to 1972 as a Frontier Apostle missionary at schools in Burns Lake and Prince George, British Columbia. In June 1972, Furlong returned to Ireland following threats against his life. Co-author Gary Mason has stated that Furlong never mentioned the visiting teacher years in Canada.Furlong has never discussed his employment at Newpark Comprehensive School in Dublin Ireland (circa 1972–75). During this time, George Gibney, the disgraced former Irish national swim team coach, also managed athletics at the Newpark. In 1976, Furlong told a reporter only that he had managed a government sports centre in Ireland before returning to Canada.


==== Athletic career ====
Biographies associated with his speaking engagements and awards such as the Order of British Columbia state that Furlong was the 1986 Canadian Squash Champion.  In fact, Jamie Hickox won the 1986 title. John Furlong was one of three age group winners. Squash Canada does not recognize Furlong as the 1986 Canadian Squash Champion.In the lead up to 1978 Northern B.C. Winter Games, Furlong claimed he had competed in the Olympics two times. There is no evidence that Furlong appeared as an athlete at any Olympics.
In 1975, Furlong stated he had played internationally for Ireland for eight years. This claim is unsupported by a timeline that finds Furlong away from Ireland from age 18 to 20 years (1969–72) and from age 24 (1975 to the present).


=== Abuse allegations ===
There have been no criminal charges against Furlong and three civil claims were cancelled, yet there continues to be high-profile advocacy by First Nations and others for further investigation.
On September 26, 2012, The Georgia Straight published an article that reported allegations that children in the 1970s were physically and mentally abused while Furlong was a missionary and physical education teacher at Immaculata Catholic School, a residential school, in Burns Lake. The article, by journalist Laura Robinson, was supported by over 45 statements, including eight affidavits. Robinson's response to Furlong's defamation action included additional allegations supported by witness statements that he emotionally, physically, and sexually abused his first wife. A statement from his second wife alleged domestic violence.Abuse allegations against Furlong have never been heard nor accepted as evidence in court. Three former students, who were not part of the Georgia Straight story, alleged that Furlong sexually, physically, and verbally abused them. In 2013, these three former students filed failed civil lawsuits against Furlong, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vancouver, the Roman Catholic Prince George Diocese, and the Catholic Independent Schools Diocese of Prince George.Based on changes in information from interviews by the RCMP with one of the three accusers, a BC Supreme Court Judge incorrectly concluded that the woman had not  attended the school where she had accused Furlong of abuse. In fact, the woman had attended the school during Furlong's tenure according to documents presented at a later trial (Robinson v. Furlong). A second woman dropped her civil case after it was deemed unfounded. The third plaintiff, a man, was found to have already received $120,822 in compensation for a claim while attending a different school at the same period as his claim against Furlong. In fact, this man had attended Immaculata during Furlong's tenure.


=== RCMP ===
Questions have been raised about the relationship between Furlong and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers who investigated abuse allegations against him. Some of these senior officers had worked closely with Furlong on Olympic security holding senior or oversight positions in security for the 2010 games in Vancouver. These relationships were not revealed and these officers did not recuse themselves from the investigation.In a December 2016 complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, six Northern British Columbia First Nations members formally accused the federal government and RCMP of racial and ethnic discrimination in mishandling their allegations that John Furlong abused them.


=== University of British Columbia Fundraiser ===
In January 2017, University of British Columbia (UBC) president Santa J. Ono apologized to Furlong for cancelling his keynote address at the February Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation fundraising event for athletes. Days later, in an apparent response to a strong public reaction against the speech cancellation including alumni who threatened to withhold major donations, Ono announced that UBC had reversed that decision expressing "deep regret" for the impact of cancelling on Furlong. In response to Furlong's reinstatement as speaker, indigenous professor Daniel Heath Justice quit a UBC committee working on a new sexual assault policy. In a letter to Ono, Heath stated the decision to reinstate Furlong "silenced and erased" abuse allegations against Furlong.Furlong spoke at the sold-out UBC fundraising breakfast, which raised several hundred thousand dollars for University athletic programs. He donated his five-figure speaking fee to the fundraising effort.In October 2017, UBC became the subject of a human rights complaint over its handling of Furlong's speech.


=== Ongoing advocacy ===
There has been ongoing advocacy for investigation into the allegations.
In July 2018 in apparent response to Furlong heading Calgary's 2026 bid exploration committee, the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) passed a resolution calling on chiefs to boycott the bid as a show of support for former residential and day school students.In July 2016, the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) passed a resolution to pressure the federal government and the RCMP to formally investigate multiple abuse allegations against Furlong.In January 2016, a complaint to the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) sought to appeal a judge's decision due to incorrect information. CJC dismissed the complaint.In a November 2015 open letter, three First Nations hereditary chiefs and five Furlong accusers called on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to remove John Furlong from Own the Podium pending a hearing of their claims. Furlong left Own the Podium in July 2018.


=== Defamation lawsuits ===
In November 2012, Furlong filed, but later dropped, defamation suits against the Georgia Straight newspaper and journalist Laura Robinson. Robinson's response to Furlong's defamation action included additional allegations of abuse. Robinson's lawyer accused John Furlong of dropping the suit to avoid witnesses. In default judgements, Georgia Straight and Robinson were awarded legal costs.


== Personal life ==

== Plot ==
A supernatural horror/thriller about a desperate hunt for a 200 year old vampire played by Jeremy Palko when he escapes from police custody following being detained for the cold-blooded murder of a paedophile on a New York subway train. The vampire however, is not as ruthless as he seems, killing only within a strict â€œcode of ethics" selecting, trailing, hunting and feeding on bad people that have managed to avoid being caught by the law. The series is aimed at bringing  retro typical vampires back to the screen, with "old school" vampire traits, like exploding when exposed to sunlight rather than sparkling as with some of the recent vampire productions.

John Francis (Australian sportsman)

John Charles "Jack" Francis (22 June 1908 â€“ 6 July 2001) was an Australian sportsman who played first-class cricket for Victoria and Australian rules football with Hawthorn in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Born in Hawthorn and educated at Melbourne High School, Francis began his sporting career in 1926 when he joined the VFL. He played six games for Hawthorn that year, kicking two goals in his debut, against Collingwood, for whom future club great Harry Collier was also debuting. Francis did not continue as a footballer, instead concentrating on cricket, and in the 1932/33 season made his first appearance with Victoria. Opening the batting, Francis scored 135 to help the Victorians draw with Tasmania. He played two further first-class matches, both later in the season and as an opener, but did not make any major contributions for his team. His brothers Jim and Syd also played VFL football.

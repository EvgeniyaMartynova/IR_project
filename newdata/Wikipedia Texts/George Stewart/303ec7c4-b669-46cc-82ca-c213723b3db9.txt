George Wilson Stewart

James Wingfield Golucke (1865â€“1907), often known as J.W. Golucke, was an American architect based in Atlanta, Georgia.He worked alone and also within partnership Golucke & Stewart. On his own he designed about 15 courthouses in Georgia.  With partner George Wilson Stewart (1862-1937) he designed five Georgia courthouses and other buildings such as the Fitzpatrick Hotel.  Little is known about Stewart besides that he practiced by himself after 1900, including acting as an assisting architect for the Candler Building during its 1903-1906 construction in Atlanta.Many of Golucke's works, alone or with partners, are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

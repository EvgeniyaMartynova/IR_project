On her appointment, Hudson commented, "I couldn't be more excited to join the amazing panel of coaches on The Voice UK! The UK has always been so supportive of me since the beginning of my career so I’m really looking forward to sharing my point of view with the contestants and especially Team JHUD. Discovering new artists has always been important to me and the UK has no shortage of talent, so I can only imagine what this experience will be like for everyone involved. I can't wait to get going and start developing each individual’s own sound!"Emma Willis announced that she would return to present the show alone, without her co-host Marvin Humes' involvement. On 8 August 2016, it was announced that a planned ITV2 unnamed spinoff show had been scrapped.

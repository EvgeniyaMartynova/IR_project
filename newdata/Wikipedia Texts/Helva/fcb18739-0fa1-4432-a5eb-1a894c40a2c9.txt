Aebutia (gens)

The gens Aebutia was a Roman family that was prominent during the early Republic.  The gens was originally patrician, but also had plebeian branches.  The first member to obtain the consulship was Titus Aebutius Helva, consul in 499 BC.


== Praenomina ==
During the first century of the Republic, the Aebutii used the praenomina Titus, Lucius, Postumus, and Marcus.  In later times, they also used the name Publius.


== Branches and cognomina ==
The patrician Aebutii used the cognomen Helva (also found as Elva in some sources).  Cornicen was a personal surname belonging to one of the Helvae.  No patrician Aebutius held any curule magistracy from 442 to 176 BC, when Marcus Aebutius Helva obtained the praetorship.  Carus was a cognomen of the plebeian Aebutii.  Later surnames include Faustus, Liberalis, and Pinnius.

S.N.P.J., Pennsylvania

S.N.P.J. is a borough located in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania. According to the 2010 U.S. census, the borough has a population of 19.
S.N.P.J. stands for "Slovenska Narodna Podporna Jednota" (Slovene National Benefit Society), a fraternal society and financial co-operative based in Imperial, Pennsylvania.
The society applied to have their 500-acre (200 ha) recreation center in western Pennsylvania designated as a separate municipality in 1977. The S.N.P.J. borough was created so that the society could, among other things, get its own liquor license. North Beaver Township, the municipality in which the center was originally located, restricted the sale of alcohol on Sundays (blue law).
S.N.P.J. once had the distinction of being the least-populated borough in the state (but not municipality; East Fork Road District, population 14, was less populous) until a mine fire beneath Centralia made that borough unsafe to live in.

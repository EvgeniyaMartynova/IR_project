Alexander of Rome

Alexander of Rome (died 289) is a Christian martyr. The date of his birth is unknown. He died in 289 AD and his mother Pimenia buried him near the river Ergina. His mother was a witness of his martyrdom. Alexander was a Roman soldier and he was  serving in the regiment of the tribune Tiberian at Rome. During this period, the Roman emperor Maximian Hercules issued an edict by which all citizens were required to go to the temple of Jupiter to offer sacrifice. Alexander refused to follow this order because of his strong Christian faith. As a result of that, Maximian sent Alexander to Thrace, but Alexander died on the way to this Roman province in 289 AD.

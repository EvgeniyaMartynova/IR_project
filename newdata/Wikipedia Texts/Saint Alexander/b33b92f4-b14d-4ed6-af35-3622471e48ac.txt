Alexander Svirsky

Alexander Svirsky or Alexander of Svir (1448â€“1533) was an Eastern Orthodox saint, monk and hegumen of Russian Orthodox Church.Amos (his baptismal name) was born to an ordinary peasant family in the Novgorod Republic, east of Ladoga. At the age of 19, he left home for the Valaam Monastery and spent further time of his life as monk, including some period of total isolation from society.
In 1506, Serapion, Archbishop of Novgorod, appointed him Hegumen of the Trinity monastery, which later became known as Alexander-Svirsky Monastery, at the place of the saint's eremitic life between Roschinsky and Holy lakes, 20 km to the east from Lake Ladoga and 6 km from the Svir River.The saint became known for his righteous life and contemplative miracles, including the appearances of the Trinity and of Mother Mary with the Holy Child. His day is commemorated on April 17 and August 30 according to Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar.
The relics of the saint were found on April 17 (27), 1641. According to the Vita of the saint, the relics were found incorruptible.
On October 22, 1918, the coffin with the relics of Alexander Svirsky was opened. In a cast reliquary weighing over 40 pounds of silver, instead of the imperishable relics of Alexander Svirsky, a wax doll was claimed according to the Soviet reports.. The testimony of the monks present, as well as a later soviet commission under the direction of Grigory Zinoviev, demonstrated that they found a human body instead of a wax figure.

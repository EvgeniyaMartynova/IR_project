The music video for "Black Out the Sun" premiered on Hayes' official YouTube channel on 21 August 2011, at a total length of four minutes and fifteen seconds. The video features Hayes on a deserted beach surrounded by cloaked figures. It was shot at a sound stage at Village Roadshow studios in Queensland, using vintage anamorphic lenses from the '70s. Arjanwrites said of the video, The new video for "Black Out the Sun" is a perfect match for the atmospheric quality of the pop ballad. Standing on a deserted beach and surrounded by grim reapers, Hayes seems isolated, lost and confused. The dark and lifeless wasteland pictured in the video is the perfect backdrop for Hayes' state of mind in the song.

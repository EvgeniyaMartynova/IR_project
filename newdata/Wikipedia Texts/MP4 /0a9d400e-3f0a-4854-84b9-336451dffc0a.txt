Nintendo announced Metroid Prime 4 in June 2017 during their E3 online showcase, showing only the logo. Shortly after the announcement, Bill Trinen, Director of Product Marketing at Nintendo of America, confirmed that Prime 4 would not be developed by Retro Studios, the studio that developed the previous Metroid Prime games, but would be produced by Kensuke Tanabe, the producer of the previous games. In 2018, Eurogamer confirmed that  Bandai Namco Studios in Singapore was developing Prime 4.On several occasions during 2018, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé stated that Metroid Prime 4 was "well into development" and "proceeding well". However, Nintendo did not show it at E3 2018, and would only share more information once they believed they "had something that would wow people". Fils-Aimé said while Nintendo prefers to reveal information about games six to nine months before release, they had revealed Prime 4 early to assure fans that a game was in development for Switch, similar to their announcement of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.In a video released in January 2019, Nintendo EPD general manager Shinya Takahashi announced that Metroid Prime 4 would be delayed, and that its development had been restarted with Retro Studios. Takahashi said that development under Bandai had not met Nintendo's standards. Nintendo's shares fell by 2.8 percent in the week following the announcement.

== History ==
Bloomberg TV Philippines launches its first-ever primetime news program, The Big Story, which was first aired on October 24, 2016 at 8:45 pm. It continued to run until the local Bloomberg channel relaunched as One News on May 28, 2018 and expanded its airtime, with an earlier timeslot at 8:00 pm.
On March 4, 2019, the program began broadcasting on free TV via One News' sister channel, 5, replacing Aksyon Tonite as a late-night newscast and airs every weeknights at 10:00 PM, (PST). It is the first English-language newscast of the network since Sentro from 2007 to 2008. However, it will be replaced by the delayed telecast of One Balita Pilipinas, produced by sister station One PH beginning September 23, 2019, anchored by former Aksyon Tonite anchor Cheryl Cosim.

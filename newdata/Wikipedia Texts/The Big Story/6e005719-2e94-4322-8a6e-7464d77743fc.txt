The Big Story (talk show)

The Big Story is an American news/talk television program that premiered in 2000 on the Fox News Channel, hosted by John Gibson weekdays. In 2007 Heather Nauert joined him as co-host. The series was put on hiatus in March 2008, replaced with America's Election Headquarters, an hour of news related to the 2008 United States presidential election. Subsequently, Fox News lured Glenn Beck from Headline News in the interim between The Big Story being put on hiatus and the election, which resulted in The Big Story being cancelled; the Big Story timeslot was taken by his Beck's self-titled program on January 19, 2009.
One of the channel's afternoon shows, the program featured coverage of news stories of the day under general banners (ex. "Big Money", "Big Security") introduced after commercial breaks.  The program also featured debate and analysis by pundits and panelists.

A weekend edition of the program, The Big Story Weekend, aired Saturdays and Sundays.  Hosted initially by Rita Cosby, then by Jamie Colby and later by Julie Banderas, the weekend edition featured a segment called "Your Word Live" where viewers could call in and give comments on a topic discussed on the show.

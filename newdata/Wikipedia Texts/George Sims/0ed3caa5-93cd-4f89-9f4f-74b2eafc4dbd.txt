The New York Times described it as “a ceaseless welter of bloodshed and frenzy, a sustained bedlam of killing and fiendishness, told in terse staccato style . . .” Sims wrote a total of 17 stories for Black Mask. He left the magazine when editor Joseph Shaw was fired in 1936. Additionally, Sims had stories published in Detective Fiction Weekly and Star Detective Magazine, and several articles in Gourmet. In 1946, a paperback collection of his best stories called Seven Slayers was published by Saint Enterprises.

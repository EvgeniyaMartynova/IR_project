Wells Fargo Arena (Tempe, Arizona)

Desert Financial Arena  (formerly ASU Activity Center and Wells Fargo Arena) is a 14,000-seat multi-purpose arena located at 600 E Veterans Way in Tempe, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix.
Constructed in the spring of 1974 as the ASU Activity Center and at the cost of $8 million, it is the home of multiple Arizona State University athletic teams, to include men's basketball, women's basketball, women's volleyball, women's gymnastics, and men's wrestling. The facility also plays host to graduation ceremonies and a variety of concerts and shows. The building replaced Sun Devil Gym as the primary arena for the Sun Devils' basketball team.

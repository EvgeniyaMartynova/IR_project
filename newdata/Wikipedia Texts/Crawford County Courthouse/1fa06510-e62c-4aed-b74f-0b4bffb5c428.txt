Crawford County Courthouse (Wisconsin)

The Crawford County Courthouse is located in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.


== History ==
The courthouse was built with dolomitic limestone quarried in Bridgeport, Wisconsin. The basement was originally a jail that likely predated the rest of the building. It was used as such until 1896, when a separate building was completed. The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and on the State Register of Historic Places in 1989.

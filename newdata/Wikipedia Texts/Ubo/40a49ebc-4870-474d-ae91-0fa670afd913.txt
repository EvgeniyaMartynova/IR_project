Daram, Samar

Daram, officially the Municipality of Daram,  is a 3rd class municipality in the province of Samar, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 42,879 people.


== Etymology ==
The origin of the name Daram is from a type of bird, called Darangsiyao, that guided the initial settlers to the island. Some time later, a Spaniard inquiring about the name of the island, mistook the name for "Daramsiyao". This was further shortened to the current name of Daram. The original name of Daramsiyao is still in use as the name of the annual festival held in Poblacion 1 on January 15.


== History ==
The Island was originally part of the municipality of Zumarraga, Samar, and mostly inhabited by a few fisher-folk and travelers from other places whose primary source of income was fishing and farming.
As the years passed Daram began to grow in population and economic activities through settlers and travelers who constructed dwelling units sporadically along the coastlines of the islands.


=== Separation from Zumarraga ===
On 1 September 1949, President Elpidio Quirino signed Executive Order No. 262. This order ceded the islands of Daram and Parasan from the Municipality of Zumarraga and created the independent Municipality of Daram, with barrio (now barangay) Daram as the municipal seat. It must be noted that on the current list of barangay for the Municipality of Daram, there is no barangay named Daram. 


== Geography ==
Daram has a total land area of 14,026 hectares (34,659 acres). The province is composed of two major islands; Daram Island and Parasan Island. Other islands include Poro Island and Danaodanauan Island (uninhabited).
The main island features mountainous interiors with very narrow coastal areas. Mountain ranges occupy the major portion of the island municipality.
Daram has a combination of warm and cool climatic zones, thus the prevailing climate is ideal for the cultivation of a wide range of agricultural crops. There is no distinct dry season but the heavy wet season generally occurs in December.
Daram lies within the western part of Samar Sea and the Zumarraga Channel. The north and western boundary is the Samar Sea; the eastern boundary is the Zumarraga Channel; the southern boundary is Daram Channel.
It can be reached by a 30-minute boat ride from the provincial capital of Catbalogan City and Northern Leyte.


== Government ==
Like all other Municipalities in the Philippines, Daram is governed from the Municipal Hall by a Mayor and the Sangguniang Panlungsod which is composed of the City (Municipality) Vice Mayor as Presiding Officer, regular Sanggunian members (Councilors), the President of the Daram Chapter of the League of Barangays of the Philippines and the President of the Daram Chapter of the Sangguniang Kabataan (Student Leaders). These elected officials are entitled to three-year terms.
These political leaders exercise and perform the legislative powers and duties as provided for under Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991. They are empowered to consider and conduct thorough study all matters brought to their attention and consequently pass resolutions, enact ordinances and introduce recommendations.

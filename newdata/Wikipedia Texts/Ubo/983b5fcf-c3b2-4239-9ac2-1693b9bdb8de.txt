Vambi

The Vambi (also called an Ubo or Kissumbo) is a string instrument traditional in Sudan and in other East African countries. Mostly used as accompaniment for singers.
Vambis look like giant violins. Their case is made of wood or tried pumpkin, which is covered with a wooden soundboard. On one end, strings are attached to cane pegs in the lower portion of the case, while on the other end they are connected to flexible bamboo cores.

WHAK-FM

WHAK-FM (99.9 FM, "The Wave") is a radio station licensed to Rogers City, Michigan. The station serves the Alpena and Cheboygan areas with a classic hits music format featuring hits of the 1970s and 1980s.  The station has a local weekday-morning show and airs Westwood One's Classic Hits/Pop format the remainder of the time.
Prior to April 1999, the station broadcast a satellite-fed country format as "Eagle 100" (with the call sign WELG from 1994 to 1997).  The move to the oldies format helped to fill a void in the Northeast Michigan radio scene left when 92.5 WAIR (now WFDX) switched from oldies to country music.
WHAK-FM is owned by Edwards Communications along with WHSB-FM 107.7 in Alpena, and WWTH-FM 100.7 in Oscoda. Sister station WHAK-AM 960 is leased to Michigan Broadcasters, LLC and is a simulcast of WYPV of Mackinaw City.
AM 960 WHAK was a longtime full service adult contemporary/MOR station serving Rogers City and Presque Isle County.  By 1999, the station was airing a mostly automated gold-based country format, still as a standalone.  WHAK went off the air in November 2000 and returned almost a year later with talk programming, mainly from the Michigan Talk Radio Network, dubbing itself "Your Information Source in the North." This continued until the station became a simulcast of the new "Thunder Country" WWTH Oscoda in April 2005.  In the summer of 2012, WHAK-AM was noted simulcasting WHAK-FM rather than WWTH.
The WHAK calls stand for the station's original owner, Harvey A. Klann.  Klann is a lifelong resident of Rogers City and World War 2 veteran.

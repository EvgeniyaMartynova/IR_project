Hello, Dolly! is a 1964 (see 1964 in music) studio album by the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald.
"Hello, Dolly!," "People," "Can't Buy Me Love," and "The Sweetest Sounds" were recorded in London, England, on April 7.  The other eight tracks were recorded in New York City on March 3 and March 4.  Three songs recorded at the latter sessions remain unreleased: "There! I've Said It Again," "I'll See You in My Dreams," and "There Are Such Things."

Her version of the Beatles song "Can't Buy Me Love" was a minor hit single in 1964, peaking at #34 in the UK singles chart.

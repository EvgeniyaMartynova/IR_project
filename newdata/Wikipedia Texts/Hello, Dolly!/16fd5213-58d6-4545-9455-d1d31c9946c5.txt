Hello, Dolly! (soundtrack)

Hello, Dolly! is the soundtrack album to the 1969 musical film of the same name, performed by Barbra Streisand, Walter Matthau, and Michael Crawford. Originally released on vinyl by 20th Century Fox Records, the soundtrack was remastered for compact disc release by Philips Records in 1994.  This album marked the second time Streisand recorded for a label other than Columbia (the previous instance being the Original Broadway Cast recording of Funny Girl five years earlier).

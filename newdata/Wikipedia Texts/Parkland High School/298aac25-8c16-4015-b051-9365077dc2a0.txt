Parkland High School (Pennsylvania)

Parkland High School is a public high school located in South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania. The school serves students in grades 9-12 and is the only high school for the Parkland School District.


== History ==
Parkland High School was formed in 1949 when North Whitehall Township and South Whitehall Township merged to create Parkland Union School District, with Upper Macungie Township joining in 1950. Its predecessor, South Whitehall High School, was housed in the current-day Troxell Building. Parkland used the same facility until a larger building on Route 309 in Orefield was completed in 1954, which served as the high school for 45 years. In 1999, the new and current Parkland High School building on Cedar Crest Boulevard in Allentown was opened due to overcapacity of the second building. The old school was renovated and renamed Orefield Middle School, replacing Troxell Junior High School. When viewed from above, the layout of the current building and grounds closely approximate the shape of the Millennium Falcon, a spacecraft featured in the Star Wars films.  School officials claim that the design was not deliberate.

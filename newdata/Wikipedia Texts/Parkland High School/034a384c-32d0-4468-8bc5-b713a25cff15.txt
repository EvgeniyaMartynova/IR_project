== History ==


=== Grammar school ===
The current Parklands High School was originally called Chorley Grammar School. It was originally housed in buildings in Union Street, Chorley which is now home to the public library. It changed its name in 1972, when the school changed from a grammar school to a comprehensive school, to Parklands High School.
From 2003 to 2012, Parklands High School held a specialist language college status. Since 1962, the school badge reads Propositi Tenax, which translates to Firm of Purpose. The current motto if the school is Learn, Respect, Aspire, Achieve, which has been used since the school became an academy.
The school introduced a house system in 2012, which introduced the vertical tutoring system. There are five houses in the school; Asia, South America, Australasia, Europe and Africa. There are 8 different countries in each house. Each form in Parklands represents a country in their house. This system replaced the traditional form groups in 2012.


=== Buildings ===
The current school buildings were opened in 1959. This included the hall, concourse, south and north blocks and the gym. Several buildings have been erected since the school was first built. This includes the west block, which was built in 1970s, and is currently used as history, music and ICT classrooms.
The first major building work was the extension of the north block, which added four more English classrooms and two photography rooms, which are currently named as N01, N02, N14, N15, N24 and N25. This addition was constructed when Mr. Ray Landless was the headteacher of the school. The Science Blocks (L1/L2) were constructed in 1989.
There were two major building additions in the 2000s, a new art, RE, drama, and science block which replaced the previous block ROSLA, which was demolished, a new sports hall, and in 2010, an extension to the front of the building, to extend the dining area and reception. In addition students created a new outdoor social area.
Parklands was first made a Language College in 2003. In 2014, the Parklands Pavilion was opened after months of refurbishment. This building is currently used as dance studios, and is also used for assemblies.


=== Academy ===
Parklands High School converted to academy status in September 2012, meaning the school is now independent of local authority control.

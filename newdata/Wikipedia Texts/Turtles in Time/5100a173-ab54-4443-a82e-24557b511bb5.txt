Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) (season 10)

The tenth season of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was the final season of the series. Shredder and Krang return for three episodes, and the Technodrome is still in Dimension X.
When the season aired, the interest for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had almost faded out. At the time, CBS was phasing out its Saturday morning cartoon block and the 10th season is practically a miniseries.

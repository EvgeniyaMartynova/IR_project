SunTrap

SunTrap is a British television sitcom produced by Happy Tramp Productions for the BBC. The series was created and written by Neil Webster and Charlie Skelton. The storyline follows Woody (Kayvan Novak), an undercover journalist who is a master of disguises but forced to go on the run after an undercover plot is foiled by his corrupt editor. He escapes to a Spanish island where his former mentor Brutus (Bradley Walsh) is now living and running a bar. Initially not pleased to see his protégé, Brutus realises that by letting Woody solve investigations, using a variety of disguises, he can make a profit.
The series was filmed entirely in Gran Canaria with El Faro bar in Puerto de Mogan standing in for Brutus' bar. For the first series six episodes were produced to air on BBC One and the initial one was broadcast on 27 May 2015. The show was not renewed for a second series following negative reviews.

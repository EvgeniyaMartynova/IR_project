== History ==

There was once a monastery founded by St. Molua at nearby Drumsnat. Drumsnat (Drom Sneachta) means the ‘Ridge of Snow’ and, according to tradition, this hill was covered by a mid summer snowfall in answer to the saint’s prayers for a site for a church. The Church of Ireland cemetery also marks the last resting place of Emily and Mary Wilde, the half-sisters of Oscar Wilde, who died following a fire at the nearby Drumaconnor House in 1871

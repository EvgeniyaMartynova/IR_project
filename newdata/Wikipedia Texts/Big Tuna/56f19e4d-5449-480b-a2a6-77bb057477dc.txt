Revolution Overdrive: Songs of Liberty

Revolution Overdrive: Songs of Liberty is a soundtrack to the 2010 video game StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. The album features original and cover songs heard in JoeyRay's bar, a bar in the video game. It is the second soundtrack to the game; the first features the games original score. A vinyl record version of the soundtrack was originally released for BlizzCon 2010. The dual sided record featured 6 tracks on A-side and 5 on B-side. CD and iTunes LP versions of the album were released later that year. These versions feature an additional 3 tracks, and the iTunes version includes extra features, including the StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty trailer, fictional biographies for all the artists on the album (most of which are Blizzard Entertainment house bands), as well as a list of cocktails made in JoeyRays's bar.

== Highly controversial powerline ==
South of Kamionki in 1958 a 220 kV-powerline with a single circuit was built. In 2006 this line was replaced by a new powerline with 4 circuits, 2 for 380 kV and 2 for 220 kV. Although Kamionki grew in meantime, this line was built through a settlement, which resulted in protests as a right of way for a powerline running around Kamionki was available, but this was not done for saving money.

List of names of Odin

Odin (Old Norse Óðinn) is a widely attested god in Germanic mythology. The god is referred to by numerous names and kenningar, particularly in the Old Norse record. 

In Old English, Odin was known as Wōden; in Old Saxon, as Wōdan; and in Old High German, as Wuotan or Wōtan.In the 2001 Neil Gaiman novel American Gods, as well as the 2017 television series based on it, Odin goes mainly by the name Mr. Wednesday.  This is a nod to the fact that the modern English name of the day Wednesday is, itself, derived from the Old English Wōdnesdæg (pronounced [ˈwoːdnezdæj]), which meant Day of Woden or Woden's Day.

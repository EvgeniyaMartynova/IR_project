== History ==
In late 2009, Bell Aliant launched its FibreOP services with deployment commencing in New Brunswick and was the first in Canada to cover an entire city with fibre to the home (FTTH) technology. Simultaneous deployments followed in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island in 2010-2011 with the services available to approximately 1,000,000 homes and businesses by end of 2014. This was an evolution of earlier efforts that saw Bell Aliant predecessor NBTel deploy television services in the Saint John, New Brunswick urban area in the 1990s, followed by a similar deployment in Halifax, Nova Scotia.On July 19, 2016 Bell Canada stated that its FibreOP TV service available in Atlantic Canada would be integrating with Bell Fibe TV in Ontario and Québec.On September 6, 2016, Bell announced a change to their Fibe TV service. Beginning in 2017, the company said Fibe TV customers would no longer be required to also sign up for Fibe Internet service in order to access their Fibe TV service. "As we align our next-generation IPTV technologies, we’re bringing exclusive Fibe features to Atlantic Canada and new options for Fibe TV customers in Ontario and Québec," said Wade Oosterman, Bell Group President and Chief Brand Officer.

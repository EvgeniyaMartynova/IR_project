So Tired (Ozzy Osbourne song)

"So Tired" is a song by heavy metal vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. It was the second single released from his 1983 solo album Bark at the Moon.


== Overview ==
In the music video for the song, Osbourne initially portrays an elderly man who shuffles to bed one night. As he falls asleep, a painting on the wall changes to a live-action street scene, in which a younger Osbourne enters the stage door of a theater and prepares for a performance, only for his dressing room mirror to shatter. The stage manager is a man with a decayed face, and Osbourne's accompaniment is a pit orchestra whose members are half-dead and covered with spiderwebs. As he sings, a deformed hunchback cuts a rope to drop a sandbag on the stage, barely missing him, and a spectator resembling Abraham Lincoln is shot in the back and falls over the railing of his balcony seat. The young and old Osbournes, the hunchback, the stage manager, and the Lincoln lookalike take a bow, and as the song ends, the old Osbourne sits up in bed and the painting returns to normal and falls off the wall. He then settles back down to sleep.
During the filming of the video, a shard of glass from the shattering mirror became lodged in Osbourne's face and throat. Though some scheduled concert dates had to be cancelled, he made a full recovery. 
All of the main characters in the video are portrayed by Osbourne.

Move Along (The Grass Roots album)

Move Along is the sixth studio album by the American rock group The Grass Roots. The album was released in 1972 and charted at #86. It was the last of the group's albums to chart on the Billboard 200. The album marked the departures of longtime drummer Rick Coonce and keyboardist Dennis Provisor from the group, though Provisor still contributed to the album both as a performer (uncredited) and as a composer. The A and B side singles released were "Two Divided by Love", "Glory Bound" b/w "Only One", "The Runway" b/w "Move Along", and "Anyway the Wind Blows" b/w "Monday Love". Later, the song "Someone to Love" was released as the B side to the song "Love Is What You Make It", which appeared on the band's following album, Alotta Mileage.


== Songs ==
The songs featured string and horn arrangements by Jimmie Haskell. Three hit singles were included on Move Along: "Two Divided by Love" (#16), "Glory Bound" (#34), and "The Runway" (#39), with the latter being the last Grass Roots song to reach the top 40. Six of the album's songs were written or co-written by Dennis Provisor, and he sang lead vocals on "Two Divided by Love", "Someone to Love", and "Only One". However, he was not credited for his performances on the album.


== Artwork, packaging ==
Move Along was originally released on Dunhill ABC in stereo. The album was designed by David Larkham of Tepee Graphics. Photos taken by Ed Caraeff.


== Reception ==
In his retrospective review for Allmusic, critic Joe Viglione called the album "interesting and still listenable" but wrote "Slick arrangements and big production eliminate the charm of the earlier recordings.. and has little surprise and none of the sparkle of the Sloan/Barri days, but it is not without merit."

== History ==
The Laredo Ballpark project was first approved by the city council and was voted in favor of (with 61.32% of the votes in favor and 38.68% against) constructing it with money collected by a .25% sales tax increase for the LEC since 2004 of which there is a surplus of about $18 million. The project consisted of building a new multiuse Baseball field near the Laredo Energy Arena(now Sames Auto Arena). On December 9, 2011, it was announced that the stadium would be named Uni-Trade Stadium, after Uni-Trade Forwarding LLC, a local freight forwarder. The park opened on May 17, 2012, with the Lemurs defeating the defending American Association champion Grand Prairie AirHogs 5-1 in front of a crowd of 5,923.


== Field ==
The baseball field playing surface was designed and built by sports field contractor Texas Multi-Chem, out of Kerrville, TX. The baseball field's natural grass surface is TifSport hybrid Bermuda and the root zone consists of an 8" layer of USGA sand and Dakota peat. The field also contains an internal drainage system to help avoid rain outs.

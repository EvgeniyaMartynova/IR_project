== History ==


=== Beginnings ===
The band began as an offshoot of the university's folk music club. Chris Freeman, Antonio Alcorn, and others met weekly in the student union to play traditional music. The gatherings were open to anyone, and didn't hold any performances; nevertheless in late 2010, through a misunderstanding, members of the club were offered an opening set at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut. Freeman and Alcorn put together an impromptu band, and soon recruited music students Harrison Goodale (bass) and Max Shakun (guitar) to continue playing shows.


=== Career ===
In 2013 the band signed to Signature Sounds Recordings and released their self-titled debut album, Poor Old Shine, produced and recorded by Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive, Langhorne Slim) in Parsonsfield, Maine. Erik Hischmann, the session drummer hired for the album, joined the band soon after recording was completed.In July 2014 the band changed its name to Parsonsfield. The following month marked the band's second studio release, Afterparty EP, featuring covers of songs by Mississippi John Hurt, Bert Jansch, and Huey Lewis and the News, as well as traditional songs and one original.In September 2016 the band released its third studio album, Blooming Through The Black, also produced by Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive, Langhorne Slim), and recorded in Collinsville, CT in an abandoned axe factory on the banks of the Farmington River.In March 2018, Parsonsfield released their fourth studio album, WE - produced by Dan Cardinal (Josh Ritter, The Low Anthem, Darlingside) and recorded at Dimension Sound Studios in Boston, MA.

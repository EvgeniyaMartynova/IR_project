== Critical Reception ==
Alex Sievers of KillYourStereo was positive about the EP, giving it a score of 90 (out of 100) and stating "From ‘Backbone’ to ‘167 Damillia’, this EP is gold the whole way through", and praised the band for evolving their sound when compared to their "underwhelming" debut EP Outsider, stating "Unlike their last EP, there is no filler, nor are there any weak links holding down the pack for us hungry critics to surround and devour. Each track is just as good as the track before it and its predecessor".

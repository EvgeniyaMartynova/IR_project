Welsh Harp railway station

Welsh Harp railway station was built by the Midland Railway in 1870 on its extension to St. Pancras station.


== History ==
The station opened on 2 May 1870. With a single island platform between the slow lines, it was important for people escaping from the City for a day out, fishing or boating on the Brent Reservoir built in 1838. It was named after the nearby tavern, the Old Welsh Harp, but only lasted 33 years, closing on 1 July 1903. There are now no visible remains of the station.

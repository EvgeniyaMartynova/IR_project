Robert Henry Hurst (senior)

Robert Henry Hurst (1788–1857) was an English Whig politician.  He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Horsham from 1832 to 1841, and from 1844 to 1847.
Hurst was elected to the House of Commons at the 1832 general election.  He was re-elected in 1835 and  1837, but did not stand in  1841 general election.  However his Conservative successor Robert Scarlett succeeded to the peerage in 1844, and Hurst was elected unopposed at the resulting by-election.  He did not seek re-election in 1847.
His son Robert Henry Hurst (junior) was later MP for Horsham.

Division of Goldstein

The Division of Goldstein is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria. The division was created in 1984, when the former Division of Balaclava was abolished. It is located in the bayside suburbs of Melbourne, including Beaumaris, Bentleigh, Brighton, Caulfield South, Cheltenham, Gardenvale and Sandringham.


== History ==

The division is named after Vida Goldstein, an early feminist parliamentary candidate who contested five separate elections within the first two decades after Federation. It has always been a safe seat for the Liberal Party; it and its predecessor seat of Balaclava has always gone to the Liberals and its predecessors. When combined, the seat is one of very few that has never been held by the Labor Party at any point since 1901.
Its most prominent members include Ian Macphee, a minister under Malcolm Fraser and prominent Liberal moderate; and Andrew Robb, a former federal director of the Liberal Party who served as a minister under John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull.

Black Rock, Millard County, Utah

Black Rock was an unincorporated village in the Beaver Bottoms in southern Millard County, Utah, United States, about 20 miles (32 km) north of Milford.


== Description ==
The town was a station stop on the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad (later Union Pacific Railroad), and was a community center for the few settlers in the area during the late nineteenth century. As area roads and vehicular travel improved beginning in the twentieth century, its relative importance waned. A post office operated at Black Rock from 1891 to 1959. The site is now a ghost town.
The town was named for a nearby rock formation.

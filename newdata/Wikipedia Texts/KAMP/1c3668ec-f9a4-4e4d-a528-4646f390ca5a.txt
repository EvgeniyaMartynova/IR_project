== The "other" KAMP-LP ==
In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, the FCC granted a temporary license to a group in Houston, Texas, for a low-power station to broadcast relief information for evacuees inside the Astrodome and the nearby Reliant Center. The station, dubbed KAMP ("Dome City Radio"), was shut down by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over technical and security concerns. The KAMP callsign was unofficial, an acronym for Katrina Aftermath Media Project, as the official KAMP-LP callsign belongs to the Alaska LPFM. This was one of 20 temporary licenses for low-power emergency relief stations issued by the FCC in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

Welham was founded in 1937 as a preparatory school for boarding schools in England and India, by Miss Oliphant, an English lady, with a capital of £1000. There were no funds or staff, and no school buildings. Miss Oliphant recruited another retired English lady, Miss Grace Mary Linnell, to run the boarding school for girls, and Miss Linnell became the Founder-Principal of Welham Girls School. Under Miss Linnell’s guidance Welham Girls High School, as it was known then, established itself as a boarding school.In 1956 Miss Oliphant donated all her assets to the Welham Boys' School, which presently is administered by a Board of Trustees. Mr. S. K. (Charlie) Kandhari took over as principal in January 1983.

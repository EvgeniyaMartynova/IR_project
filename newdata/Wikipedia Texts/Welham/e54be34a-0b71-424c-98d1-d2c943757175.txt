== History ==
Welham was named after the little Welsh village from where its founder, H. Oliphant hailed. A retired English head mistress, Oliphant started Welham Boys School in 1937. She was struck by The Lawrence School, Sanawar and lack of schools of similar quality for the girls around Dehradun.
She acquired a palatial estate called Nasreen adjacent to Welham Boys School to start a small boarding school for girls. There were no funds, staff, or school buildings. Oliphant recruited another retired English woman, Grace Mary Linnel, to run the boarding school for girls. Linnell became the founder principal of Welham Girls School, which started in 1957. Welham Girls’ High School, as it was known then, established itself as a full-fledged boarding school. From its initial crop of 10 students, it has grown to over 600 students.

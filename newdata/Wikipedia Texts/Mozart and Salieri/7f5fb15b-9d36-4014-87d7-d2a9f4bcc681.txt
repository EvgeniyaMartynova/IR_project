Mozart and Salieri (play)

Mozart and Salieri (Russian: «Мо́царт и Салье́ри», romanized: Mótsart i Sal'yéri) is a poetic drama by Alexander Pushkin. The play was written in 1830 as one of his four short plays known as The Little Tragedies, and was published in 1832. Based on one of the numerous rumours caused by the early death of Mozart, it features only two characters: Mozart and Antonio Salieri. It was the only one of Pushkin's plays that was staged during his lifetime. Mozart and Salieri was the inspiration for Peter Shaffer's Amadeus.

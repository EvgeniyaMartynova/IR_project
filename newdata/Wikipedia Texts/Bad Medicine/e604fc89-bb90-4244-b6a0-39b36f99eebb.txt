Bad Medicine (truck)

Bad Medicine was a monster truck that raced on the USHRA circuit from 1991 and 1992.  It was owned and driven by Don Van Loo.  The truck was the famous Carolina Crusher 2, however modified to fit the smaller Dodge Dakota body.  The truck was notorious for its crash at Oklahoma in its first race, in which driver Don VanLoo was knocked unconscious after a bad landing, and at the time of being knocked unconscious was on the gas pedal, so the truck rammed into the wall, yet those in the front row of seats were uninjured, and neither was VanLoo. The entire track crew and several drivers, including Gary Porter, then of Carolina Crusher, now of Grave Digger, to check on VanLoo's condition. It was also notorious for its out of control behavior.  Notably, it was involved in an incident at a show in Niagara Falls, New York which resulted in the death of one of the track crew, 82-year-old Lester Gilliam, the sport's first fatality and one of only a few in the sport's history. Before being killed, Lester pushed a young child to safety saving him from certain death.

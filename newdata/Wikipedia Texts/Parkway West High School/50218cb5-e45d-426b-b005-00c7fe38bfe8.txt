Parkway West High School (Ballwin, Missouri)

Parkway West High School is a public comprehensive high school in Ballwin, Missouri that is part of the Parkway School District.


== History ==
PWHS was the second high school built in the Parkway School District; it opened in the fall of 1968 with grades 10-12. In the 1969-1970 school year, Parkway West Junior High was formed, and grades 7-9 were housed in the West Senior building operating on the same schedule as West Senior. For the 1970-71 school year, West Senior operated as a four year high school (grades 9-12), with West Junior grades 7 & 8 attending Parkway South Junior High School on a split schedule. Members of the Class of '74 attended school in the West Senior building for five straight years. West Junior opened for the 1971-1972 school year with the new "open classroom" layout. One of the unusual features of PWHS was that for 13 years under the leadership of principal Al Burr, they operated without any written rules or regulations—only mutual agreements and expectations.

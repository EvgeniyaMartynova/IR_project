Golin language

Golin (also Gollum, Gumine) is a Papuan language of Papua New Guinea.


== Phonology ==


=== Vowels ===
Diphthongs that occur are /ɑi ɑu ɔi ui/. The consonants /l n/ can also be syllabic.


=== Consonant ===
/bʷ ɡʷ/ are treated as single consonants by Bunn & Bunn (1970), but as combinations of /b/ + /w/, /ɡ/ + /w/ by Evans et al. (2005).
Two consonants appear to allow free variation in their realisations: [s] varies with [ʃ], and [l] with [ɬ].
/n/ assimilates to [ŋ] before /k/ and /ɡ/.


=== Tone ===
Golin is a tonal language, distinguishing high ([˧˥]), mid ([˨˧]), and low ([˨˩]) tone. The high tone is marked by an acute accent and the low tone by a grave accent, while the mid tone is left unmarked. Examples:
High: mú [mu˧˥] 'type of snake'; wí [wi˧˥] 'scream (man)'
Mid: mu [mu˨˧] 'type of bamboo'; wi [wi˨˧] 'coming from the same ethnic group'
Low: mù [mu˨˩] 'sound of river'; wì [wi˨˩] 'cut (verb)'


== Pronouns ==
Golin is notable for having a small pronominal paradigm. There are two basic pronouns:
ná first person
í second personThere is no number distinction and no true third person pronoun. In fact, third person pronouns in Golin are in fact compounds derived from ‘man’ plus inín ‘self’:

yalíni ‘he’ < yál ‘man’ + inín ‘self’
abalíni ‘she’ < abál ‘woman’ + inín ‘self’

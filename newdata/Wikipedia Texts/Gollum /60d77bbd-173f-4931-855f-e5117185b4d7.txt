Gollum browser

Gollum browser is a web application for accessing the encyclopedia, Wikipedia. Since 2017, Gollum is no longer accessible online.
Gollum is designed to browse Wikipedia in an easier way than directly using the web browser. Links external to Wikipedia are opened in the user's regular browser. Gollum is opened from a regular browser and makes a window that puts the Wikipedia search bar on the toolbar. Gollum was created by Harald Hanek in 2005 using PHP and Ajax. According to one blogger, Gollum provides a way to bypass censorship of Wikipedia in China.

== Toponymy ==
The name (Kancabchén) is a word from the Mayan language meaning the well of the red ground.


== How to get there ==
Go east out of Mérida on highway 180 approximately 42 km to the exit for the town of Hoctun. Head south approximately 35 km though the towns of Xocchel, Sahcabá, Huhí to Zavala. At Zavala turn southwest on Calle 8 and follow the road approximately 6 km to Hacienda Kancabchén.


== History ==

In 1939 the name changed from Kancabchén to Chan Kancabchén; in 1970, it changed again to Kanka-Chen; and in 1990 it returned to Kancabchén.


== Demographics ==
All of the henequen plantations ceased to exist as autonomous communities with the agrarian land reform implemented by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937. His decree turned the haciendas into collective ejidos, leaving only 150 hectares to the former landowners for use as private property. Figures before 1937 indicate populations living on the farm. After 1937, figures indicate those living in the community, as the remaining Hacienda Kancabchén houses only the owner's immediate family.
According to the 2005 census conducted by the INEGI, the population of the city was 11 inhabitants.

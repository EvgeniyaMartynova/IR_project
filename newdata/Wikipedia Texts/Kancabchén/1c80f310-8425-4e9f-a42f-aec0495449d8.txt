== Toponymy ==
The name (Kancabchén) is a word from the Mayan language meaning the well of the red ground. Valencia is a city in Spain.


== How to get there ==
Go east out of Mérida from the Pereférico toward Valladolid on highway 180, for approximately 85 km. Turn left and proceed north approximately 500m to Hacienda Kancabchén de Valencia.


== History ==

In 1940, the name was changed from Kancabchén to Kancabchén de Valencia and it changed from the Municipality of Izamal to the Municipality of Sudzal.


== Demographics ==
All of the henequen plantations ceased to exist as autonomous communities with the agrarian land reform implemented by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937. His decree turned the haciendas into collective ejidos, leaving only 150 hectares to the former landowners for use as private property. Figures before 1937 indicate populations living on the farm. After 1937, figures indicate those living in the community, as the remaining Hacienda Kancabchén de Valencia houses only the owner's immediate family.
According to the 2005 census conducted by the INEGI, the population of the city was 26 inhabitants, of whom 16 were men and 10 were women.

Hacienda Kankabchén (Tixkokob)

== Toponymy ==
The name (Kancabchén) is a word from the Mayan language meaning the well of the red ground.

== History ==


== Architecture ==
As is evident from photographs, the architectural structures have decayed and no habitable buildings remain.


== Demographics ==
All of the henequen plantations ceased to exist as autonomous communities with the agrarian land reform implemented by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937. His decree turned the haciendas into collective ejidos, leaving only 150 hectares to the former landowners for use as private property. Figures before 1937 indicate populations living on the farm. After 1937, figures indicate those living in the community, as the remaining Hacienda Kankabchén houses only the owner's immediate family.
According to the 2005 census conducted by the INEGI, there is no permanent population residing in the area.

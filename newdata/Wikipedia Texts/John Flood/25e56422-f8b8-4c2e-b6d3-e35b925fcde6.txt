John Joe Flood

John Joe Flood, also referred to as Jonjo Flood or John Flood, was an Irish footballer who played as a forward for Shelbourne, Shamrock Rovers, Leeds United and Crystal Palace. As an international, he also played for and captained the Irish Free State yielding an impressive return of 4 goals in 5 games. Flood was also part of the League of Ireland XI setup (1925–1933) which was viewed by fans of the day as an international team when playing against the likes of the Scottish/Welsh/IFA League XI sides. He played eight times and scored 3 goals.


== Club career ==
Flood play for Shelbourne before joining Shamrock Rovers. After helping Rovers win their first ever League of Ireland title in 1923 he joined Leeds United, together with Bob Fullam. However neither of them managed to establish themselves at United and they both rejoined Rovers for the following season. Back with Rovers, together with Fullam, John Fagan and Billy Farrell he was an integral part of a legendary forward-line known as the Four F's. During the 1924–25 season they helped Rovers win a League of Ireland / League of Ireland Shield / FAI Cup treble. They won the FAI Cup after beating Shelbourne 2–1 at Dalymount Park before an attendance of 25,000. Flood and Fullam scored the two goals against their former club. During his career Flood also had a spell with Crystal Palace. In April 1932 he was awarded a benefit game which broke all previous attendance records and signified the impact that the popular Flood had on the game in the country at the time.

Between 1926 and 1931 Flood made 5 appearances and scored 4 goals for the Irish Free State. He made his international debut in a 3–0 away defeat against Italy on 21 March 1926.

On 26 April 1931 he captained the Irish Free State against Spain. Together with Tom Farquharson, Peter Kavanagh and Paddy Moore he was part of a team that gained a respectable 1–1 draw at the Montjuic Stadium in Barcelona.

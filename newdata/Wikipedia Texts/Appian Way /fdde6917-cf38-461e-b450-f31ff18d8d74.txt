Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up

Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up is a 1969 album by Jeff Simmons, produced by Frank Zappa, who wrote two songs for the album under the pseudonym "La Marr Bruister".
The title track, in which Zappa himself rips the lead guitar, was later rerecorded as part of Zappa's 1979 album, Joe's Garage. Another track, "Wonderful Wino," was rerecorded and released on Zappa's 1976 album, Zoot Allures.
The album features musicians Craig Tarwater and John Kehlior, both of whom had previously been members of the Seattle group The Daily Flash.
Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up was described as the second best album on the Straight Records label by Mojo Magazine. In 2007, it was re-issued on CD by World In Sound Records.

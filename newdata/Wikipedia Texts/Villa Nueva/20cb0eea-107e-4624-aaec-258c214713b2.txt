Sacramento, Coahuila

Sacramento is a city in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila. 
The city serves as the administrative centre for the surrounding municipality of the same name.
Sacramento is located at 27°00′13″N 101°43′29″W in the state's central region (Región Centro), some 250 km north of state capital Saltillo, and some 50 km north-west of former state capital Monclova, on Federal Highway 30.

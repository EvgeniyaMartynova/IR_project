Pars News Agency

The Islamic Republic News Agency (Persian: خبرگزاری جمهوری اسلامی‎), or IRNA, is the official news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is government-funded and controlled under the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. The agency also publishes the newspaper Iran. As of 2010, the Managing Director of IRNA is Mohammad Khodaddi. IRNA has 60 offices in Iran and 30 more in various countries around the world.


== History ==
In 1934, Pars Agency was established by the Foreign Ministry of Iran (Persia) as the country's official national news outlet. For the next six years it operated under the Iranian Foreign Ministry working to disseminate national and international news. Pars Agency published a bulletin twice daily in French and Persian, which it circulated among government officials, international news agencies in Tehran and the local press. In May 1940, the General Tablighat Department was founded and the agency then became an affiliate of the department. Agence France Press (AFP) was the first international news agency whose reports Pars Agency used. Gradually, the Iranian news agency expanded its sources of news stories to include those of Reuters, the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). An agreement with the Anatolia News Agency of Turkey further expanded the agency's news outlets to countries worldwide. The link-up also enabled it to provide classified bulletins to a limited number of high-ranking public officials.
In 1954, following a coup the reforms of the White Revolution helped to modernize the Pars Agency, leading to expanded news coverage, improved professional services and a better-educated staff. It went on air with radio broadcasts of international news translated into Persian, which it offered to local subscribers. Under the new regime, it operated under the supervision of various state offices and ministries such as the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephones, Office of the Prime Minister and the Labor Ministry until 1947. In 1957, the General Department of Tablighat fell under the supervision of the Publications Department of Tehran Radio as an independent department. In 1963 the activities of Pars Agency were brought under the newly created Information Ministry. Its name was changed to Pars News Agency, or PANA, and it began operating around the clock. In July 1975 the Iranian legislature passed a bill establishing the Ministry of Information and Tourism and changing the status of Pars News Agency to a joint public stock with capital assets of about 300 million rials. It then became an affiliate of the new ministry. Its Articles of Association in 23 paragraphs and notes were adopted by the then National Consultative Assembly of Iran.
After the Iranian Revolution in February 1979, the Revolutionary Council (Shawra-ye-Enqelab), in June 1979, renamed the Ministry of Information and Tourism to the National Guidance Ministry (or Ministry of National Guidance). The same year Pars News Agency was renamed as the Islamic Republic News Agency.


== Official guidelines ==
IRNA's professional activities are aimed at securing Iranian national interests. Efforts of management and professional personnel of IRNA are thus focused on achieving higher ground each day in fulfillment of its stated goal. The organization functions as the "mother source of information dissemination" within the country, feeding its authorities, nationals and various publications with various types of news, bulletins, research works, opinion polls and stories of general interest through its various telex lines. It also provides channels for online foreign dispatches and photographs around the clock. IRNA's external services include those rendered to leading international news agencies in accordance with contracts signed with them, active membership in international news clubs, up-to-date news stories on the country supplied internationally through its International News Line, and an active presence in the Internet through its Persian, English and Arabic websites. For its services, IRNA is aided by a professional core of executive and administrative staff who work inside and outside the country in its various local, regional and overseas branches. It also takes full advantage of stringers around the globe and has an organizational set-up that allows all its facilities to be used inside or outside the country on contractual arrangement. To effectively carry out its responsibilities it has set up the following guidelines:

Promotion of the Islamic culture as far as possible and encountering the cultural onslaught of enemies of the Islamic Revolution.
Expansion of activities conducive to the acquisition and dissemination of more news items inside and outside the country.
Dissemination of news stories of the Islamic world in general.
Providing news items to Iranian newspapers and periodicals.

== IRNA external services ==
IRNA's administrative efforts are focused on an expansion of its international news branches around the globe. Branches ostensibly are given the task of producing news items or selecting from those produced by various news agencies, translating and disseminating them through its various news lines. Its management is also constantly on the look-out for possible new ways of expanding its level of news dissemination in qualitative and quantitative terms. It also seeks to expand its level of cooperation with various foreign news agencies and corporations. Personnel of IRNA branches abroad are currently in charge of monitoring their respective countries' radio, television, satellite and Internet networks to bring out news items not already found in news dispatches. The offices also organize regional news dissemination corporationswith IRNA as a member, as well as monitor and program activities of its branches.


== IRNA news desks ==
IRNA's editorial board is made up of eight main news desks:

Europe and America Desk
Africa and Middle East Desk
Asia-Pacific Desk
Indian Peninsula and Central Asia Desk
English News Desk – this desk is in charge of sending the most important news gathered from IRNA's various lines, as well as those items acquired through various IRNA cooperation contracts with various news agencies
Arabic News Desk – the activities of this desk is similar to the English News Desk
Persian Language International News Desk – staff of this desk are assigned the task of surveying news items dispatched from various IRNA news lines in the country and selecting those most likely to interest foreign readers; these are then rewritten as new items with information that are not included as being of no general importance to Iranian readers inside the country added and those that need revision altered
Foreign News Desk – this desk comprises three monitoring desks in charge of surveying the various foreign radio, television, satellite, Internet and printed media items, and selecting the news items that IRNA is interested in; this organization works on a 24-hour basis and records programs of 23 radio and 13 satellite stations on video or magnetic tapes


== IRNA news regions ==
IRNA has divided its activities into four news regions around 
the world manned by four head offices:
Middle East and Africa Region – The head office is based in Beirut, Lebanon. It has branch offices in Ankara, Damascus, Abu Dhabi, Amman and Kuwait. All six offices cover news stories in the entire Middle East and Africa region.
Europe and America Region – The head office is based in London, England. It has branch offices in Bonn, Vienna, Paris, Rome, Sarajevo, Athens, Madrid, New York City and Washington. All 10 offices cover news items pertaining to Europe and the North, Central and South American continents.
Asia-Pacific Region – The head office of this region is based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It has branch offices in Tokyo, Beijing, Islamabad, Alma Ata, Dushanbe and Ashkhabad. All seven offices cover news stories from Asia and the Oceania region.


== Cooperation with foreign and regional news agencies ==
IRNA cooperates with leading international and regional news agencies. This cooperation at the professional level started decades ago. IRNA's cooperation with regional and international agencies takes any of the following forms:

Exclusive agency contracts – Certain international news sources cooperate exclusively with IRNA in news dissemination service within Iranian territory. This implies that access to news items and pictorial telex services of other news sources is possible only through IRNA's news dissemination telex lines. News stories referred to include those of Reuters, AP, AFP, UPI and the DPA (of Germany).
Bilateral cooperation  contracts – IRNA has signed contracts for the exchange of photographs and news items with a number of regional new agencies. This may be taken as an unprecedented move since before the victory of the Islamic Revolution the Pars News Agency (IRNA's name before the revolution) merely cooperated with Western news agencies. The news agencies of Qatar (QNA), Serbia (TANJUG), China (Xinhua), Japan (Kyodo), Turkey (Ikhlas), North Korea (KCNA), Saudi Arabia (SANA), Spain (EFE), Vietnam (VNA), Turkmenistan (Turkmen Press), Russia (Itar-Tass and Ria-Novesti), Morocco (MAP), Nigeria (NAM), and South Korea (YONHAP) have signed bilateral cooperation contracts regarding exchange of news and pictures with IRNA. In July 2014, IRNA signed an agreement with Italian news agency Adnkronos International to promote bilateral news cooperation.
Contracts for sales of pictures and news items – IRNA has signed contracts for the sale of its news photos and information to major international news agencies. These include Reuters, AP, DPA, BBC and Bloomberg as well as the Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA).


== Membership in international news clubs and organizations ==
IRNA has spent tremendous efforts to convince news agencies of Third World countries to actively work within the framework of regional news agencies. The establishment of pools of news agencies, many of which have already gained international prestige, is thus indebted to the pioneering efforts of IRNA. 
Multinational and regional news pools therefore have the right to 
vote in international gatherings of news agencies and thus play the essential and critical role of safeguarding Third World interests in such venues. 
IRNA is currently a member of the following news pools:

Association of Caspian Sea News Agencies (ACSNA)
ECO News Agencies (ECONA)
International Islamic News Agency (IINA)
Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool (NANAP)
Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA)
OPEC News Agency (OPECNA)


== IRNA's recognized achievements within regional news pools ==
IRNA has played an active role as a member of the newly established regional news pools mentioned above. Its varied activities in cooperation with these various organizations may be summarized as follows:

Providing vast coverage for news stories from the Islamic World as well as the Third World and Central Asian countries. IRNA has also expanded its national news dissemination ties with Islamic countries to an unprecedented level, i.e., between any Islamic country and that of other members of the Islamic world.

== History ==

San Juan Bautista de Purén was a fort founded by Juan Gomez de Almagro, by order of the Governor of Chile Pedro de Valdivia, almost in the center of the northwest part of the valley of Purén, a little more than a kilometer from the left bank of the Purén River in the Purén valley and about six kilometers to the northeast of  the present city of Purén.
This fort was abandoned on the death of Pedro de Valdivia but was reoccupied by García Hurtado de Mendoza, after a bitter campaign with the followers of Caupolicán on May 20, 1558.  Guanoalca captured and burned it in 1586.  Rebuilt by Governor Alonso de Sotomayor in 1589,  it received some improvements but it was always harassed by the Mapuche, and was again abandoned and set afire by them in the 1598 Mapuche rising that exploded after the Disaster of Curalaba.
The fort was again restored under the governor  Alonso Garcia Ramon in 1609, lost again and rebuilt by governor Alonso de Ribera in 1613 and was again abandoned in 1624.  So it remained until 1665, when governor Francisco de Meneses Brito again built a fort there and repopulated it.  Finally in 1723, Governor Gabriel Cano de Aponte decided to order its demolition and permanent abandonment, moving the garrison to the fort of San Carlos de Purén called Purén Nuevo (New Purén), on the Bio Bio River.  The old ruins continued to be known as Old Purén and those ruins were still to be seen in the 1890s.On November 24, 1868, a new fort was built in Puren, located at 38° 04' Lat. and 73° 06' Lon., between the brooks Nahuelco and Panqueco, a little more than three kilometers from the south or right bank of the upper part of the Purén River.  To the northeast on the opposite shore of the Purén river is the location that the old Purén fortress occupied.  A village had sprung up next to the fort by the 1890s following the occupation of Araucania.Recently, some pre-Hispanic proto-pyramids or mounds have been discovered near Purén.

== Critical reception ==
At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66% based on 6 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".Tom Briehan of Pitchfork gave the album a 6.1 out of 10, saying, "Sole has largely curbed his frantic, out-of-control, sometimes-arrhythmic rap style, going for a measured and controlled thing instead." David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5, saying, "the album's title references Sole's desire to bring the underground angst to the masses, injecting a little ugliness and art into your everyday programming." Thomas Quinlan of Exclaim! said: "While it's unlikely Hello Cruel World will reach far beyond Sole's current fan base, it should continue to impress those who are already fans, offering a slightly different perspective on the unorthodox MC."Westword included it on the "Denver's Best Music Releases of 2011" list.

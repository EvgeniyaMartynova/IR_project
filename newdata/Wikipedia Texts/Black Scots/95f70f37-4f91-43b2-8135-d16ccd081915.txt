=== Sport ===


==== Association football ====
The British Guiana-born Andrew Watson is widely considered to be the world's first association footballer of black heritage (his father was white and mother black) to play at international level. He was capped three times for Scotland between 1881 and 1882. Watson also played for Queen's Park, the leading Scottish club at the time, and later became their secretary. He led the team to several Scottish Cup wins, thus becoming the first player of black heritage to win a major competition.With some brief exceptions, such as Jamaican born Gil Heron at Celtic, Walter Tull signing for Rangers, and John Walker at Hearts, Black players largely disappeared from Scottish football for the next 100 years until the arrival of Mark Walters at Rangers in 1988. Walters arrival at the club resulted in incidents of racial abuse.The Scotland national team did not call up a second player of black heritage until Nigel Quashie (black Ghanaian father and white English mother), made his debut against Estonia in May 2004. He qualified to play for Scotland, due to having a grandfather from Scotland. Subsequently Coatbridge born Chris Iwelumo (black father from Nigeria), has also played for Scotland.

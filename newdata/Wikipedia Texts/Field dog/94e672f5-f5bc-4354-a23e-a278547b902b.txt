Flushing dog

A flushing dog is a gun dog trained to flush game, especially birds, by first finding the game then driving it from its hiding place for a hunter to shoot or capture. 
Flushing dogs are different from other gun dog types such as pointers and setters, dogs which remain still after locating the game, or retrievers, dogs that fetch the game after it has been shot. Some types of dogs have been specially bred for flushing ability, such as Springer, Cocker and other spaniels. Other breeds of gun dog are also often trained as flushing dogs, especially retrievers. Most flushing dogs are very people-friendly and make excellent companions and pets.

Every classroom in the school is equipped with a computer, overhead projector, and Smartboard. The set-up in each class is linked by LAN to a server that stores an array of educational content. Teachers use the Smartboards for teaching purposes, to store lessons, and to demonstrate the ready-made content available on the server.

Another addition of technology-facilitated education is an English Language laboratory. This application allows the students to improve their spoken language by hearing and practising correct pronunciation. They are able to then check their progress in a personalized manner. The Language Lab has a number of computers with earphones and speakers.

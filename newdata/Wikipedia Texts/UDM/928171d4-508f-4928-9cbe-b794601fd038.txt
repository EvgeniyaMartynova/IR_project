Universidad de Manila

The Universidad de Manila (UdM) (formerly known as the City College of Manila) is a city government funded, public local university in Manila, Philippines. Its Main Campus is located at the grounds of Mehan Gardens, near the Central Terminal Station of LRTA Line 1. It has an annex campus in Carriedo Street (Downtown Campus). It formerly maintained a campus at the 15-storey old PNB Building in Escolta Street but it was razed by a fire in 2015 and was finally demolished in 2016. The Division of City Schools-Manila has its headquarters at the main campus of UDM.

UDM was founded as the City College of Manila (CCM) by Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim. Mayor Lito Atienza renamed it Universidad de Manila in 2006.  The school reverted to its original name in 2007 when Mayor Lim retook City Hall. However, a few months into office, he renamed it Gat Andrés Bonifacio University.


== History ==

Universidad de Manila was founded in 1995 during the term of Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim. It was then located in the old 12-storey high Philippine National Bank Building in the district of Santa Cruz.

In its early years, and before it acquired its current name and status, many controversies haunted the CCM. Among the issues were the low passing rates that it had received and its proposed transformation into a district college of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. PLM and the CCM students opposed the plan; thus, it never materialized.
In early 2005, many environmental groups resisted the construction of the new building at the Mehan Garden, but there were  organizations that backed the move. Later on, the City Council unanimously voted in favor of transferring the CCM's main building to the site, and the construction of a five-storey edifice ensued. In that same year, the CCM integrated sports in its curriculum in line with the plan of establishing the Manila Sports Academy, which is tasked to provide free college education to deserving athletes and outstanding performers and develop future sports educators. Additionally, the college took part in the enforcement of English as the medium of instruction.A year later, Manila City officials, including Mayor Lito Atienza, initiated the elevation of CCM to a university to promote higher learning and provide more opportunities to Manila youth for a quality education. By virtue of the amendments of Ordinance No. 7885, which was authored by majority floor leader Ernesto Dionisio and some members of the majority bloc, the CCM acquired the name Universidad de Manila (UDM). During the same year, UDM hosted the International Youth Expo, with the theme, "Showcasing an Ideal World through Visuals."In 2007, the Commission on Higher Education allowed the UDM to confer postgraduate studies. On November 30 of the same year, during the commemoration of the 144th birth anniversary of Andrés Bonifacio, Lim renamed the school in honor of Bonifacio, who despite of financial difficulties pursued knowledge through self-education.UDM has three buildings, in the Annex, Escolta and the Main Building.

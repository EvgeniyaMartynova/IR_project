UDM allied itself with the Orange Democratic Movement in supporting Raila Odinga's candidacy for the office of President of Kenya, and fielded several candidates in the parliamentary elections. Its most prominent member of that parliament was Hellen Sambili who served as Minister of East African Cooperation in Kenya's grand coalition government. The party was briefly subject to a leadership struggle as a faction of 'rebel' ODM Members of Parliament, allied to William Ruto attempted to take control of the party to use it as their platform for the 2012 elections. However, following resistance from the existing leadership Ruto and his allies opted to form the United Republican Party. in December 2012, the party was part of a short lived four party coalition, including the National Vision Party, New Ford Kenya and Kenya African National Union to field a single presidential candidate at the 2013 general elections, before finally settling on becoming part of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy

Many of its leaders came from university-based organization. Inside PDCH MAS confronted the "El Palo" faction for influence over the organization.MAS sought to replace the leaderships inside popular organizations linked to the Christian Democratic movement. MAS activists founded the peasants organization Unión Nacional de Campesinos Auténticos de Honduras (UNCAH) in September 1977.The MAS tendency was expelled from the party at the Seventh National Plenum of the party.

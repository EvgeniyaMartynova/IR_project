Laura Branigan (album)

Touch is the fifth album by American singer Laura Branigan, released in 1987 on Atlantic Records.
This album marked a change in Branigan's career. Under new management and using a different producer, the singer took a more active role in the studio, gaining hands-on experience which she used to self-produce tracks on her subsequent albums. 
Touch also saw her return to dancefloors with the first single, the Stock/Aitken/Waterman-produced "Shattered Glass", which was released in June 1987 and was a US top 50 hit. She had a Top 40 hit with a cover of Jennifer Rush's minor U.S. hit, "Power of Love", which was released in October 1987. "Spirit of Love" was released as a single in Europe. "Cry Wolf" was the album's third single release in the US, and was a top 30 AC hit.

== Inconsiderate Bitch ==
The Inconsiderate Bitch EP is the third solo release by Lisa Germano, and her first for the 4AD label.  It was one of a series of limited-edition "temporary releases" by 4AD, meant to supplement concurrent releases by the same act; in this case, Inconsiderate Bitch acted as a "teaser" for the label's re-release of Happiness, while also serving as an introduction of Germano to her new label's audience.  While preparing and resequencing the album for its re-release, 4AD founder and then-president Ivo Watts-Russell and engineer John Fryer (who had worked on Watts-Russell's This Mortal Coil project) also created this suite of alternate remixes, with the exception of "(Late Night) Dresses", a version of "You Make Me Wanto Wear Dresses" (later retitled "The Dresses Song") remixed by the original producer, Malcolm Burn.


== Track listing ==
"Happiness"
"Energy"
"Puppet"
"Sycophant"
(Late Night) DressesAll songs were written by Lisa Germano, except track 4 written by Germano/Joyce.
Tracks 2-5 were later added to an edition of Happiness re-released by 4AD in 1999, but have since been removed for subsequent editions.  Track 1 remains available only on this CD; with a running time of 8:17, it is considerably extended compared to the two album versions.

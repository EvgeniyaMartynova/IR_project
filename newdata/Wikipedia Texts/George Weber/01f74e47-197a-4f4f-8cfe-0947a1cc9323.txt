George D. Weber

George "Boots" Weber (March 2, 1925 â€“ November 19, 2012) was an American politician from Missouri. He was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee to represent the 2nd congressional district in 2004 and 2006, losing to incumbent Todd Akin both times. In 1998, he was the Reform Party nominee for State Auditor, losing the race to Democrat Claire McCaskill. He announced a candidacy for U.S. President in the 2008 Missouri primary.  He was elected to the Missouri State House of Representatives for District 11 in 1964 and served a two-year term.


== Education ==
He graduated from Eureka High School in 1942 and went on to attend the University of Missouri.


== Career ==
Prior to his graduation at Missouri, he joined the Marine Corps. After the war he became a farmer and later a real estate broker. He served in the Missouri State Legislature 1964-1966.


== Issues ==
Weber was pro-life and pro gun ownership, but believed existing gun laws need to be better enforced. He was a strong conservationist and believed clean water is about to become a major economic and conservation issue. His conservative social views made him vulnerable to insurgent campaigns in the Democratic primaries in 2004 and 2006, but he narrowly won the nomination both years. The largely progressive Democratic mainstream in St. Louis County, however, was slow to embrace him as a candidate despite his frequent campaigns for office in the area.

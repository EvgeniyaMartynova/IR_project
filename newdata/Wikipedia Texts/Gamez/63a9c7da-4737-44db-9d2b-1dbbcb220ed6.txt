Robert Gamez

Robert Anthony Gamez (born July 21, 1968) is an American professional golfer who currently plays on the PGA Tour.
Gamez was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is of Mexican descent. He attended the University of Arizona where was a member of the golf team. He played on the 1989 Walker Cup Team and dropped out of university to turn professional later that same year.Gamez has had what can be described as a hot and cold career as a professional golfer. He started out winning two tournaments in his rookie season on the Tour, including his first event, the Northern Telecom Tucson Open. Only three other golfers, Marty Fleckman in 1967, Ben Crenshaw in 1973 and Garrett Willis in 2001, have won their first PGA event. He is possibly most well known for holing his second shot from the fairway on the tough 18th hole in the final round at the 1990 Nestle Invitational, giving him a one stroke win over Greg Norman. A commemorative plaque has since been placed in the fairway on the 18th hole at Bay Hill to mark the spot from which Gamez holed his 7-iron from 176 yards.In 1998, Gamez was injured in a car accident at the Kemper Open and his career started to decline. Between 1998 and 2001, he failed to finish in the top 125 on the PGA Tour money list. His career hit a low point in 2001, when he failed to qualify for the Tour. Then he began to enjoy a resurgence in his career. He finished in the top-125 every year between 2002-2005 including a T-5 at the Bank of America Colonial in 2004 and a win at the 2005 Valero Texas Open. It was his first win in 15 years, 6 months (394 events), a PGA Tour record. His best finish in a major is T12 at the 1990 Open Championship.Gamez hosts an annual tournament in Orlando, Florida for the benefit of the Team Gamez Foundation. He lives in Orlando, Florida. He has not played a full season on any tour since 2008. He is a Republican.

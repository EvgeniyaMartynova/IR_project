=== Rivals ===
Each video game will have one or more rivals. Some rivals can be renamed, while some rivals cannot. They roughly correspond to several other characters in the anime and the manga. In the Pokémon video games, the rivals will usually pick a starter Pokémon which has a type advantage over the player's own. (Some rivals are exceptions.)

Blue (グリーン, Green): The rival of Pokémon Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, and Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. He is pushy and competitive, but is generally a good Pokémon Trainer. He is the grandson of Professor Oak and the player's childhood friend. After that he became the champion waiting for player to challenge. Blue is the basis for Gary Oak in the anime. IGN listed Blue as the 98th best villain in video games, though they stressed that it was difficult to view him as a villain. However, they did say that he was kind of a "douche", citing his attempt to prevent the player character from getting a map. Three years later in Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal, and their remakes, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, he becomes a Gym Leader for Viridian City.
Silver (シルバー, Silver): The rival of Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, and Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. This character steals his first Pokémon from Professor Elm, and tends to see Pokémon as tools, to use and discard. Unlike the first rival, his view on Pokémon makes him a mediocre trainer, though the sage in the Sprout Tower recognises that he is talented, and has great potential. He eventually realizes his wrongdoings and changes his ways by treating his Pokémon and even the player with respect. He is finally revealed to be the son of Team Rocket Boss Giovanni.
Wally (ミツル, Mitsuru): Another one of the rivals in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, and Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire is the player's protégé, Wally. In the beginning, he is a sickly young boy who needs help in catching a Pokémon. When he goes to the player's father for advice, Norman directs the player to help him catch a Pokémon. Using Norman's Zigzagoon, the player helps Wally catch a Ralts. The next time he battles the protagonist, he seems healthier and is in tune with his Pokémon. He battles the player for the last official time in Victory Road and waits there, always ready for another battle.
Barry (ジュン, Jun): The rival of Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. He is often impatient and is determined to be the best Trainer of all time. He is best friends with the player, and his father, Palmer, owns the Battle Tower in Sinnoh. Sometimes he will aid the player. He tends to accidentally crash into people quite often as he runs about.
Cheren (チェレン, Cheren): One of the rivals of Pokémon Black and White. Cheren is very intelligent and trustworthy; he often gives the player character advice and battles the player to test his skills. Like the player, he aims to become the Champion. He is one of the player's childhood friends. Two years later, in Black 2 and White 2, he becomes Aspertia City's Gym Leader. If the player used the Memory Link function in Black 2 and White 2, he challenges the player using his final team from Black and White. His name is from the Bulgarian word for black: черен (cheren).
Bianca (ベル, Bel): One of the rivals of Pokémon Black and White. Bianca is spontaneous and sometimes unreliable, but she develops over the course of the journey. She also has a strong side, which she shows when she goes on a Pokémon journey against her father's wishes. She is one of the player's childhood friends. Two years later in the events of Black 2 and White 2, Bianca becomes an assistant to Professor Juniper and gives the player their starter Pokémon. If the player used the Memory Link function in Black 2 and White 2, she challenges the player using her final team from Black and White. Bianca's name is from the Italian word for white, while her Japanese name "Bel" has the same meaning from Russian: бел (bel).
Hugh (ヒュウ, Hue): The rival of Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. He is from Aspertia City and one of the player's childhood friends. Like the player characters, and is also seeking to become a Pokémon Master. Throughout the game, the player helps Hugh retrieve his sister's Purrloin which was stolen by Team Plasma.
Shauna (サナ, Sana): One of the rivals and friends of Pokémon X and Y. She is energetic and curious, but still does not know what she wants to gain from her experiences. She gives the player character a nickname at the outset of their journey. Like the other rivals, she is available as a Multi Battle partner at the Battle Maison.
Trevor (トロバ, Trevor): One of the rivals and friends of Pokémon X and Y. He is studious and wishes to fill up all three parts of the Kalos Region's Pokédex.
Tierno (ティエルノ, Tierno): One of the rivals and friends of Pokémon X and Y. He is more interested in finding new Pokémon to make a perfect Pokémon Dance Team.
Hau (ハウ, Hau): One of the rivals of Pokémon Sun and Moon and Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Compared to previous rivals, he is more friendly.
Gladion (グラジオ, Gladio): One of the rivals of Pokémon Sun and Moon and Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. This young man lends his strength to Team Skull as an enforcer. He places a high value on being strong in Pokémon battles. His partner Pokémon is the mysterious Type: Null. He is Lusamine's son and Lillie's brother.
Trace (シン, Shin): The rival of Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!.
Hop (ホップ, Hop): The main rival in Pokémon Sword and Shield. He is the younger brother of Leon, the Champion of Galar.

Marnie (マリィ, Mary): One of the rivals in Pokémon Sword and Shield. Team Yell are her troublesome fans, and she is only seen using a Morpeko.


==== Pseudo-rival ====
The "pseudo-rival" in the video games debuted in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and is usually the character that the player did not choose to play as. They will appear in the game and will sometimes aid the player during their journey.

Brendan or May: The pseudo-rival in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire is either Brendan or May.

=== Gym Leaders ===

Gym Leaders (ジムリーダー, Jimu Rīdā) lead Pokémon Gyms, and offer Gym badges to Pokémon trainers who can defeat them. Usually, this challenge takes the form of a Pokémon battle, but, occasionally, the challenges are a trial of skill or endurance, or the badges are given in return for extraordinary services rendered.

In the anime, she is a cold, emotionless woman born with powerful psychic abilities, including telekinesis, telepathy, and transmutation, which she used in destructive ways as a child.

Team Galactic (ギンガ団, Ginga-dan, Galaxy Gang) first appear in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, being the evil team tormenting the region of Sinnoh. They desire to reshape time and space to their preferred designs by making the mythical Red Chain to control Dialga and Palkia (depending the game's version). They attempt create a new universe, kidnapping Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf for their plans. In Pokémon Platinum, they want both but are stopped when Giratina comes out of the Distortion World and drags everything back in with it. In the anime series, They are almost successful in creating a new universe, but are stopped when Ash and his friends destroy the red chains, forcing Cyrus to step into the "new universe" as it collapses. Later, Looker arrests Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Charon, causing Mars to exclaim that "... this is the end of Team Galactic."

Cyrus (Akagi (アカギ)): The leader of Team Galactic. Although it appears he wants to work with his team to create a new universe, he really wants to create the universe solely for himself, making it one devoid of emotions that he sees as weak and useless.An alternate version of himself appeared as a member of Team Rainbow Rocket. This Cyrus was successful in recreating the universe but was engulfed by a mysterious shadow during the moment of his victory and was transported to the game's world. He has Dialga (Ultra Sun)/Palkia (Ultra Moon) as part of his team.Mars (マーズ, Māzu): One of Team Galactic's commanders. She leads the group's actions at the Valley Windworks and also the assault at Lake Verity. In Platinum, she displays a dislike towards Charon and quits Team Galactic afterwards, looking to save Cyrus from the Distortion World.
Jupiter (ジュピター, Jupitā): One of Team Galactic's commanders. She leads the team at Eterna City's headquarters when they are investigating the city's Pokémon statue and the assault at Lake Acuity. In Platinum, after Mars quits, Jupiter decides to leave Team Galactic as well.
Saturn (サターン, Satān): One of Team Galactic's commanders. He leads the operations at Lake Valor as well as the group's headquarters in Veilstone City. After Cyrus's defeat, he decides to lead Team Galactic on a more virtuous mission of seeking alternative energy sources.
Charon (Pluto (プルート, Purūto)): One of Team Galactic's commanders, introduced in Platinum. He designs the devices that allow the group to control Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf and bring forth Giratina. He later tries to lead the group in obtaining the power of Heatran, but the player defeats him and he is arrested by Looker. The player can read his notes and it is hinted that he befriended the Rotom found near Eterna City.


===== Team Plasma =====
Team Plasma (プラズマ団, Purazuma-dan, Plasma Gang) is the antagonistic group in Pokémon Black and White who seeks to liberate Pokémon from humans. They are led by a boy known only as N and the Seven Sages who will capture Zekrom and Reshiram (depending on the game version), intending to use the Dragon Pokémon to force people to abandon capturing Pokémon. In reality, N is a pawn used by his adoptive father Ghetsis, one of the Seven Sages, who raised him for the sole purpose of being able to tame the legendary Pokémon and then disposing of him, so that he can take control of Unova. In Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, two years after Ghetsis's defeat and N's departure from Unova, Team Plasma reforms itself with its true intentions at the forefront, intending to use the power of Kyurem to take over the Unova Region and the rest of the world.

Ghetsis (G-Cis (ゲーチス, Gēchisu)): Ghetsis is the true leader of Team Plasma, and N's father, having raised the boy to serve as a charismatic leader while secretly running the true operations of the group behind the boy's back. For much of Black and White, he presents himself as a seemingly benevolent, well-meaning figure, but is steadily hinted at - and ultimately revealed as - the main villain of both sets of games and the main antagonist, rather than N. When N was only a child, Ghetsis kept him away from humans and closer to abused Pokémon, so that he would later develop resentment against humans who live side-by-side with their Pokémon and not realise how many good people actually existed. Because of this, Ghetsis was able to easily manipulate N into believing that he would be the "hero" that would help free all the Pokémon world from their owners. Afterwards, it is implied that Ghetsis planned to get rid of N once he had accomplished his mission: becoming the sole controller of Unova's Pokémon. However, the actions of the player - who has helped inspire N to see beyond his old views - lead to N's defeat. This infuriates Ghetsis, who reveals his true colors and attempts to stop the player himself. After his defeat he begins losing his mind, but retains enough clarity to escape with the help of his loyal servants, the Shadow Triad. In Black 2 and White 2, Ghetsis returns as the true leader of Team Plasma. When met, he will state that Kyurem is an empty shell, and that he will pour his ambitions into that shell. In Giant Chasm, he will command Kyurem to freeze the player alive with the Pokémon's signature move, Glaciate, but will be stopped by N. Unfortunately, he predicted that N's love for Pokémon will lead him to Kyurem and then merges Kyurem and Zekrom (Black 2) or Reshiram (White 2) to create Black Kyurem (Black 2) or White Kyurem (White 2), respectively. After Black/White Kyurem is defeated, Ghetsis then challenges the player to a battle. After losing, he loses the last of his sanity and the Shadow Triad move him away - later revealing that his mind has completely broken from the shock of his failures. His full name is Ghetsis Harmonia (ゲーチス・ハルモニア, Gēēchisu Harumonia, G-Cis Harmonia in Japanese).An alternate version of himself appeared as a member of Team Rainbow Rocket. This Ghetsis was successful in separating people and Pokémon. He has Zekrom (Ultra Sun)/Reshiram (Ultra Moon) as part of his team. Unlike the other leaders, refused to accept defeat. He threatened to harm Lillie, only for Colress of the game's world to appear and send him back to the world he came from.The Seven Sages (七賢人, Shichi Kenjin): The high-ranking members of Team Plasma. Throughout the course of the gameplay, the player encounters each of the sages but will not be able to battle them. After the defeat of N and before becoming the Pokémon Champion, the player must locate all of the Sages scattered throughout the Unova region. Ghetsis is the leader of the Seven Sages. The other Sages consist of:
Zinzolin (Vio (ヴィオ)): Associated with the color purple. He returns in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 under Ghetsis' Team Plasma, and battles the player at several points in the game. He is a specialist in Ice-type Pokémon, which is odd for someone who does not like the cold.
Ryoku (Ryokushi (リョクシ)): Associated with the color green.
Giallo (ジャロ, Jaro): Associated with the color yellow.
Rood (Rot (ロット, Rotto)): Associated with the color red. He returns in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 as part of the old Team Plasma, and is battled at their warehouse in Driftveil City. He seems to specialize in the Normal Type. He entrusts N's Zorua into the player's care, and assists the player at the Giant Chasm against Ghetsis' faction.
Bronius (Sumura (スムラ)): Associated with the color brown.
Gorm (Asura (アスラ)): Associated with the color blue.
The Shadow Triad ("Dark Trinity" (ダークトリニティ, Dāku Toriniti)): Three ninja-like young men who are Ghetsis's faithful servants because he once saved their lives. They have the ability to teleport, and usually "escort" the player to N or Ghetsis. After Ghetsis's defeat and arrest (and later unexplained break-out), the Shadow Triad appears one last time on the Marvelous Bridge, where they explain that Ghetsis ordered them to bring the player the 3 Orbs of Dialga, Palkia and Giratina (Adamant, Lustrous and Griseous, respectively) and that despite their loyalty to him, he has ordered them to not look for him. The Shadow Triad were once rumored to be the Striaton City Gym Leaders Cilan, Cress, and Chili. The Shadow Triad returns in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, and battles the player several times in the game. They are also revealed to possess a Liepard which had evolved from a Purrloin which was stolen from the rival character's younger sister five years earlier, leading him to foster a deep hatred for the organization. At first, this includes Rood's faction as well. After Team Plasma disbands, the Triad remains at Icirrus City, where they can be challenged on a monthly basis. Using the Unova Link Function unlocks a cutscene involving Cilan, Chili, and Cress fighting against The Shadow Triad (and losing) - thus disbanding the rumors that the two groups are one and the same.
N (エヌ, Enu): N is the king and leader of Team Plasma in Black and White. He is a very mysterious trainer who shows up at random and inconvenient times and believes that all humans and Pokémon should be separated. He is almost always seen using Pokémon that can only be found in the area that he is fought in. He was forced to grow up with abused Pokémon, as a plot by his adoptive father, Ghetsis, so that he would want to liberate all Pokémon from humans. By following through with the plan, he captures either Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White (the player will capture the opposite colored one) in order to show the world his power so that they will follow through with his plan to liberate all Pokémon. N returns in Black 2 and White 2 in a supporting role, enabling the games' mascot Kyurem to transform into its iconic form for the game version. In the end game, N can be challenged, using his legendary Pokémon from the previous game, and upon defeat the Dragon transforms into a Key Item the player can use to capture the Dragon himself or herself. After another in-game event, N becomes a character the player can challenge on a monthly basis, with the team changing with the games' seasonal cycle. His full name is Natural Harmonia Gropius (ナチュラル・ハルモニア・グロピウス, Nachuraru Harumonia Guropiusu).
Anthea (the Goddess of Love (愛の女神, Ai no Megami)) and Concordia (the Goddess of Peace (平和の女神, Heiwa no Megami)): Two characters who appear towards the end of the main story of Black and White who serve N. Concordia tells the player the story of N and how Ghetsis raised him, while Anthea heals the player's Pokémon in preparation for the final battle against N. They can also be seen in the game's first opening sequence where they watch as N is crowned as the king of Team Plasma by Ghetsis. It was revealed that Anthea and Concordia are N's foster Sisters. They appear in Black 2 and White 2 in Rood's Pokémon volunteer house in Driftveil City, where they tell the player of Ghetsis' ambitions and what he did to further them, as well as N's early childhood before Ghetsis found him. According to them, N had spent this part of his life in a forest with a Darmanitan and a Zorua (the latter of which can be acquired from Rood) as he had distressed people with an unusual ability to commune with Pokémon.
Colress (Achroma (アクロマ, Akuroma)): Colress is an independent Pokémon researcher and the new leader of Team Plasma in Black 2 and White 2, who works to learn about the powers of Pokémon and tries to bring out the true strength within them. He battles the player several times throughout the game to test the player's ability and the power of the player's Pokémon. He eventually aligns with Team Plasma, as they will allow him to study Pokémon the way he wishes. After Team Plasma is defeated, again, he helps the group reform their ways. He can then be battled at the P2 Laboratory. He has a larger antagonistic role in the anime, as he is building a device that would allow Ghetsis to control Reshiram, and he takes control of various Pokémon, including Team Rocket's Meowth, in an effort to fine tune it.


===== Team Flare =====
Team Flare (フレア団, Furea-dan, Flare Gang) is the evil team appearing in Pokémon X and Y. Their main goal is to "create a beautiful world", which eventually manifests itself into mass genocide of all human and Pokémon life but themselves, using an ancient weapon once used by a king of Kalos, an ancestor of their leader Lysandre, from 3000 years ago. While their plan involved harnessing the power of Xerneas and Yveltal (depending the game's version), Team Flare's scheme in the anime involves controlling Zygarde and the sundial as their weapon of holocaust

Lysandre (Fleur-de-Lis (フラダリ, Furadari)): The leader of Team Flare, seeking to attain eternal beauty. He follows the player's progress closely, seeking the player in his plans, and revealing the history of Kalos and the king AZ, his ancestor, who nearly wiped out all life. After his identity as Team Flare's leader is revealed, he admits that he wishes to use his ancestor's weapon to enact a mass extinction, believing the Mega Ring to be central to his plans. The player ultimately defeats Lysandre, and when Lysandre attempts to activate the weapon, despite the player having captured its power source Xerneas (X)/Yveltal (Y), the weapon crumbles and destroys the headquarters. Although the player and his/her friends, as well as most of the members of Team Flare, manage to escape, Lysandre is never seen escaping the destruction, therefore he is presumed dead.An alternate version of himself appeared as a member of Team Rainbow Rocket. This Lysandre was successful in Team Flare's plan but was blinded by a bright light at the moment the ultimate weapon was fired and ended up in the game's world. He has Xerneas (Ultra Sun)/Yveltal (Ultra Moon) as part of his team.I:n the anime, using Lysandre Labs as a front, Lysandre manipulates Alain to provide him with Mega Evolution while his subordinates managed to capture the blue-core Zygarde in his plan to control both Zygarde Cores while destroying Lumoise City as a display of Team Flare's power. But after losing to Ash, Alain, and a redeemed Malva, as well as losing both Zygarde Cores, Lysandre resorts to using a Zygarde fabrication created from the Megalith and have it absorb the energies of the Anistar sundial to invoke a global genocide. But the Zygarde Cores assume their 100% form to destroy the fabrication, with Lysandre seemingly killed in the process.

Aliana (Akebi (アケビ)): One of Team Flare's scientists. She leads the group in their infiltration of Kalos's Power Plant.
Bryony (Bara (バラ)): One of Team Flare's scientists. She and Celosia lead the group in their attack on the Poké Ball Factory.

===== Aether Foundation =====
The Aether Foundation is an organization appearing in Pokémon Sun and Moon seemingly dedicated to the conservation of Pokémon. However, it is revealed that they are also researching the Ultra Beasts and while they are not technically a criminal syndicate, their president sought to harness the power of Cosmog to bring the Ultra Beasts into Alola (in the original games)/travel to Ultra Megalopolis to battle Necrozma (in the Ultra versions) with no regard for the consequences of doing so.

Lusamine: The leader of the Aether Foundation, the mother of Lillie and Gladion, and the real villain of the original Sun and Moon games. She is obsessed with the Ultra Beasts, specifically the Nihilego species having fallen under their influence; Gladion speculates her fixation started after her husband vanished while studying them. She went as far as unleashing them upon Alola by overclocking Nebby's power before wanting to live a solitary life amongst the Nihilego in their home realm. She then ends up allowing herself to be taken over by a Nihilego at the games' climax in a last-ditch attempt to destroy the heroes (making her the only villain in the franchise whose final battle is fought against as a mutant version of themselves). While she is now living in Kanto to have the last of the Nihilego poison removed from her and trying to rebuild her relationship with Lillie, her ultimate fate in the original games remains unknown. However it is implied that she is now wanted by the International Police for her actions against Alola while she was possessed. The Ultra versions depict her in a completely different light; devoid of Nihilego's influence and therefore her Ultra Beast obsession, believing she's doing the right thing, working also with the Ultra Recon Squad and harnessing Nebby's power so that she can fight Necrozma, but is defeated easily by the stealer of light. She reforms at the end, giving her children the independence she had denied them for so long and choosing not to directly interfere with their lives anymore, but is captured by Team Rainbow Rocket and taken hostage in the post-game. After Team Rainbow Rocket's defeat, she then appears as a possible Title Defense challenger at the start of every month, a role previously taken by Faba (see below)
Faba: The Aether Foundation's admin. He challenges the player multiple times to stop the player when Lillie gets kidnapped. In the original games, he also appears as a possible fighter in Title Defense, appearing every start of the month, having been demoted from his position of Branch Chief. In the post-game story of the Ultra versions, he betrays the Aether Foundation to Team Rainbow Rocket for his own benefit. Because of this, he is demoted to the position of intern following Giovanni's defeat, with Lusamine taking his place in Title Defense in these games.
Wicke: The vice-chief of the Aether Foundation. Unlike the other two, she helps the player attempt to stop Lusamine's plans. She also appears in the post-game, helping the player with the Ultra Beast mission in the original versions.

Team Skull (スカル団, Skull-dan, Skull Gang) is a gang of street thugs who are the resident villain team of Alola, secretly working with the Aether Foundation on the promise of money. They were disbanded following the events of the games.

Guzma: Guzma is the boss of Team Skull and battles without mercy. He at one point went through the Island Challenge, but did not meet the criteria to become a Captain. He has history with Professor Kukui. He can be teamed up with at the Battle Tree in Double Battles, and in the Ultra versions, he helps the player defeat Team Rainbow Rocket out of his loyalty to Lusamine. After that, he appears as a possible Title Defense challenger.
Plumeria: Plumeria is Team Skull's admin and helps to keep the team in order. She cares for the grunts beneath her, making her less antagonistic than previous admins. She appears as a possible fighter in Title Defense.
Gladion: This young man lends his strength to Team Skull as an enforcer. He places a high value on being strong in Pokémon battles. His partner Pokémon is the mysterious Type: Null, which eventually evolves into Silvally. He is Lusamine's son and Lillie's brother. He also appears as a possible fighter in Title Defense and in the Ultra versions leaves Alola post-game to travel to other regions to become stronger; he appears as a Title Defense challenger after a month has passed in those games.

== Other characters ==


=== Professors ===
The Pokémon Professors give new Pokémon trainers a starting Pokémon appropriate to their region, and entrust them with a task (be it completing a Pokédex, delivering an object, or otherwise offering encouragement). They are also leading researchers of Pokémon-related topics, and mentor Pokémon trainers in a general way. It is interesting to note that almost all Pokémon Professors are named after trees or plants: Oak, Ivy, Elm, Birch, Rowan, Juniper, Sycamore, Kukui, Magnolia, Willow or Bellis.

Professor Samuel Oak (Professor Yukinari Ōkido (オーキド・ユキナリ博士, Ōkido Yukinari-hakase)): A Pokémon researcher and the grandfather of Blue/the rival in Pokémon Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen. He is often considered the leading Pokémon expert, often giving lectures to Pokémon academies and hosting a radio show in Goldenrod City, and specializes in Pokémon behavioral science. Alongside his research, he is also authorized by the Pokémon League to give new Pokémon trainers one of the three Kanto starter Pokémon: Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. In the anime, he gives Ash his Pikachu after Ash arrives too late to receive one of the usual three starter Pokémon. In Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition, he simply gives the player a Pikachu after the rival takes the Eevee that Oak intended to give the player. He is a master Pokémon poet. All Pokémon he "baby-sits" are loyal to him, and he had a Charmeleon as a young boy. In Pokémon 4Ever, it is shown that he traveled forward in time to the future when he was a boy, and Ash became friends with him. When Ash tells Professor Oak about him, he replies that he is sure that "Sammy" will always be his friend, even though Misty later realizes that Ash never told him his name; the current Professor Oak is later seen looking through a book of old drawings he made as a kid (the predecessor to the Pokédex, which he invented with the other professors).
Professor Felina Ivy (Professor Uchikido (ウチキド博士, Uchikido-Hakase)): A Pokémon researcher. She is the leading researcher in the Orange Islands. In the anime, she gives Ash the GS Ball to deliver to Kurt, which eventually leads him to the Johto region. Brock ends up staying with her during the Orange Islands saga of the anime, but parts ways with her after that saga, on unexplained painful or unpleasant terms.
Professor Elm (Professor Utsugi (ウツギ博士, Utsugi-hakase)): An absent-minded Pokémon researcher, and former student of Professor Oak. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, he is authorized by the Pokémon League to give new Pokémon trainers one of the three Johto starter Pokémon: Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. He is also credited as discovering that Pikachu is an evolved Pokémon. In the Pokémon anime, Jessie, James and Meowth temporarily steal a Totodile from him, (in reality he tells them to take it, thinking they are Nurse Joy). His 'absent minded professor' stereotype is even more pronounced in the games as he often forgets to visit his family and his wife worries that he may not remember to eat. He specializes in research regarding Pokémon breeding and is credited with the discovery of Pokémon eggs.
Professor Birch (Professor Odamaki (オダマキ博士, Odamaki-hakase)): A Pokémon researcher, known for his fieldwork and research on Pokémon habitual distribution. In Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire, he is authorized by the Pokémon League to give new Pokémon trainers one of the three Hoenn starter Pokémon: Treecko, Torchic, and Mudkip. He is the father of the rival character. In the anime, he gives May her Torchic. In the manga, he is the father of Sapphire.
Professor Krane (クレイン博士, Kurein-hakase): The Pokémon Professor in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. Prior to the game's events, he worked with the player character Michael's father to perfect the Shadow Pokémon purification process, resulting in the Purification Chambers which are crucial in purifying XD001, the game's Shadow Lugia. While he does not give Michael his Eevee, he does give Michael the Master Ball.
Professor Rowan (Professor Nanakamado (ナナカマド博士, Nanakamado-hakase)): The Pokémon Professor in the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, having returned to Sinnoh after four years of traveling abroad. A senior researcher to and old friend of Professor Oak, Professor Rowan is known for his research on Pokémon evolution.

Professor Hastings (Professor Shinbara (シンバラ教授, Shinbara-kyōju)): The Pokémon Professor in Pokémon Ranger. He invented the capture styler.
Professor Aurea Juniper (Professor Araragi (アララギ博士, Araragi-hakase)): The Pokémon Professor in the Pokémon Black and White games, the only female professor to appear in the video game series. Professor Juniper specializes in research involving the origins of Pokémon. She is authorized by the Pokémon League to give new trainers one of three Unova starter Pokémon, Snivy, Tepig, and Oshawott. In the game, she leaves a present at the player's house containing starter Pokémon for the player and the player's rivals, Bianca and Cheren. In the anime, she gives Trip a Snivy and allows Ash to keep an Oshawott that escapes from her lab.

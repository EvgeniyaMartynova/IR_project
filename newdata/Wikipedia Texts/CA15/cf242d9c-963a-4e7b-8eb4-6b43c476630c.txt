California's 15th congressional district

California's 15th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of California that covers most of eastern Alameda County including Castro Valley, Dublin, the northern part of Fremont, Hayward, 
Livermore, Pleasanton, Sunol,
Union City, and parts of Contra Costa County, including San Ramon and a portion of Danville.
The district is currently represented by Democrat Eric Swalwell.
As of 2018, the 15th congressional district is the 11th wealthiest district in the country.As a result of a redistricting initiative passed during the 2010 election, the northern parts of the former 15th District became part of the new 17th District, the middle parts were merged with most of the former 14th District to create the new 18th district, and the southern parts were merged with most of the former 16th District to create the new 19th District; the new 15th district occupies the areas around Union City, Hayward, and Livermore. This area was previously represented by the 13th district. The changes took effect in the 2012 elections.

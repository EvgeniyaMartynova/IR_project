== Critical reception ==
My Love Is Cool received positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews. Harriet Gibsone of The Guardian called the album "familiar but invigorating indie-rock", further stating: "while the foundations of My Love Is Cool are 90s/00s shoegaze and grunge, the London quartet defibrillate their influences with the ambition of youth. It also feels like an album that's been allowed time to gestate: despite being virtually veteran in buzzband terms, they have benefited from beefing up their sound on tour – as evidenced on the heavy romance of 'Your Loves Whore', the dirty degenerate chug of 'You're a Germ', or the cinematic 'Turn to Dust'. The awkward introversion in the lyrics – which deal with relationship strife, creepy blokes, friendship, gender and the quest for eternal love – add a sense of emotional overload driven by late nights, blood pacts and wide-eyed wonder. It's an invigorating debut with a gaunt, gallant identity of its own."Stephen Ackroyd of DIY praised the album, saying "My Love Is Cool isn't simply a great debut. It's not just a great album full stop. It's, in no uncertain terms, a remarkable one. The furthest from route one they could ever get, Wolf Alice aren't just sure of who they are; they own it." MusicOMH's Graeme Marsh said the album is "as good a debut as you could hope to hear, a fresh injection of pure brilliance and beauty to a genre that is creaking under the weight of mediocrity and a lack of adventurous inventiveness." AllMusic critic Heather Phares stated that "even if My Love Is Cool sacrifices some of Wolf Alice's earlier fury, the album is all the stronger for it." Neil McCormick of The Telegraph wrote, "They don't quite sound like the finished article, but there is a virtuous sense of their trying to make music in service of something profound." Pitchfork's Laura Snapes stated: "The confident diversity of My Love Is Cool indicates a band who have their own thing all figured out, who shouldn't veer from their own strange path to live up to outdated narratives that dictate what a young British band should be."

Villano de las Encartaciones

The Villano de Las Encartaciones (Basque: Enkarterriko billano, Cantabrian: Villanu, English: Butcher's dog of Las Encartaciones) is a Spanish working dog originated in Las Encartaciones, a comarca of the province of Biscay, in the Basque country, eastern Cantabria and northern Burgos. There are less than 100 of them in existence. The Villano derived from the Spanish Bulldog, of which it represents a lighter, faster and more agile version. The dog is used to catch Monchina cattle, which are raised in a feral state in northern Spain. The Villano is also used for boar hunting given its qualities as a catch dog. Males stand 60 to 65 cm at the shoulder and weigh up to 35 kg.

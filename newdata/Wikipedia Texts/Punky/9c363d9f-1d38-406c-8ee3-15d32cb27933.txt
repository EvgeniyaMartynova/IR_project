Punky Skunk

Punky Skunk is a platform game developed by Ukiyotei for the PlayStation. It was released in Japan by Visit in November 1996, and in North America by Jaleco in February 1998. The game was originally going to be released for the Super Famicom in early 1996 before being moved to PlayStation because of dying 16-bit markets.


== Promotion ==
A mascot resembling Punky Skunk appeared at the Famimaga Earth World 95.


== Gameplay ==
The player takes the role of an anthropomorphic skunk named Punky, who needs to save the world from the evil Wolf Pack. The game features a set of special tools at Punky's disposal, including a skunk spray, parasail, a pogo stick, inline skates, digging claws, and a snowboard. Besides the levels in the game, mini games are also featured which can benefit Punky in his adventures. It remains a collectors curiosity due to the generally unfinished nature of the game and the unfavorable reviews given at the time of release.


== Reception ==
Ryan Geddes of IGN considered the game and its English title to be equally bad. The titular character is ranked eighth on Game Informerâ€™s list of "the top 10 worst character names."Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that "Nuts to this - you might as well hook up your SNES and play Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel."

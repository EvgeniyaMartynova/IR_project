Commander Henry Hugh Gordon Dacre Stoker, DSO (2 February 1885 – 2 February 1966), commonly credited in films as H. G. Stoker  or Dacre Stoker, was a Royal Navy officer of the First and Second World Wars, and a stage and screen actor.

== Life ==
Stoker's naval career began in 1900 with training aboard HMS Britannia. He studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and, in July 1904, was promoted to sub-lieutenant. He volunteered for the Royal Navy Submarine Service. Aged 23 he was promoted to lieutenant, and his first submarine command. Later he was given responsibility to establish a submarine station on Gibraltar.
He served in the First World War as captain of the Australian Submarine AE2, which in 1915 was the first submarine to penetrate the mined narrows of the Dardanelles and thus to enter the Sea of Marmara.  After a series of naval engagements there, AE2 was attacked by the Ottoman torpedo boat Sultanhisar. The submarine was scuttled and the crew captured, with Stoker using his acting talents to entertain fellow prisoners and to attempt to escape, unsuccessfully. Leaving the navy in 1920 to act, he was recalled to active service at the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1945 he again left the navy to act.

General People's Congress (Libya)

The General People's Congress of Libya (Mu'tammar al-sha'ab al 'âmm) (Arabic: مؤتمر الشعب العام الليبي‎) was the national legislature of Muammar Gaddafi's Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya governance structure. It consisted of 2,700 representatives of the Basic People's Congresses. The GPC was the legislative forum that interacts with the General People's Committee, whose members are secretaries of Libyan ministries. It notionally served as the intermediary between the masses and the leadership and was composed of the secretariats of some 600 local "basic popular congresses." 
The GPC secretariat and the cabinet secretaries were appointed by the GPC secretary general and confirmed by the annual GPC session. These cabinet secretaries were responsible for the routine operation of their ministries.
The People's Hall, where the Congress met, was set on fire in the Libyan Civil War.

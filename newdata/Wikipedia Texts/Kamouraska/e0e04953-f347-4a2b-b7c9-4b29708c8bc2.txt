== Production and release ==
A slow-moving but beautiful film shot by cinematographer Michel Brault, it cost nearly $1 million, making it the most expensive Canadian film to date. Poorly reviewed by critics (it was edited to accommodate theatre owners; a two-hour restored version shows more artistic coherence), it was a modest commercial success in Canada and was not a major release in France and the United States.Henry Herx gave it a mixed review in his Family Guide to Movies on Video: "[T]he movie captures a vanished era, has excellent acting and the beauty of its settings[,] but its story of hot passion in a cold climate is heavily melodramatic."

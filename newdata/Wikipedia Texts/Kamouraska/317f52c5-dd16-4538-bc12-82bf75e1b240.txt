Kamouraska (provincial electoral district)

Kamouraska was a provincial electoral district in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region of Quebec, Canada.
It was created for the 1867 election (and an electoral district of that name existed earlier in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada and the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada).  It disappeared in the 1939 election and its successor electoral district was Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup; however, Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup existed for only that one election and disappeared in 1944, and was replaced by the re-created Kamouraska.
Its final election was in 1970.  It disappeared in the 1973 election and its successor electoral district was Kamouraska-Témiscouata.

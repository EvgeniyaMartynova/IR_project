Big Lagoon Rancheria

The Big Lagoon Rancheria is a federally recognized tribe of Yurok and Tolowa Indians. They are located in Humboldt County, California, and their tribal headquarters is in Arcata, California.


== Government ==
The tribe was first recognized by the US federal government on 10 July 1918. Tribal enrollment is based on a minimum of 1/8 blood quantum and lineal descent from the Plan of Distribution on the Assets of the Big Lagoon Rancheria, created January 3, 1968. The tribe has 24 enrolled members.


== Reservation ==
The Big Lagoon Rancheria was established in 1918. Their 20-acre (81,000 m2) reservation is adjacent to Big Lagoon, a beautiful waterway, located 30 miles (48 km) north of Eureka, California. It also lies adjacent to the unincorporated community of Big Lagoon, California. Eight households reside on the reservation. The tribe has been able to improve the local water facilities and road system on the reservation. As of the 2010 Census the population was 17.


== Economic development ==
Due to the highly sensitive environment of the reservation, the tribe has agreed with the state of California to not develop the reservation. Instead the tribe has partnered with the Los Coyotes Band of Cahuilla and Cupe√±o Indians to operate the Barstow Casino and Resort in Barstow, California.The historical Arcata Hotel in Arcata is owned and operated by the Big Lagoon Rancheria.

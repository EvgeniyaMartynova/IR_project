La Caravelle

La Caravelle is a restaurant and jazz venue in Marseille, France, situated on the first floor of the Hotel Belle Vue.  According to The Daily Telegraph it has "retained atmospheric pre-war elements – it was already a jazz bar in the 1930s – and boasts a tiny terrace affording cracking views over the Vieux Port. The atmosphere is part bodega, part maritime." Live jazz is performed on Wednesdays and Fridays from October through to May. 
In 2011 the restaurant was described by The Guardian: "The Caravelle is no simple bar or restaurant; it is a Marseille institution."

Movie Stars (TV series)

Movie Stars is an American sitcom television series that aired on The WB from 1999 to 2000.  It stars Harry Hamlin and Jennifer Grant as famous Hollywood actors trying to raise their children.


== Synopsis ==
Reese Hardin (Hamlin) was the star of over-the-top but high-grossing action films while Jacey Watts (Grant), his second wife, was an often-nominated dramatic actress. They lived in a fancy house in Malibu, California, (next door to Tom Hanks, who was never seen) and raising their children, Apache and Moonglow.  Also living with them were Reese's less successful brother Todd and Lori, Reese's daughter from his first marriage. Apache always tried to come up with marketing ideas for his parents; in the second season he worked to try to get Jacey the Oscar he felt she deserved. A running gag was that Todd's poker buddies were the less-successful brothers of John Travolta, Patrick Swayze, and Sylvester Stallone.

== Release ==
The track was set to be released as the album's fourth single on 21 July 2008, but was then pushed back many times for a release in November. It was to be released as a double A-side single with a cover of Bryan Ferry's 1985 song "Slave to Love" to coincide with its use in the Gucci Pour Homme advertising campaign.
On 4 December 2008, it was announced that the European and UK release of the single had been cancelled. Nevertheless, "Movie Star" was released digitally in the United States on 14 October 2008.


== Critical reception ==
Heather Phares of AllMusic referred to "Movie Star" as "Murphy's spin on Goldfrapp's glossy glam pop (and the only time she seems in danger of being overpowered by someone else's sound on the album)." Stephen Trouss of Pitchfork agreed, saying the song "laces itself a little too tightly into Alison Goldfrapp's glam pop corset." Digital Spy music editor Nick Levine, however, wrote that the song is "possibly Murphy's most immediate moment yet, a trancey dance-pop epic with a chorus that reaches for the stars. The lyrics, which tell the tale of an ambitious starlet desperate to 'break into cinema', are sharp and amusing too." Jax Spike from About.com viewed the track as "a departure in conception and more reminiscent of something closer to early 90s eurodance crossed with industrial which generates an urgent, grinding sound."


== Music video ==
The music video for "Movie Star" was directed by Simon Henwood and features Murphy on a night out in London with several drag queens and performers, including Jodie Harsh and Theo Adams. Some scenes are inspired by the work of John Waters, such as the attack by Lobstora from his 1970 film Multiple Maniacs and the appearance of Divine lookalikes.

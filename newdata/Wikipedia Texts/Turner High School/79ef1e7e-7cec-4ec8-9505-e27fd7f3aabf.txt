== History ==
Turner High School dates back to the 1920s. It is currently the only high school in the district. Turner High School was formerly located in the building that now houses the Turner Recreation Association. In the 1950s, it moved to a new building that now houses Turner Middle School. In the late 1990s, a bond issue was passed to build a new high school facility. After passing, the new Turner High School was built on a piece of land that was once a farm. The farm was torn down and in 2001, the new Turner High School opened its doors.

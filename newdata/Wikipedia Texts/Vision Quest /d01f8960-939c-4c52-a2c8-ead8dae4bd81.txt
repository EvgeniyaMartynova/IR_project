Vision Quest (album)

Vision Quest (released in the United Kingdom and Australia as Crazy for You) is a 1985 American coming-of-age romantic drama film starring Matthew Modine, Linda Fiorentino, Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. It is based on Terry Davis' 1979 novel of the same name. Modine plays a Spokane high school wrestler who falls in love with an older woman, an aspiring artist from New Jersey on her way to San Francisco.
The film includes an appearance by Madonna, her first in a major motion picture, playing a singer at a local bar, where she performs the songs "Crazy for You" and "Gambler".  In some countries, the title of the film was changed to market on Madonna's emerging fame and the popularity of the song "Crazy for You".


== Plot ==
Louden Swain is a high-school wrestler who has just turned 18 and decided that he needs to do something truly meaningful in his life. He embarks on a mission to drop two weight classes to challenge the area's toughest opponent, Brian Shute, a menacing three-time state champion from nearby rival Hoover High School, who has never been defeated in his high school career. In his zeal to drop from 190 pounds to 168 pounds, against the wishes of his coach and teammates, he disrupts the team around him and creates health problems of his own.
Meanwhile, his father has taken on a boarder named Carla from Trenton, New Jersey, passing through on her way to San Francisco. Though she is older, Louden falls in love with her and begins to lose sight of his goals as a wrestler. Worse, his drastic weight loss culminates in an unhealthy situation in which he gets frequent nosebleeds due, Louden claims, to a lack of iron in his diet (which costs him a match that he should have won). The two finally admit their love for each other, but Carla realizes she is distracting him from his goals. She decides to move out and continue on to San Francisco, but not before seeing Louden's big match in which he pins Shute in the final seconds with a lateral drop.

Jack Galbraith

John McDonald "Jack" Galbraith (born 4 April 1898, date of death unknown) was a Scottish professional footballer. He was born in Renton, West Dunbartonshire.
Galbraith began his career playing junior football at Vale of Leven and Shawfield before signing for Clapton Orient in 1921. He went on to spend a decade at the club, making 277 league appearances, before joining Cardiff City in February 1931. He was signed as a replacement for the club's FA Cup-winning captain Fred Keenor, but was unable to stop the club's slide as they fell into the Third Division South. He left the club in 1935 to manage Milford United, before later returning to Clapton Orient as a coach. Between 1936 and 1938, and for a short spell in 1939, Galbraith managed French side RC Lens.

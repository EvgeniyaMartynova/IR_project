Galbraith would step down from this position on February 14, 1861 after being appointed the sixth Florida Attorney General by Governor John Milton.

Though his predecessor, Mariano D. Papy, was appointed to the council, Galbraith was not, weakening his power. Despite this, Galbraith still had a crucial role in boosting Florida's wartime economy. Galbraith instructed the trustees of Florida's Internal Improvement Fund to cancel construction of the St. Johns-Indian River Canal, as funds needed to be diverted to help the war effort. Additionally, Galbraith oversaw the reformation and consolidation of the Florida state militia, which he saw as flawed and imperfect.Galbraith continued to serve as Florida's Attorney General through the end of the war and for a part of Reconstruction.

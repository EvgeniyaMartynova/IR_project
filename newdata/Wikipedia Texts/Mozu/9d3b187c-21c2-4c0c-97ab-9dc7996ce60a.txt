Nakamozu Station

There are two railway stations named Nakamozu (中百舌鳥駅, Nakamozu-eki) in Nakamozuchō Nichō, Kita-ku, Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, Japan.  One is on the Nankai Koya Line and the Semboku Rapid Railway, and the other is on the Osaka Metro Midosuji Line.
The name of the station is difficult to read in kanji, as well as Abiko Station and Namba Station on the Osaka Metro Midosuji Line. The subway station shows the name in hiragana (なかもず) for information, but uses kanji for the official station name. The Semboku Rapid Railway Line uses both kanji and hiragana (中もず) on the destination signs at the stations and on the destination displays on the trains.

Robert Leslie Thomas Galbraith

Robert Leslie Thomas "R.L.T." Galbraith (1841 â€“ May 1924) was an Irish-born merchant and political figure in British Columbia. He represented Kootenay in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1877 to 1886.
He was born in Raphoe, County Donegal, the son of Professor Galbraith, of Scottish descent, and was educated at the Royal College there. In 1870, he came to Fort Steele on the Kootenay River, at that time known as Galbraith's Ferry, to join his brother John who was operating a ferry and general store there. Galbraith was first elected to the assembly in an 1877 by-election held following the death of William Cosgrove Milby. He was chairman of the assembly's Committee of Ways and Means and Supplies. Galbraith later served as justice of the peace and was Indian agent for the southeast part of the province. He became known as the "Grand Old Man of the Kootenays". In 1913, at the age of 72, Galbraith married Ella Fleming, a 39-year-old woman from England.

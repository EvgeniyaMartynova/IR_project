Ǝ

Ǝ ǝ or Turned E is an additional letter of the Latin alphabet used in African languages using the Pan-Nigerian alphabet or the African reference alphabet. The minuscule is based on a rotated e and the capital form majuscule Ǝ, based on a rotated majuscule E.
It is not to be confused with U+2203 ∃ THERE EXISTS, the existential quantifier used in logic, or with U+0259 ə LATIN SMALL LETTER SCHWA (uppercase Ə), which is used as a phonetic symbol and as a letter in languages of Central Asia.

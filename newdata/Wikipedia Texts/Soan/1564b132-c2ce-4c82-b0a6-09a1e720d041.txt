Soan (singer)

Julien Decroix, better known as Soan, (born on 4 May 1981) is a French singer-songwriter who won in 2009 the seventh series of the French music competition Nouvelle Star.


== Beginnings ==
Soan left home at 17 over family discords and traveled a lot as a singer to earn his living but without notable success. He also sang at Paris Metro underground train stations.


== Nouvelle Star ==
At 27, he took part in the Paris auditions of Nouvelle Star (French version of Idol) and was accepted to qualification rounds, without his audition being shown on the program. His rendition in the second round was also not shown. His first showing on the broadcast series was while doing a trio interpretation of BB Brunes's Dis-moi with two other candidates after which went to the lives rounds. On the show of 31 March 2009 on M6, judge Philippe Manœuvre announced his selection for the prime shows with 15 finalists left.
On 9 June 2009, he was declared the winner against tough competition from finalist and eventual runner-up Leïla Aissaoui as well as from third Camélia Jordana. He proved to be a phenomenon with his piercings and tattoos, pretty face, smoky eye makeup (l'oeil de biche), deep baritone voice and unique sense of fashion. Jean Paul Gaultier designed several of Soan's costumes and outfits.

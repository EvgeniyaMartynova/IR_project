Cape Turnagain

Cape Turnagain is a prominent headland on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, part way between Hawke Bay and Cook Strait, between the mouths of the Porangahau and Akitio Rivers.The cape was named by Captain James Cook in 1769. On his journey of discovery, he sailed south to this point where he was met with atrocious conditions, typical of the area. Being unable to safely proceed, he decided to turn and head north around New Zealand and named the point as a result of his decision.
Cape Turnagain is 650 kilometres (400 mi) north-west of Chatham Island, making it the nearest point of mainland New Zealand to Chatham Island.
There is another Cape Turnagain or Point Turnagain on the Kent Peninsula in Arctic Canada.

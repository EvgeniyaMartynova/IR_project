Vitamin C (song)

"Vitamin C" is a song by the krautrock band Can on their 1972 album Ege Bamyasi. Considering its short length and relatively standard song structure, it is one of the band's more conventional songs.It was featured in Samuel Fuller's German television Tatort production Kressin & die tote Taube auf der Beethovenstra√üe (Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street) in 1973, and then also released as a single with the B-side "I'm So Green".
In 1997, an 8-minute version of the song, remixed by British musical outfit U.N.K.L.E., was featured on Can's double remix album Sacrilege.
Vitamin C was featured in the opening of Paul Thomas Anderson's 2014 film Inherent Vice.
An interpolation of a keyboard sample from the song was used in Brooklyn band Woods' 2016 song "Can't See at All".
The song was also featured as the theme song for Jaden Smith's character 'Dizzee' throughout the Netflix series The Get Down.
In 2018 the DJs Adam Beyer & Bart Skils released their track "Your mind" which features the famous songtext "Hey you! You're losing, you're losing..." but instead of "vitamin C" the lyrics were altered to "your mind".
In JoJolion, the eighth part of the long-running Manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Damo Tamaki's stand, "Vitamin C", is named after the song. The character of Damo Tamaki is also a reference to Damo Suzuki.

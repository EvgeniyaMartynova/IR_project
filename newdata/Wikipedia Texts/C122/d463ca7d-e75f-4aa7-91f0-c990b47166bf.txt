Chadwick C-122

The Chadwick C-122 was a single-seat ultralight helicopter developed in the United States in the 1980s. It was a minimalist design consisting of a fibreglass shell enclosing a truss structure to which the engine, rotor mast, landing gear, and pilot's seat were attached. A wide variety of roles were envisaged for the aircraft, and therefore it was equipped with attachment points for spray bars, a cargo hook, external cargo racks, and even weapons for law enforcement work. The skid-type undercarriage could be quickly fitted with wheels for ground-handling, or floats for operations from water.
A prototype was constructed in 1985, and publicly unveiled at the Helicopter Association International annual convention the following year. Flight testing continued through 1987, with deliveries anticipated for that Autumn.

Big Sur (Jack Johnson song)

== Release ==

== Composition ==
The song was written by Johnson for his wife Kim, which is his 15th love song to her. The song is not only a love song to Kim, but a song that is made to make you focus on other things other than the first five songs talked about. The first five songs talked about issues such as pollution, Climate change, and politics. The song describes fun times surfing and at the beach, and was written while Johnson was on a surfing trip. Johnson described the full meaning of the song on an interview at CNN and said "driving away from all those things that can load up on your mind and weigh heavy on you. Big Sur is about escaping all of that. In the song, I refer to the lines of the road driving up â€” but it's also the lines of society that confine us. Big Sur is one of those places for me where you can find freedom."


== Recording ==
The song was recorded at Jack Johnson's studio called "The Mango Tree" in Hawaii just after the 2016 United States presidential election. It was produced by long time companion Robbie Lackritz, and was a mostly pure song with little to no post production.

Jack Johnson performed the song live on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on September 9, 2017. The song was played prior to the album release several times during Jack's All the Light Above It Too Tour, and has been played a total of 12 times in concerts.

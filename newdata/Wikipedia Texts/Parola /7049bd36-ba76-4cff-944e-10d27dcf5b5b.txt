== Career ==

Parola is mostly known for his time with Juventus with whom he played over 300 games between 1939 and 1954, winning two Serie A titles and a Coppa Italia, and even serving as the club's captain from 1949 onwards. He also had brief spells with Lazio and Midland in Argentina, before going into management. At international level, he was capped for Italy on 10 occasions between 1945 and 1950, and represented his country at the 1950 FIFA World Cup.As a coach, he managed several Italian clubs throughout his career, and had spells with Anconitana, Juventus, Livorno, and Novara. He won the Serie A title during his second spell as Juventus's coach in 1975, a title he had previously also won as a player for the club.


== Style of play ==
A quick, mobile, hard-working, versatile, and powerful player, with good technique, Parola was capable of playing both as a defender and as a defensive midfielder, due to his strength, stamina, and man-marking, which led him to be regarded as one of Italy's greatest defenders. An agile player, he was also known for his skill in the air, and ability to score goals with acrobatic strikes, from volleys and bicycle kicks; indeed, during the 1940s, he popularised the use of the bicycle kick in Italy, earning the nickname Signor Rovesciata ("Mr. Overhead Kick"), and was even credited with its invention by the Italians.

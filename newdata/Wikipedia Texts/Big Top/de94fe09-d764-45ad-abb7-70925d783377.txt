Big Top (video game)

Big Top is a circus-themed platform game for the IBM PC family of computers, written by Michael Abrash and published by Funtastic in 1983. The game was distributed on a self-booting disk.


== Gameplay ==

Big Top features a circus "big top" theme. The user plays the part of a clown with the job of gathering all the hats on each ladder-filled levelâ€”where, in keeping with the theme, levels are called rings. Each ring spans across at least two screens and has an upper and lower level. Obstacles include evil clowns, cannons, and rolling barrels.

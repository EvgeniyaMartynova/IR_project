The venue was originally proposed in 1999 by Metro Edgley Pty Ltd. Known as Luna Circus, the building was proposed as a venue for circus acts and a possible site for a permanent Cirque du Soleil show. Plans were underway to begin construction in 2000, opening in 2001. However, the proposal was not approved by the North Sydney Council until December 2002. Construction began in February 2003 and was completed in December. It was built on the site of the former Ghost Train
An opening celebration concert was held 2 April 2004. It was hosted by Simon Burke and featured performances by Caroline O'Connor, Marina Prior and David Campbell.

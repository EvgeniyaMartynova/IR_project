Wells Fargo Building (Augusta)

The Wells Fargo Building, formerly known as the Wells Fargo Bank Center, is a commercial and financial skyscraper in Augusta, Georgia, in the United States. After its completion, the building was the tallest building in Augusta from 1967 to 1976, when the Lamar Building surpassed it due to the completion of the penthouse. Today, it is the third tallest building in the city. The building's exterior surface is made completely in aluminum steel glass. At the time of its completion, the building was named the Georgia Railroad Bank & Trust. In 1989, the building's name was changed to the Wachovia Bank Center, making it the official headquarters of Wachovia in the eastern part of Georgia and the Central Savannah River Area. In 2008, the building's name was changed again to the Wells Fargo Building. It is now the official headquarters of Wells Fargo in the Augusta region.

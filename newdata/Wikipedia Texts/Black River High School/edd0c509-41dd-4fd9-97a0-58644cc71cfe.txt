Black River Public School (Holland, Michigan)

Black River Public School is a college preparatory charter school located in Holland, Michigan.


== History ==
One of Michigan's earliest charter schools, Black River Public School was founded on July 1996 after receiving a charter from Grand Valley State University. Its operations initially took place in the Federal School building on 8th Street and during its four years there, 14 portables were added due to growth. Due to the overcrowding, BASF Corporation donated a 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) building, originally occupied by the Holland Furnace Company, to the school in 1998.In 2001, Black River added a Montessori elementary program.
In May 2003, Black River was accredited by the American Academy for Liberal Education (AALE) and in 2004 by the North Central Association Commission of Accreditation and School Improvement.In the summer of 2003, Black River added two new 8 and 6 room modular buildings to accommodate more elementary students.
In the spring of 2007, Black River completed construction of a new 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) facility housing a gymnasium, lyceum (cafeteria), and music facilities.  Previously existing facilities were remodeled to provide additional classroom space.
In the fall of 2011 remodeling was completed on a former storage/loading dock facility to house the kindergarten program following its transition to an all-day schedule.
In 2014 the school undertook a $4.87 million capital campaign to raise funds for a four part capital project benefiting the entire student body.  Improvements included a new 27,000 sf elementary facility (built during the summer of 2015), a building renovation for a new chemistry lab, supplemental gym/cafeteria space, and significant technology upgrades throughout campus.  The project was completed successfully with the new buildings opening in the fall of 2015, growing enrollment to nearly 1,000 students in grades K-12.

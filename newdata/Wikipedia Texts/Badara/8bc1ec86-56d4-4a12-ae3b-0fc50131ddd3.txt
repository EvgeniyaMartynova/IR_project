Badaratittha

Badara Tittha Vihara (also Badaratittha, Padaratittha ) is the name of an historic Theravada Buddhist vihara in what is now the modern Tamil Nadu state of India.


== In the Gandhavamsa ==
Badaratittha is known to us from the Gandhavamsa (or Cullagandhavamsa), a 17th-century Pali work by Nandapañña that recounts post-canonical Pali books written in Burma and Ceylon.
The Gandhavamsa states that Badara Tittha Vihara was the dwelling place of Ācariya Dhammapāla, an early Theravadin commentator from Kanchipuram.

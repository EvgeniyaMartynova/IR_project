Black River Bridge (Pocahontas, Arkansas)

The Black River Bridge carries U.S. Route 67 (US 67) (Future Interstate 57 {I-57}) across the Black River in Pocahontas, Arkansas. The bridge is a twin span, each carrying two lanes of traffic. The northern bridge was a historic structure, built in 1934 by the Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2016 demolition began on the northern bridge, and it was delisted in 2018. This bridge consisted of two Parker trusses, one on either side of a Warren swing span, and trestled approaches, giving it a total length of 1,255 feet (383 m). It was one of three surviving swing bridges in the state. The southern bridge is a modern steel girder structure, built in 1986, whose construction rendered the swing section inoperative.

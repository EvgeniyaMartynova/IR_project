== History ==
Elk Mountain opened in 1959.  The ski area provided a small lodge, a 2,200 ft (670 m) T-Bar ski lift, tow rope lifts and a small number of trails. In 1961 a double chair lift was installed, allowing for additional trails. A year later, in 1962, snowmaking was added along with a new A-frame lodge at the base of the mountain. Night skiing came to Elk Mountain in 1966—expanding to more trails in 1972. Elk Mountain built a 4,000-foot-long (1,200 m) long quad chairlift in 1994.


== Skiing at Elk Mountain ==

North Chair at Elk Mountain accesses a top elevation of 2,667 ft (813 m)—the highest lift-serviced skiing in eastern Pennsylvania.  Elk has a 925 ft (282 m) vertical drop, 27 trails  (six greens, 10 blues and 11 diamonds) and two terrain parks.   Five double chair lifts and a fixed-grip quad chair lift provide access to the top of the mountain. Four of the lifts, including the quad, run from the base to just below the summit of the mountain. Most ski runs are groomed, but a few are allowed to bump up, or become moguled, to allow for additional challenge. The mountain receives, on average, 5 feet of natural snow per season. Snowmaking covers 100% of the 180 acres (73 ha) of skiable terrain. The base complex features a day lodge, guest services, ski school center, restaurant, rentals, and a ski-and-snowboard shop.

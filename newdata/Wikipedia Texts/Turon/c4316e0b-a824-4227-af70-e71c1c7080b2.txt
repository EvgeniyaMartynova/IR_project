Turon (food)

Turon (Tagalog pronunciation: [tuˈɾɔn]; Spanish: turrón de banana or turrón de plátano), also known as lumpiang saging (Filipino for "banana lumpia"), is a Philippine snack made of thinly sliced bananas (preferably saba or Cardaba bananas), dusted with brown sugar, rolled in a spring roll wrapper and fried. Other fillings can also be used together with the banana, most commonly jackfruit (langka), and also sweet potato, mango, cheddar cheese and coconut.
Turon is a popular snack and street food amongst Filipinos. These are usually sold along streets with banana cue, camote cue, and maruya.
In Malabon, the term "turrón" or "turon" instead refers to a fried, lumpia-wrapper-enveloped dessert filled with sweet mung bean; while valencia is used for the banana-filled variety. Malabon banana turon are generally sold as valencia trianggulo, which are uniquely triangle-shaped.

Welcome to the Wasteland (Logan album)

Welcome to the Wasteland is the second album from Logan. Initially planned as just an EP, it grew in length and is now considered to be a full album. Track six, "Like A Rain", is a re-recorded version of the song from First Leaf Fallen, Logan's first album that has since been pulled out of circulation. The piano part on "Hey Mary" was played by Paul Gallagher, who had previously collaborated with Logan.

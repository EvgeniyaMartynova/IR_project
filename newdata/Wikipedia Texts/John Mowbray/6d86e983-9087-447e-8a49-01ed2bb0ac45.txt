== Early life ==
Mowbray was born in Springwood and played his junior rugby league with the Guildford Owls in the Parramatta district.

== Playing career ==
Mowbray made his first grade debut for Wests against Manly at Pratten Park in 1959.  Mowbray did not feature for Western Suburbs in either the 1961 or 1962 grand final defeats to St George but was a member of the 1963 grand final side which lost to St George 8-3.  The grand final is widely remembered for the muddy conditions during the match and the photograph of Norm Provan and Arthur Summons which was taken at full time.  This would be the last grand final that Western Suburbs would play in as a stand alone entity until they exited the competition in 1999.  Mowbray played a further five seasons for Wests and retired at the end of 1968.

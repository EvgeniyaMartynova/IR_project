St Canice (Parliament of Ireland constituency)

St Canice, also called Irishtown, was a constituency represented in the Irish House of Commons from the 1661 until 1800. Irishtown was a borough within the parish of St Canice in the county of the city of Kilkenny. The borough was separate from the city itself, which was represented by Kilkenny City constituency.
The borough was disfranchised by the Acts of Union 1800. Compensation for the loss of the patronage was awarded in the standard amount of £15,000. The claim of Hugh Hamilton, Bishop of Ossory to this compensation was disallowed; instead it went to the Commissioners of First Fruits.

Kamiakin High School

Kamiakin High School is a public high school in Kennewick, Washington, the second of three comprehensive high schools in the Kennewick School District.  Kamiakin opened in the fall of 1970 and serves the district's northwest portion.  The school colors are scarlet and gold and the mascot is the Braves.


== Overview ==
The school is named after Kamiakin, a chief of the Yakama Tribe in the 19th century and a leader of the American Indian side in the Yakama War.
Kamiakin went through a remodel from 2002–04 that added 15 new classrooms, a new gymnasium and converted the existing lecture hall into an auditorium capable of seating 600 people as well as updating safety to meet standards throughout the campus.


== Academics ==
Kamiakin is generally considered to be one of the highest ranked public high schools in all of southeastern Washington of size 3A or 4A (along with Hanford High School in nearby Richland) and is ranked among the top 1,500 best high schools in the nation by Newsweek.  Kamiakin's four year graduation rate is 89.4% and 92.4% after five years, around 13% higher than the state average.


=== Testing ===
In 2014, 511 AP Exams were given, with 87% of students enrolled in one or more AP classes electing to take an exam. (Kamiakin is subsidizing AP tests starting in the 2015–2016 school year. Some teachers do require an AP test as a portion of the class.  Each student may choose whether or not to take the test and must pay the reduced price should he or she decide to take it.)
The school's HSPE (High School Proficiency Exam) scores annually rank higher than district and state averages with a passing rate around five percent higher than the state average in both reading and writing.


=== Running Start ===
Running Start is a program offered to Kamaiakin students, as well as other Washington State students, in grades 11 and 12.  Kamiakin Running Start students get the opportunity to earn both high school and college credits from college courses taken at the nearby Columbia Basin College in Pasco, Washington.  Students do not pay tuition, but they are required to pay mandatory fees, buy their own books, and provide their own transportation.


=== Post Graduation ===
In 2014, 67% of Kamiakin graduates continued their education immediately after high school, 72% after two years, at a postsecondary school, 5% higher than the state average.  Of the 67% choosing to further their education 84% choose to do so in state, 49% of whom choose to attend Columbia Basin College.


== Athletics ==
The school has 19 varsity teams, 12 junior varsity teams and nine "C" teams.
Kamiakin's football and soccer teams play their home games at Neil F. Lampson Stadium, while a majority of the other varsity sports compete on campus.


=== Classification ===
Kamiakin competes in WIAA Class 3A, with the state's second largest group of schools.
Kamiakin is one of eight schools in the hybrid 3A/4A Mid-Columbia Conference, along with Chiawana, Hanford, Kennewick, Pasco, Richland, Southridge, and Walla Walla high schools.  Kamiakin is one of only seven schools with the 3A classification in the state's Yakima Valley District Five, which includes Benton, Kittitas, Klickitat and Yakima counties.


=== Rivalries ===
Kamiakin's biggest rivals in most sports are Southridge High School in southwest Kennewick and Kennewick High School in east Kennewick.  In football, the annual game with the much larger 4A Pasco High School ranks as one of the fiercest among high school rivalries in the state.

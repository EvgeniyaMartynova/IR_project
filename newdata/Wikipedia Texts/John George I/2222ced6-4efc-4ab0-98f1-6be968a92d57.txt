John George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau

George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (c.  1390 – 21 September 1474), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Dessau. He was the second son of Sigismund I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his wife Judith, daughter of Gebhard XI, Count of Querfurt.


== Life ==
In 1405, after the death of his father, George inherited the principality of Anhalt-Dessau alongside his older brother Waldemar IV and his younger brothers Sigismund II and Albert V. By 1435, he adopted the style "Lord of Zerbst and Dessau" and styled himself "Lord of Köthen" from 1460.
In 1468 he inherited the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg, then three years later (in 1471) signed a succession contract with his first cousin Adolph I, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, that named him as "Mitherr" (co-ruler) with rights to half of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen. George renounced his rights, however, in favor of his eldest son Waldemar VI, who became the new co-ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen. The deaths of George's brothers between 1417-1469 without male heirs left him as the sole ruler of Anhalt-Dessau until his own death, which occurred in Dessau.

Villingili (Alif Dhaal Atoll)

Alifu Dhaalu Atoll (also known as Southern Ari Atoll or Ari Atholhu Dhekunuburi) is an administrative division of the Maldives. 
The separation of Ari Atoll (formerly Alifu Atoll) on March 1, 1984, into a Northern and a Southern section formed the two most recent administrative divisions of the Maldives, namely Alifu Alifu Atoll  and Alifu Dhaalu Atoll. Alifu Dhaalu Atoll lies south of the line between the channels of Himendhoo Dhekunukandu and Genburugau Kandu.
There is an ancient mosque in Fenfushi island having wooden decorated ceilings and lacquerwork panels. 
Buddhist remains, including a stupa, have been found in Ariadhoo Island.
Whale sharks are year-round residents of Alif Dhaal Atoll.

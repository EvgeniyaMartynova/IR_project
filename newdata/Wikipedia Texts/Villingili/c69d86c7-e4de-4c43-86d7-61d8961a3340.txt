Villingili (Gaafu Alif Atoll)

Villingili (Dhivehi: ވިލިނގިލި) is one of the inhabited islands of Gaafu Alif Atoll.


== History ==
In former times, Vilingili boat owners used to decorate their fishing boats with rich and varied decorative patterns. This practice was discontinued in the 1970s.


=== Archaeology ===
According to Mr. Ibrahim Lutfi there was a mound in an area of the island that has been eroded away by the currents on the reef. This mound was probably an ancient Buddhist stupa.

Traditionally this island is also known as 'Huvadu Atoll Vilingili'.

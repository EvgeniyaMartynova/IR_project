Ordine Nero

The Ordine Nero (Italian: Black Order) was an Italian militant fascist group founded in 1974 following the government's dissolution of the right-wing Ordine Nuovo. Between 1974 and 1978, bombings by ON led to a number of woundings and one death, and the group assassinated Assistant State Attorney Vittorio Occorsio, a prosecutor in the trial to dissolve the Ordine Nuovo, in 1976.


== History ==
Ordine Nero has simply adopted the ideologies of Ordine Nuovo. For the members of the neo-fascist Ordine Nero, ultimate goal was to destroy liberal-democratic state in order to clear the way for the fascist one. Democratic state was assailed by the neo-fascists for its weakness, its alleged tolerance of Communists in parliament, dark-skinned immigrants in the labor force, and Jews in positions of power and influence. The neo-fascists belonging to Ordine Nero believed that the nation's survival is dependent upon the exorcism of these three elements; only by becoming politically, racially, and culturally homogeneous can the state recover its strength and again work for its natural citizens and not a variegated collection of interlopers. Regardless of their ultimate goal, they did not appeared to have any specific program of reform, instead, to espouse vague national socialist slogans of nationalism, racial purity, and governmental strength. Ordine Nero operated alongside like-minded groups like "Movimento Armato Rivoluzionario", "Terza Posizione", and "Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari". Many of
these groups existed in name only. Like their counterparts on the left, right-wing terrorists staged different operations under different names in order to give the impression of size and strength.An ongoing controversy over the group is its role in any strategy of tension endorsed by elements of the Italian government or NATO. Bomber Vincenzo Vinciguerra alleged that the Italian security services and the "Atlantic Alliance", particularly the United States, had a role in the group's activities.

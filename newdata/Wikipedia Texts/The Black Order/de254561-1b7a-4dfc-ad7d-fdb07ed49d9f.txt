== Concept ==
"The Myth of the Holy Sword" presents the history of the Emerald Sword in the Emerald Sword Saga. During the third Elvish war in the battle for Galfor's mines, the warrior Naimur was captured by Atlon (referred to as "Hell's Fury"). Atlon tortured Naimur using an emerald stone to drain his energy and eventually killed him. After the battle, Loinir, Naimur's brother, took the stone used to torture Naimur and forged the Emerald Sword. Loinir asked the angels to bless the sword, filling it with their holy might.
Some years later, the Elves launched a new attack against Atlon and his forces, giving Loinir the chance to avenge his brother. "just a strike of the sword, [was] hell's last breath". Loinir felt as though the blade was too powerful, and thus he gave it to the wizards to examine. The wizards determined that the sword had indeed been enchanted with holy powers and that it could be dangerous if it fell into the wrong hands. They therefore hid the sword beyond the Ivory Gates.

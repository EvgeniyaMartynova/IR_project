Sobat was born in Calgary, Alberta of first-generation Ukrainian-Canadian and Serb-Canadian parents. A striking Drumheller miner with socialist sympathies, her Ukrainian grandfather had been blacklisted by the RCMP in his youth; her Depression-era parents maintained socialist leanings throughout their lives.
She spent her early years in Drumheller, then Shouldice, and on the Blackfoot Indian Reservation, now Siksika Nation, near the hamlet of Gleichen. She attended kindergarten at the Old Sun Residential School, and later in St. Paul, near the Saddle Lake Cree Nation. Her father worked with Indian Affairs. Sobat completed Education and Arts degrees and a master's degree in English at the University of Alberta in Children's Literature, specializing in fantasy.

Courses offered include traditional poetry and fiction classes, but also drumming and words, movement and words, playwriting, journalism, illustration, writing for radio, screenwriting, and songwriting. The camp runs each January and July, and is overseen by Sobat, a team of supervisors, and a slate of professional authors and illustrators. 2015 marked the inaugural year for JustWrite, a writing camp for adults.

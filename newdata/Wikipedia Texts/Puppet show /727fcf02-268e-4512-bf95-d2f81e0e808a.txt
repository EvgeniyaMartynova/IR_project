== Opus numbers ==
Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi provides this list of works with opus numbers, compiled by the composer, prefaced by the following remarks (italics added): "The other catalogue which was sent to Stassof is dated 16 August 1878; but, as it mentions no work composed later than 1874, Andrei Rimsky-Korsakof suggests, rightly, that it must have been compiled some four years earlier. Its only value is that of a biographical curiosity."
Note: The columns 'category' and 'notes', as well as the column headings, have been added for the convenience of the reader. It will be noticed that Calvocoressi's date given in the preceding remarks (16 August 1878) does not match that given below.

"To Vladimir Vassilievitch Stassof in memory of Mussorianin26 August '78, Petrograd

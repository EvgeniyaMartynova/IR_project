Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal

The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN, Nepali: नेपाल नागरिक उड्डयन प्राधिकरण, Nepāl Nāgarik Uḍḍayan Prādhikaraṇ), an independent Nepali government body since 1998, is headquartered in Kathmandu.The CAAN began in 1957 as an agency under what was the Ministry of Work, Communications and Transport. On 31 December 1998, as a result of the Civil Aviation Act of 1996, the CAAN was established as an independent regulatory body. It is the board which issues new pilot licenses, renews licenses and convert the licenses through various tests.The Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation Division investigates aircraft accidents and incidents. However, as of September 2017, the Government of Nepal is trying to establish an independent aircraft accident investigation unit in order to comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization's regulations. The committee, which is formed after individual accidents is only temporary and often criticized for a lack of results.There was a minor scandal in September and October 2017, when the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation transferred the director general of the agency, Sanjiv Gautam, to the ministry itself, which was considered an attempt of sacking him. The Election Commission revoked this move, as it saw a "a breach of the election code of conduct."The agency's annual report lists the following main tasks:
Issuance of Airworthiness Certificate and License, Rating and Certificate to aviation personnel
Safety Oversight of Aviation Service Provider Organizations
Issuance of Technical Regulations like Civil Aviation Requirements, Directives, Manuals, Advisory Circulars etc.

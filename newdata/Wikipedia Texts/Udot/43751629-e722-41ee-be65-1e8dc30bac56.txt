== Structure ==
UDOT maintains over 6,000 miles (9,700 km) of highways. The department strategic goals include preserve infrastructure, optimize mobility, zero fatalities and strengthen the economy. While the agency has maintenance stations throughout the state, for organizational purposes they are grouped into four regions.


== History ==
Originally, the State Road Commission of Utah, created on 23 March 1909, was responsible for maintenance, but these duties were rolled into the new Department of Transportation in 1975.In 2018, due to concerns over corruption within UDOT, the Utah State Legislature passed a bill which would overhaul the structure the department and rename it the Transit District of Utah. After more public concerns arose regarding the cost of such a change, the move was dropped the next year.

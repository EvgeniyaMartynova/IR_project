Bacton, Herefordshire

Bacton is a small village in the rural area of south-west Herefordshire, England, 14 miles (23 km) from Hereford.


== Parish church ==
The parish church of St Faith's dates from 13th century and has a relatively long entry in Pevsner's survey of the county's buildings.
Inside the church is Blanche Parry's memorial. It is possible that an altar cloth belonging to the parish church was made from a dress once worn by Queen Elizabeth I of England and given to Blanche Parry. The material of the cloth appears to form part of the clothing of the Queen in the early 17th-century "Rainbow Portrait", attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.The church is now part of the Ewyas Harold group of parishes. There is a service about once a month. Next to the church there is a village hall.


== Listed buildings ==
Bacton has a relatively large number of listed buildings. The parish church is listed Grade II* and another 16 buildings, barns and monuments dating from the 17th to 20th centuries are listed as Grade II.


== Transport ==
Bacton has only a single weekly, daytime bus service to Hereford on Wednesdays. The nearest railway station is at Hereford (14 miles, 23 km).


== History ==

One mile to the north of the village are some earthwork remains of a small motte and bailey castle known as Newcourt Tump. ("Tump" is a dialect word for a rounded hill or tumulus.) The castle seems to have fallen out of use by the 14th century.According to Domesday Book in 1086, Bacton, then in the hundred of Stradel, had a mere two households. The Lord of the Manor was Gilbert of Eskecot, whose tenant-in-chief was Roger of Lacy. The later history of the manor is relatively clear from the 13th century onwards.

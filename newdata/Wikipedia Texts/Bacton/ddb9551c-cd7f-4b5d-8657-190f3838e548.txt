Bacton Gas Terminal

The Bacton Gas Terminal is a complex of six gas terminals within four sites located on the North Sea coast of North Norfolk in the United Kingdom. The sites are near Paston and between Bacton and Mundesley; the nearest town is North Walsham.
The other main UK gas terminals which receive gas from the UK continental shelf are at St Fergus, Aberdeenshire; Easington, East Riding of Yorkshire; Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire; CATS Terminal, Teesside; and Rampside gas terminal, Barrow, Cumbria.


== History ==
The Bacton complex which covers an area of about 180 acres (73 ha) opened during 1968. It has a frontage of 1 km (3200 feet) along the cliff top. It was initially built by Shell-Esso, Phillips Petroleum-Arpet Group, Amoco-Gas Council. Planning permission had been given on 16 June 1967 by Anthony Greenwood, Baron Greenwood of Rossendale. The Leman field began production on 13 August 1968 (joint Shell-Esso and joint Amoco-Gas Council), the Hewett field (Phillips Petroleum-Arpet Group) began operations in July 1969 and the Indefatigable field (joint Shell-Esso and joint Amoco-Gas Council) began production in October 1971. Construction of the £5 million Phillips-Arpet plant began in April 1968. Gas from the Shell-Esso part of the Leman field was delivered to Bacton via a 34-mile-long pipeline. A 36-inch diameter 140-mile-long pipeline (Number 2 feeder main) costing £17 million was built by Italsider from Bacton to the National Transmission System near Rugby. When initially completed in 1968 the terminal had a total gas throughput capacity of 3,955 MMSCFD (112 million m3 a day). The Gas Council marketed the new North Sea gas as High Speed Gas.


== Operation ==
The Bacton complex consists of six gas terminals. The terminals are:

Shell
Eni
Perenco
National Grid - feeding the National Transmission System (NTS)
Interconnector UK (within the National Grid site)
BBL (Bacton-Balgzand line) (within the Shell site)Three of the terminals (Eni, Perenco and Shell) receive gas from Southern North Sea (SNS) and some Central North Sea (CNS) offshore gas fields. Initial gas processing, such as removal of free water, takes place on the offshore gas installations. At the terminals gas and condensate are received in slugcatchers (to separate gas and hydrocarbon liquids and condensed water), the gas is compressed if necessary, dehydrated using triethylene glycol, and chilled to achieve a specified hydrocarbon dewpoint. Sour gas (sulphurous) had previously been removed at the Eni site by amine gas treating, now decommissioned. Hydrocarbon condensate is stabilized and piped by the British Pipeline Agency along the route of the former North Walsham to Mundesley railway line to the North Walsham rail terminal and thence by rail to an oil refinery at Harwich Essex. Treated gas from the three terminals flows to the National Grid terminal located immediately to the south of the reception terminals. Two of the terminals (Interconnector and BBL) receive gas from, or deliver gas to, the gas networks of continental Europe. Manifolds within the National Grid terminal blend the gas and distribute it to the National Transmission System at around 1000 psig (69 bar).
The offshore reception terminals were originally run by Royal Dutch Shell-Esso, Phillips Petroleum-Arpet Group and Amoco-Gas Council. Amoco and BP announced they had merged in 1998 to form BP Amoco, the merged organisation changed its name to BP in 2001. Perenco took over the BP operations in September 2003. Tullow had begun operations in 2003 taking over the Phillips Petroleum terminal operations, ENI took over the Tullow Oil operations in December 2008.


=== Shell terminal ===
The Shell terminal, the most easterly of the three, receives gas and condensate from three offshore pipelines. These are a 55.7 km long 30-inch pipeline from the Leman 49/26AP offshore installation; a 106 km long 30-inch pipeline from the Sean PP installation; and a 73 km 24-inch pipeline from the Clipper PT installation. A mothballed 30-inch pipeline formally delivered gas from the Leman 49/26BT installation to Bacton. The terminal also receives gas from the 474 kilometres (295 mi) long 34-inch SEAL Pipeline, which transports gas from the Shearwater and Elgin-Franklin gas fields in the Central North Sea. The SEAL Pipeline is the longest on the UK Continental Shelf. The Shell plant has a gas treatment capacity of 900 MMSCFD (million standard cubic feet per day) and a condensate stabilization capacity of 8,000 barrels per day (1,270 m3/day). The gas hydrocarbon dewpoint is achieved by propane refrigeration. Truck loading facilities for condensate were originally provided. It employs 46 people and began operations in 1968. The BBL Pipeline terminal became operational in December 2006 and is located within the Shell terminal. The BBL terminal is operated, but not owned, by Shell.


=== Eni terminal ===
The most westerly of the terminals is owned by Eni of Italy. It receives gas from two 30-inch pipelines from the Hewett field (27.7 km and 32.8 km long) and a 62 km long 20-inch pipeline from Lancelot 48/17A offshore installation (LAPS complex). A decommissioned 24-inch pipeline formerly delivered gas from the Thames 49/28A offshore installation. Gas and liquid from each pipeline are received and processed separately. After gas and condensate are separated in vessel-type slugcatchers and filter-separators each gas stream is fiscally metered (for tax purposes). The two Hewett field gas streams are combined and increased in pressure through an eductor. The gas stream was formerly treated with amine to remove sulphur compounds, this facility was decommissioned in 2000 when production from the sour Hewett Upper Bunter reservoir was shut-in. The gas is comingled with the LAPS gas then compressed. It was formerly dehydrated using triethylene glycol and underwent hydrocarbon dew point reduction by chilling with propane. Finally it was fiscally metered (for sales) and transferred to the Bacton NTS plant. Formerly the terminal had pentane storage tanks and a truck loading facility. The terminal has two GE 11MW Frame 3 and one GE 3.7MW Frame 1 gas turbines, connected to three centrifugal compressors. In 2011 the Eni Terminal was split by segregating the reception and some of the compression facilities from the dehydration and dewpoint control plant, the latter was decommissioned. Now after compression the gas is sent to the Perenco site for dehydration and dewpoint control. The separated condensate is also sent to the Perenco site. During late 2013/2014 the redundant processing facilities were removed and now the majority of the Eni site is unused.


=== Perenco terminal ===
This terminal, located between the Shell terminal and the Eni terminal, processes gas from pipelines from the Leman, Indefatigable and Trent & Tyne fields. These include two 30-inch pipelines from the Leman 49/27AP and Leman 49/27B offshore installations (61.82 km and 64.9 km respectvely) and a 24-inch pipeline from the Trent 43/24 offshore installation. The processing plant comprises two parallel trains (A1 plant and A2 plant) each with an initial processing capacity of 1,000 MMSCFD (2.8 million m3/day) and a condensate stabilization capacity of 600 m3/day, stabilized condensate is stored in gasoline storage tanks prior being piped to the North Walsham rail terminal. Gas from the 'Leman' pipe-type slugcatcher is normally routed to dewpoint control plant streams 1, 2 and 3; gas from the 'Inde' pipe-type slugcatcher is routed to dewpoint control plant streams 4 & 5. Gas from the Tyne and Trent pipe-type slugcather can be routed to either dew point control plant. There is also a cross-connection to and from the Shell terminal.
The ENI terminal was integrated into the Perenco Terminal in 2011, thereby diverting the Hewett, LAPS and at one time Thames gas and condensate from the slug catchers and compression in the Eni terminal to the Perenco terminal upstream of the dehydration and dew point control plant.


=== National Grid terminal ===
Connections from the offshore reception terminals comprise two 30-inch lines from the Eni terminal (now disused), two 30-inch lines from the Perenco terminal, four 24-inch lines from the Shell terminal and a 36-inch line from the BBL pipeline. Gas from the Perenco and Shell terminals is filtered, measured through orifice plates and the flow regulated by volume into a manifold system. Facilities for heating the gas by pressurised hot water are provided should this be necessary if the pressure of the incoming gas has to be reduced appreciably. There are four 36-inch manifolds within the National Grid terminal, plus one spare, which can receive flow from any of the incoming lines, thus blending the gas. A 24-inch by-pass ringmain around the site perimeter enables the terminal to be completely by-passed in an emergency. The blended gases are odourised (1 kg odorant for 60,000 m3 of gas) and the flow rate is measured and distributed then to the National Transmission System via five outgoing feeders:

Feeder No 2 to Brisley, Peterborough and Rugby, 36-inch
Feeder No 3 to Roudham Heath, Cambridge and Hitchin, 36-inch
Feeder No 4 to Great Ryburgh, King's Lynn and Alrewas, 36-inch
Feeder No 5 to Yelverton, Diss, Chelmsford and Horndon-on-the-Hill, 36-inch
Feeder No 27 to King's Lynn, 36-inchFrom the National Grid terminal gas can also be sent to, or received from, Zeebrugge, Belgium via the Interconnector, received from the Netherlands via the 36-inch Balgzand Bacton Line BBL Pipeline. Gas is also sent via the 12-inch BPA pipeline to Great Yarmouth power station, and distributed to the local area via a low pressure gas distribution system.


=== Interconnector UK terminal ===

The Interconnector terminal is located within the National Grid terminal. It can import gas from, or export gas to, Zeebrugge, Belgium via a 235 km pipeline operating at up to 147 bar. There is a 30-inch direct access line from the SEAL pipeline. It works via four GE LM2500 gas turbines and a Thermodyn centrifugal compressor in its compressor station, which was built by Kværner John Brown (now called Aker Solutions). The Interconnector was commissioned in 1998.


=== BBL terminal ===
The BBL (Bacton–Balgzand line) terminal is located within the Shell terminal, it receives gas from the compressor station in Anna Paulowna in the Netherlands. The Bacton reception plant is owned by BBL Company and the plant is operated by Shell. Gas arrives at Bacton at approximately seabed temperature and a pressure of up to 135 bar but which varies depending on the amount of line pack. Bacton’s role is to reduce the pressure for entry to the National Transmission System. As such, significant Joule–Thomson cooling may occur prior to gas injection into the NTS. Therefore, four identical parallel streams are installed at Bacton, each equipped with a direct-fired water bath heater on a slipstream and designed to operate as three duty and one standby at maximum flow conditions, in order to control the delivery temperature and pressure of the gas. The BBL Pipeline is 235 km long and was commissioned in December 2006.


== Shell gas fields ==


=== Leman ===
The Leman field is 30 miles (48 km) north-east of Great Yarmouth. It is 800 ft (240 m) thick Rotliegendes sandstone reservoir at a depth of about 6,000 ft (1830 m). It is about 18 miles (29 km) long by 5 miles (8 km) wide. It was discovered in August 1966 is licensed to Shell (Block 49/26) and Perenco (Block 49/27). The Leman 49/26A (AD1, AD2, AP & AK) installation began production in August 1968. It had initial recoverable reserves of 292 billion m3. It is connected to the Shell terminal at Bacton.

== Baird and Deborah gas storage ==
The Rough facility is currently the only depleted UK offshore gas field reservoir that is used for gas storage and retrieval. Several projects have been developed to use other depleted gas fields but none have proved to be economically viable. Two examples associated with Bacton are the Baird and the Deborah Gas Storage Projects.


=== Baird gas storage project ===
Perenco’s Baird field is located in Block 49/23, 86 km off the coast of Norfolk. It is located adjacent to Perenco’s Indefatigable field through which it exports gas via Inde 49/23D.
The Baird gas storage project was to have been built by Centrica Storage and Perenco (UK) Ltd. Centrica acquired 70% interest in the project from Perenco in February 2009. The companies formed a 70/30% joint venture called Bacton Storage Company to operate the facility when completed.The project involved the transport of gas from the National Transmission System (NTS) through the Perenco onshore terminal at Bacton and then by pipeline offshore to be injected and stored in the Baird reservoir. Gas injection would take place during the Summer and be reversed during the Winter drawing gas from the reservoir for processing at Bacton and delivery into the NTS.
The onshore facilities included three gas turbine driven compressors, a gas dehydration plant, reception heaters, a mono ethylene glycol (MEG) storage and regeneration plant, additional gas fiscal metering systems and a vent stack. These facilities would be built on Perenco’s terminal at Bacton. Planning permission was given by North Norfolk District Council on 27 July 2010.
The offshore facilities were a single four-legged normally unattended installation (NUI). The installation would have 18 well slots with up to 14 development wells. The NUI would be connected to Bacton through a 100 km long 38-inch diameter bidirectional pipeline. A 4.5-inch MEG line was to run in parallel delivering MEG from Bacton to the NUI.
The field would have a storage capacity of 81 billion cubic feet (2.3 billion cubic metres) making it the second largest gas storage facility in the UK. The facility would have a 50-year design life.
The project was expected to be completed in 2013 but was put on hold in 2012 with no construction work taking place. On 23 September 2013 Centrica announced that they would not proceed with the Baird project in light of weak economics for gas storage projects and the announcement by the Government on 4 September 2013 ruling out intervention in the market to encourage additional gas storage capacity in the UK.


=== Deborah gas storage project ===
Eni’s Deborah field lies in Blocks 48/28, 48/29, 48/30 and 52/03 about 40 km from the Norfolk coast. It is adjacent to the Hewett field through which it has produced gas since 1970.
The project was developed by Eni Hewett Limited. As with the Baird project gas would have been injected into the offshore reservoir during Summer months and withdrawn during the Winter and treated onshore at Bacton for delivery into the NTS.The onshore facilities would include new reception facilities for the pipelines, two compressor houses for four new compressor, water treatment works, glycol storage and two vent stacks. Planning permission for the onshore facilities was given by North Norfolk District Council on 24 November 2010.
The offshore facilities would be two NUI platforms about 2 km apart located above the Deborah reservoir. There would be a total of 33 injection/withdrawal wells plus two monitoring wells spread between the two platforms. Each platform would be connected to Bacton by one of two 41-km-long 32-inch diameter bidirectional pipelines. A 2 km long 32-inch pipeline would connect the two platforms. A 41 km glycol pipeline would be piggybacked to one of the gas lines. A 41-km power and fibre optic control monitoring and communication cable from Bacton to one of the platforms and 2-km cables between the platforms would be provided.
The Deborah field was to have a storage capacity of 4.6 billion cubic metres. The facility was to have a 40-year design life. A gas storage licence was granted by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) on 22 October 2010. Start up was planned for April 2015. The project was mothballed in Autumn 2013.


== Installation identification ==
An offshore installation on the UK Continental Shelf may comprise a single integrated platform or two or more bridge-linked platforms. Installations are identified by a large black-on-yellow sign on the installation. This may give the name of the original or current owner or operator, the field name, and a set of numbers and letters, e.g. Shell/Esso Leman 49/26A. The numbers identify the Quadrant and Block where the installation is located, e.g. 49/26 is in Quadrant 49 Block 26.[6] The first letter is a sequential letter (A, B, C, D, etc.) identifying each installation within a field. The second and subsequent letters may designate a platform's function, e.g. the Leman 49/26A complex comprises four bridge-linked platforms 49/26AP (Production), 49/26AD1 (Drilling 1), 49/26AD2 (Drilling 2), and 49/26AK (Compression). Common designations are:

Note: Drilling refers to the original function of the platform to support well drilling operations. No Southern North Sea installation has permanent drilling facilities.
On some installations the letters simply provide a unique two letter identity, e.g.Tethys TN, Viscount VO.


== Accidents and incidents ==
On 13 August 1981, 11 gas workers lost their lives in the G-ASWI North Sea ditching, in a Wessex helicopter. At 6pm on 28 February 2008, there was an explosion and fire at the Shell UK terminal, for which Shell was fined £1 million.


== Coastal erosion ==
When the terminal was first built in the 1960s, it was 100 metres (330 ft) from the sea. By 2019 coastal erosion had reduced this to 10 metres (33 ft). In July 2019 a scheme commenced to deposit almost two million cubic metres of sand, forming a 6-kilometre (3.7 mi) artificial dune. Costing £20 million, the scheme will protect the villages of Bacton and Walcott as well as the gas terminal. The sea defences, designed by Dutch engineering company Royal HaskoningDHV, are expected to protect the site for between 15 and 20 years. The dune will be 7 metres (23 ft) high and extend up to 250 metres (820 ft) out to sea. The scheme, which uses sand instead of concrete, was inspired by an experiment in the Netherlands called the Zandmotor. £14.5 million of the cost of the scheme will be covered by the Bacton gas terminal operators, with £5 million being contributed by the Environment Agency and £0.5 million from North Norfolk District Council.

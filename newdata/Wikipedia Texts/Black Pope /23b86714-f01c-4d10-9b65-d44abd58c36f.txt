Papa Nero (song)

"Papa Nero" ("Black Pope") is a song by the Venetian reggae band Pitura Freska, with lyrics in the  Venetian language.
It was performed at the 1997 Sanremo Music Festival, and became very popular throughout Italy.  It is notable for being one of the very few songs (if not the only song) in Venetian that got significant media exposure outside the Veneto region.

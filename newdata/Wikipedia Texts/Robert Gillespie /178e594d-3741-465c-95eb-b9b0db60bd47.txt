Robert G. Gillespie

Robert G. Gillespie (1903 – January 31, 1983) was an FBI agent who participated in the capture of bank robber John Dillinger, and who later became a justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court.
Born in Madison, Alabama, Gillespie was raised in Mississippi. He briefly attended the University of Alabama Law School, but was unable to afford the program, instead dropping out and reading law to be admitted to practice in Mississippi, in 1927. He spent less than a year in the FBI, from 1934–1935, but during that time he participated in the ambush leading to the death of infamous bank robber John Dillinger. He left the FBI after contracting tuberculosis, from which he recuperated in Mississippi.
Gillespie practised law in Meridian, Mississippi with Thomas L. Bailey, and was appointed to the Mississippi Supreme Court in 1954, by Governor Hugh L. White. He became Chief Justice in 1971, holding that office until his retirement from the court on August 1, 1977. After his retirement from the court, he taught at the Mississippi College School of Law until 1981.

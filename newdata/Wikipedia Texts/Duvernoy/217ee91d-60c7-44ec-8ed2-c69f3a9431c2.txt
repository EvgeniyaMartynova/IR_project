Victor Alphonse Duvernoy

Victor-Alphonse Duvernoy (pronounced [vik.tɔʁ al.fɔ̃s dy.vɛʁ.nwa]) (30 August 1842 in Paris – 7 March 1907 in Paris) was a French pianist and composer. Duvernoy counts composer Alexander Winkler (1865–1935) and Norah Drewett de Kresz (1882–1960) among his students. His brother was singer and pianist Edmond Duvernoy.


== Life and career ==
Duvernoy, son of noted bass-baritone Charles-François Duvernoy (1796–1872), was a student of Antoine François Marmontel, François Bazin and Auguste Barbereau at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied piano from 1886. He subsequently made his career as a piano virtuoso, a composer and professor of piano at the Conservatoire de Paris.
He composed operas, a ballet, symphonic and chamber music works, as well as music for piano.  His 1880 symphonic poem La tempête for soloists, chorus and orchestra after William Shakespeare's The Tempest won the Grand Prix de la Ville de Paris in 1900.

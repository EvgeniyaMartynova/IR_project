Electronic badge

An electronic badge is a gadget that is mainly handed out at computer (security) conferences and hacker events. Their main feature is to display the name of the attendee, but due to their electronic nature they can include a variety of software. The badges were originally a tradition at DEF CON, but spread across different events.

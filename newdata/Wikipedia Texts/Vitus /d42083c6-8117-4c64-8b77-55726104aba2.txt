== History ==
Saint Vitus was opened in April 2011 by Arty Shepherd, Justin Scurti, and George Souleidis, along with silent owners. The space was formerly a plumbing school and before that was a social club, and the owners hired Matthew Maddy (No. 7, Weather Up in Prospect Heights and Tribeca, The Box) to design the space, with the intention of only hosting occasional live shows. In April 2016, Saint Vitus celebrated its 5-year anniversary with five nights of shows featuring headlining sets from Pallbearer, Corrosion of Conformity, Royal Thunder, and 13th Chime. It has also played host to several regional qualifiers for US Air Guitar.
Saint Vitus hosts weekly metal yoga sessions run by Metal Yoga Bones.  In addition, visual artist Karlynn Holland periodically curates day-long art shows under the moniker Dreams Were Made For Mortals.In 2013, Shepherd and David Castillo, Saint Vitus's talent buyer, started up a record label called Sacrament Recordings and Merchandise to release an album by the band Sannhet.

== Plot ==
Jeff Mathews, an American businessman, is involved in a car crash in Bangkok, Thailand.  When he wakes up in a hospital, his nurse, Choi Luang, informs him that his wife Som and son Kyle have died.  Inexplicably, Mathews can feel no grief for his loss.  Disturbed by his lack of emotion and apparent hallucinations that plague him, he seeks help from Luang.  She brings him to her psychic aunt, who informs him that she believes his soul has been separated from his body.  Although she can not help him, she refers him to Warren Mills, an American spiritualist who has experience with reconnecting souls.  Mills, who believes the necessary ceremony is too dangerous, is initially reluctant to get involved but eventually agrees to help.  Mills explains that Mathews must cross a dangerous passage guarded by demons and maintain his concentration during a critical ceremony in which he will be tempted.  However, Mathews abandons the ceremony when he discovers that his family is threatened by the demons.  Mills takes over for him, and Mathews crosses over to the afterlife in order to save his family.  Mathews successfully leads his family out of danger and reunites with his lost soul.

== Summary ==

Montana Max has opened a new theatre in Acme Acres, but the only movies he shows are ones where he's the hero, and Buster Bunny is the villain. It's up to Buster Bunny to go into the films and change the plots. Buster is assisted by the crazy Gogo Dodo, and will encounter him in each movie, where he can get assistance from each of his friends.
At the end of each stage, Montana Max appears in a themed costume for each film, and challenges Buster to battle. Of course, other famous foes of Buster's will be there to try to stop him, including Roderick Rat.
There are five stages, with the first four being different films that Montana's showing, and the final stage is being held in the backlots of Montana's movie studio. Buster simply has to go through the stages before the time runs out. Collecting carrots along the way earns Buster extra lives and bonus points. By the end of a stage, Buster confronts Max as a boss. Defeating him, requires Buster to stomp on him five times. In between stages, Buster can participate in a bonus sports game against one of his friends or rivals.

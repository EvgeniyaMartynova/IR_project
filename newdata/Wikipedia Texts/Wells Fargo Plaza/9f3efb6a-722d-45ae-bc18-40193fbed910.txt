Wells Fargo Plaza (Phoenix)

The Wells Fargo Plaza is a high-rise skyscraper located on 100 West Washington Street in Downtown Phoenix, Arizona, United States. It opened as the First National Bank Plaza on October 25, 1971, and was later known as the First Interstate Bank Building. It is 372 feet (113 m) tall. It is designed in the Brutalist style, an architectural style spawned from the International Style. The “raw concrete” element of Brutalist architecture allows for no exterior finish which exposes the rough concrete columns and beams.
The tower was designed by the Phoenix office of Charles Luckman and Associates and constructed by the Henry C. Beck Company.The tower sits on a base three stories high, then rises to its full height. The repetitive angular windows add another Brutalist element of blocky appearance and expression of structure.
The Wells Fargo History Museum is on the first floor. Exhibits include an extensive collection of western-themed art depicting Wells Fargo's role in the mines of Arizona, a 19th-century stagecoach, telegraph equipment and minerals.

== History ==

It was designed by Richard Keating, FAIA, while a partner of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. In 1983, the building lost a large number of windows during Hurricane Alicia. Originally named the Allied Bank Plaza, it was renamed to the First Interstate Bank Plaza in 1988. First Interstate Bancorp was then taken over in 1996 by Wells Fargo, therefore transferring ownership of he building.
In 1993, the Consulate-General of the United Kingdom in Houston leased 9,707 square feet (901.8 m2) in the First Interstate Plaza. In 1995 Koll Real Estate lost the management contract for the First Interstate Plaza. In 1996, NGC Corp. (now Dynegy) leased 260,000 square feet (24,000 m2) in the First Interstate Plaza. The company moved over 700 jobs from a suburban office building along U.S. Route 290 (Northwest Freeway) to the Wells Fargo Plaza. In 2012, the company moved out of the building as part of downsizing initiatives while undergoing bankruptcy procedures.In 2006, Targa Resources signed an 11-year lease to occupy 101,600 square feet (9,440 m2) of space in the Wells Fargo Plaza. Targa expanded from its subleased space and began to occupy floors 43 through 46. With the expiration of the lease, Targa has since moved to 811 Louisiana. In 2007, CB Richard Ellis became the exclusive leasing agent for Wells Fargo Plaza. As of October of that year the building was 91% leased. The leased space consists mostly of large tenants, with some mid-sized tenants occupying space.In December 2014, PwC moved into the offices formerly occupied by Dynegy.

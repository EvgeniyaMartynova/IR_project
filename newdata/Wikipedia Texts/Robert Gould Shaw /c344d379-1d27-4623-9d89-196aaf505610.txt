Robert Gould Shaw II

Robert Gould Shaw II (sometimes referred to as RGS II) (June 16, 1872 — March 29, 1930) was a wealthy landowner, international polo player of the Myopia Hunt Club [Biographical History of Massachusetts, Eliot, Vol. IX] and socialite of the leisure class in the greater Boston area of Massachusetts. He was one of the prominent figures of the boom years at the turn of the century, sometimes called the Gilded Age.
Born in 1872 into one of the wealthiest and most influential families in Boston, he was a first cousin of Robert Gould Shaw (called RGS). As an adult, RGS II gained a reputation for alcohol abuse and promiscuity. His first wife was Nancy Witcher Langhorne, and they had a son, Robert Gould Shaw III (called RGS III or "Bobby"). RGS II and Langhorne divorced after four years of marriage. She moved to England after some time, where she met and married Waldorf Astor, who later succeeded his father as Viscount.
RGS II married again and had another son, Louis Agassiz Shaw II. Both of his sons suffered from depression, alcoholism, and legal difficulties. Bobby was arrested in England for homosexuality; he eventually committed suicide in 1970. Louis Agassiz Shaw II murdered his 60-year-old maid in 1964, for which he never stood trial. He was determined to be unfit for trial and was remanded instead to a psychiatric hospital, where he resided for nearly the rest of his life.


== Family and early life ==

RGS II was the youngest child of Quincy Adams Shaw and Pauline Agassiz. Quincy was one of the wealthiest men in Massachusetts as a result of his investment in the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company. RGS II's four older siblings were Louis, Pauline, Marian, and Quincy Jr. His father's side of the family had Anglo-American roots extending back to passengers on the Mayflower. His paternal grandparents were Robert Gould Shaw (1776—1853) and Elizabeth Willard Parkman (1785—1853). His maternal grandfather was Louis Agassiz (1807—1873), a prominent paleontologist, glaciologist, geologist, and scholar of the Earth's natural history who immigrated from Switzerland in 1846.
A granduncle was George Parkman (1790—1849), a murder victim in a highly publicized case that shook the city of Boston to its core in 1849—1850, due to the gruesome nature of the crime and the high social station of both the victim and the murderer.
His first cousin (once removed) was Francis Parkman, Jr. (1823—1893), a noted American historian and author of The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life.
A paternal uncle was Francis George Shaw (October 23, 1809—November 7, 1882), an outspoken advocate of the abolition of slavery.
A maternal uncle was Alexander Emanuel Agassiz (1835—1910), who served as president of Calumet and Hecla Mining Company from 1871–1910, as well as president of the National Academy of Sciences (1901—1907).
His cousin Rodolphe Louis Agassiz (1871—1933) was a ten goal polo champion who later became chairman of the board of the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company.
His cousin Josephine Shaw (1843—1905) was married to Brigadier General Charles Russell Lowell III, who was killed at the Battle of Cedar Creek.
His nephew Louis Agassiz Shaw, Jr. (1886—1940) was a professor of physiology at Harvard Medical School and co-inventor of the first widely used iron lung.


== First marriage ==

On October 27, 1897, RGS II married Nancy Witcher Langhorne (1879—1964) in New York City. She was the 18-year-old daughter of railroad millionaire Chiswell Dabney Langhorne and Nancy Witcher Keene. They had one son, Robert Gould Shaw III (August 18, 1898 — July 10, 1970).The marriage was unhappy for both RGS II and Nancy. RGS II's friends accused Nancy of being puritanical and rigid, while Nancy's friends contended that RGS II was an alcoholic and a womanizer. Nancy left RGS II numerous times during their brief marriage, the first time during their honeymoon. In 1903, Nancy's mother died and she divorced RGS II, returning to Mirador, her childhood home.In 1905, while a passenger on a trans-Atlantic ship to England, the recently divorced Nancy met Waldorf Astor, eldest son of William Waldorf Astor and Mary Dahlgren Paul of the Astor family. The couple were married in May 1906, settling in Cliveden, a present from his father and the Astor family estate in Taplow, Buckinghamshire, England. In 1919, Nancy ran for Parliament and won, becoming the first woman to sit as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons.After his ex-wife and son moved to England, RGS II had a limited role in his son Bobby's life.


== Second marriage ==
RGS II married Mary Hannington and they had four sons, Gould Shaw, George Alexander Shaw, Louis Agassiz Shaw II (c. 1906—c. 1987) and Paul Agassiz Shaw (1912-1983)[Biographical History of Massachusetts, Eliot, Vol. IX]. RGS II purchased a tract of land in Oak Hill, Newton, shortly after the death of its owner, William Sumner Appleton (1840—1903), father of William Sumner Appleton, Jr.). He commissioned Boston architect James Lovell Little, Jr. to design and construct several buildings on the property, including outbuildings of a carriage house and horse stable in 1910, a cow barn in 1912, and a primary residence (the Appleton/Shaw House) in 1912. The family lived briefly in a brownstone building located at 35 Commonwealth Avenue in the Back Bay in 1915, presumably awaiting the completion of their new home in Newton.


== Death and legacy ==

As the Gilded Age gave way to the Progressive Era and eventually the Great Depression, the Shaw fortune collapsed. RGS II died in 1930. The vacant and decaying Shaw estate in Newton was sold in 1939 to Dr. William Fitts Carlson. Carlson used the property as the new campus for Mount Ida Junior College. Adjoining tracts of land were converted into the Wells Avenue office park in the 1970s, and the Charles River Footpath (since renamed the Helen Heyn Riverway) in the 1990s.


== In popular culture ==
Artist R.G. Harper Pennington (1854—1920) in one of his paintings depicted a nude RGS II as the character "Little Billee" from the bohemian novel Trilby (1894) by George du Maurier. This painting hung in the bedroom of Henry Symes Lehr, the homosexual husband of Elizabeth Wharton Drexel.In a 1982 episode of Masterpiece Theatre that chronicled the life of Nancy Astor, Pierce Brosnan portrayed RGS II as a profligate and promiscuous gambler. In this version, Nancy Langhorne Astor continued to love RGS II after her marriage to Waldorf Astor, but this has not been documented. For this performance, Brosnan was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor in 1985.

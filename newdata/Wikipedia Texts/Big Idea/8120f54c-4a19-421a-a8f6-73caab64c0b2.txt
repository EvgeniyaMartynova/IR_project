"You will never win fame and fortune unless you invent big ideas. It takes a big idea to attract the attention of consumers and get them to buy your product. Unless your advertising contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night." - David Ogilvy
The Big Idea can do many things:
Change pop-culture
Transform a language
Start a businessThe management of Big Ideas is more important now than ever before, because the market is flooded with idea creators, media coverage is constantly increasing and the number of professionals able to deal with idea assessment is scarce.


== Creation ==
The creation of a Big Idea can be described through two main approaches:


=== Spontaneous ===
Not forcing yourself into anything, allowing the Idea to form naturally from the marketing challenge you are facing.
As advised by George Lois:

Start out blank, with an open mind, make no assumptions
Forget the trends and traditions surrounding you
Do not concentrate on creating the Big Idea, "you snare it from the air as it floats around you"


=== Research ===
Collect valuable information from consumers by the using qualitative and quantitative research. Steps:

Create list of ideas
Collect data from consumers
Assess the list, considering the information gathered

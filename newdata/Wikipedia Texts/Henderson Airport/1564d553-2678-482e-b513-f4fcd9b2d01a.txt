SkyVector aeronautical chart for 0N6Over a period of 15 years David Henderson restored over 135 Piper J3 Cubs at this facility and built 4 experimental aircraft. They hosted a training program for Thai military members and trained over 125 service members rotating about 10 at a time. Restored the first aircraft to fly in Thailand building most of the airplane from scratch. The airports demise was a house placed at the end of the runway against all FAA rules that the State and FAA refused to enforce. Dave Henderson ultimately rewrote the Delaware Aviation code section on Structures around airports, and it was adopted by the State of Delaware. To this day Henderson has never been recognized for his contributions to Aviation in Delaware.

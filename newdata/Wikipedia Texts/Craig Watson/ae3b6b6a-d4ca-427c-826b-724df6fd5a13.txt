== Career ==
Craig Watson married to Anne Watson with 2 children, Lynn and Grant. 
Watson was a member of the youngest Rangers forward line in the history of the club when he lined up alongside Willie Henderson, Alex Willoughby, Jim Forrest, and George McLean against Real Madrid in a European Cup match in the Bernabeu Stadium in 1963. Regrettably, Rangers were thrashed 6-0 by the team generally regarded as the finest in Europe at the time, although the Spaniards were eventually beaten 3-1 by Italian giants Inter Milan in the final that same season.
Watson's proudest achievement was playing in the 1963-64 League Cup final, when Rangers trounced Morton 5-0. He later transferred to Cappielow, spending several seasons playing under the legendary Hal Stewart.
Watson, who also had spells with Kilmarnock and Falkirk, eventually emigrated to South Africa, where he ended his playing career.

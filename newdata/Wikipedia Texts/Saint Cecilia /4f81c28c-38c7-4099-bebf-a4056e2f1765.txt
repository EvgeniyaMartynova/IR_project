Saint Cecilia (Poussin)

Saint Cecilia is a 1627-1628 painting by Nicolas Poussin, now in the Prado Museum in Madrid. It shows saint Cecilia playing a keyboard instrument, possibly a harpsichord. Two cherubs in front of her hold up a scroll with a musical score, whilst two angels sing in the background and a third cherub lifts a curtain.

== History ==
Santa Cecilia Tower was built in 1613 by Fra Bernardo Macedonia, Commander of Artillery of the Order of St. John. It got its name from the nearby Santa Cecilia Chapel, which is the oldest surviving chapel on Gozo. The chapel eventually became an ancillary building to the tower.

The tower was able to communicate with the batteries at Ramla Bay as well as Mġarr ix-Xini Tower, so it could relay messages across Gozo. It was also able to provide refuge for the local population in case of a corsair raid.Today, the tower is a private residence. It was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The tower is now scheduled as a Grade 1 monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

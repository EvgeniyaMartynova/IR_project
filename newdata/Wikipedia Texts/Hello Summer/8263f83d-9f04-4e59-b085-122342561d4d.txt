Hello Summer (song)

"Hello Summer" is a song recorded by American country music singer Danielle Bradbery for her second studio album, I Don't Believe We've Met (2017). The song was written by Thomas Rhett, Rhett Akins, and Jaren Johnston as well as the track's producer, Julian Bunetta. A solo version by Bradbery was released digitally through Big Machine Records as the album's second promotional single on September 22, 2017. In 2018, "Hello Summer" was re-recorded as a duet with one of its co-writers, Thomas Rhett, and released under the title "Goodbye Summer" as the album's third official radio single.


== Background and recording ==
"Hello Summer" was written by American country singer Thomas Rhett with his father, Rhett Akins, Jaren Johnston of The Cadillac Three, and Rhett's frequent co-writer, Julian Bunetta, in a session intended for his third studio album, Life Changes (2017). The song did not make the final track listing and was instead offered to Bradbery, with whom Rhett had previously collaborated on a re-recording of the track "Playing with Fire" from the deluxe edition of his second album, Tangled Up (2015). Parts of the song were re-written by Rhett and Akins to better suit a female perspective. Bradbery told Entertainment Tonight that while it was one of three songs on I Don't Believe We've Met that she didn't co-write, the song "really speaks to the same emotional theme of the record." In 2018, the song came full circle and was re-recorded as a duet between Rhett and Bradbery, with a few lyrical tweaks incorporating the updated title ("Goodbye Summer") and re-introducing the male perspective.


== Content ==
"Hello Summer" is a country pop song with tropical influences. Lyrically, the song explores the ups and downs of a short-lived seasonal relationship that leaves the narrator heartbroken. While the solo version provides a one-sided look at the relationship, the dual perspectives in "Goodbye Summer" provide a shared sense of less between two people emotionally "heading in different directions."


== Music video ==
An "instant grat" video for the song was directed by Chris Hicky and premiered September 22, 2017. The video eschews a plot-driven storyline in favor of focusing on Bradbery as she sings in front of various scenic backdrops including a forest, fog, and an array of colourful flags.

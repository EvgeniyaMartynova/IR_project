== History ==
Viluppuram district was once a part of the South Arcot district along with the Cuddalore district. Later, Cuddalore district was bifurcated and Viluppuram district came into existence on 30 September 1993. As a result, the Viluppuram district's history closely resembles that of Cuddalore's. 
The Cholas were among the earliest rulers. Karikala Chola was the most influential. Simhavishnu Pallava overthrew the Cholas, and the region came under the Pallava rule. Vijayalaya Chola restored the rule of Chola, marking the beginning of the Chola Empire.With the rise of Jatavarman Sundara Pandya I (1251 A.D.), Chola supremacy came to an end. The Pandyan dynasty rule lasted more than 50 years, followed by Muslim domination from 1334 A.D. to 1378 A.D. By 1378 A.D., the region came under the rule of Vijayanagara empire, and Nayaks were appointed rulers of the region.In 1677, Shivaji overtook the Gingee area with the help of Golkonda forces. Then came the reign of the Mughals, which is when the English and French acquired settlements in South Arcot District. The entire district became a war zone during the Anglo-French rivalry and it came under the control of the East India Company. It remained under British authority until the independence of India in 1947.On January 2019, Kallakurichi district was carved out of Villupram.

She is famous for introducing themes of sexual contact in magazine ads, especially "A skin you love to touch" ad. In 1911, the Woodbury Soap Company became the first to use images of sexual contact to sell a product. Her copy promised the soap would increase the beauty of one's skin; it offered a color print and a week's supply of the soap for 10 cents. The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history. It was ranked 31st on Advertising Age's list of the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century.She married Stanley B. Resor in 1917. He was the president of J. Walter Thompson and was also inducted into the Hall of Fame.Resor was also active in the suffrage movement.

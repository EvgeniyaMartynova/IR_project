== KPN acquisition attempt ==
In early August 2013, América Móvil offered to take over the remaining 70% stake of the Dutch telecommunications company KPN for 7.2 billion Euros ($9.49 billion). América Móvil currently owns close to 30% of KPN. The Dutch government has warned against this acquisition quoting it as a threat to national security. The Dutch government's intervention comes after the council representing  employees of KPN urged authorities  to halt América Móvil's planned bid.

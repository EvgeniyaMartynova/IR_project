In 1876 he married Eveline, the daughter of T. Horsman Coles from Ore in East Sussex. They had two sons and two daughters. Both sons, Gilbert and Maurice, were killed during the First World War.

== Politics ==
Soames was a Liberal in the Radical tradition. He was Chairman of the East Marylebone Liberal and Radical Association. He was adopted as the Radical candidate for Ipswich at the 1892 general election and fought the seat, without success, in 1895. However he got his opportunity to enter Parliament at a by-election in the constituency of South Norfolk held on 12 May 1898. The by-election was occasioned by the resignation on grounds of ill-health of the sitting Liberal Unionist (formerly Liberal) MP, Francis Taylor. Standing as a Radical, Soames gained 4,625 votes. His Unionist opponent, Sancroft Holmes received  3,295 giving a very healthy Liberal majority of 1,330.Soames decided not to contest his seat again at the 1918 general election, by that time aged 66 years.

Henry Soames

Henry Soames (18 January 1843â€“ 30 August 1913) was an English cricketer. Soames' batting style is unknown. He was born at Brighton, Sussex, and was educated at Brighton College.  His father, William Aldwin Soames, had founded the college in 1845.
Soames made a single first-class appearance for Hampshire against Kent in 1867 at B. M. Close's Ground, Southborough. Hampshire won the toss and elected to bat first, with the county making 41 all out in their first-innings, with Soames being dismissed for 2 runs by George Bennett. Kent then made 231 all out in their first-innings, to which Hampshire responded to in their second-innings by making 212 all out, with Soames top-scoring in the innings with 52, before he was dismissed by Charles Payne. Kent went on to win the match by nine wickets. This was his only major appearance for the county.
Soames died at Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 30 August 1913. His brother, William, played first-class cricket for Sussex.

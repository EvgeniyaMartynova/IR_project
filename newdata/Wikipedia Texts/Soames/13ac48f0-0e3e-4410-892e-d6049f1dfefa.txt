On 16 Mar 1948 to Audrey Alma Humphreys.His father Harold committed suicide by walking into the sea at Bournemouth, Dorset on Christmas Day 1918; his sister Auriol Edith Davidson, also committed suicide, by throwing herself under a train at Chestnut, Hertfordshire on 5 April 1919.
In 1934, he inherited the mansion and estate of Sheffield Park, Sussex, from his father's brother, Arthur Gilstrap Soames (who had purchased it in 1909), selling the estate in 1953. He also disposed of part of his extensive library around that time.He died in a London hospital on 6 July 1962 aged 75.Note: The contents of Sheffield Park were auctioned by Sotheby’s at the house in 1954.
The documents relating to Sheffield House were purchased on 3 March the same year from Sotheby’s in London, for the sterling equivalent of $36.40 by Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, and it can only be assumed that they were extracted from the earlier auction at Sheffield Park with a view to a private sale. Their export to the United States had been in contravention of the Manorial Documents Rules, and in June 2000, the University generously returned the documents to East Sussex, where they were received by the acting Master of the Rolls and the Lord Lieutenant in her capacity of Custos Rotulorum at a ceremony on 24 July.

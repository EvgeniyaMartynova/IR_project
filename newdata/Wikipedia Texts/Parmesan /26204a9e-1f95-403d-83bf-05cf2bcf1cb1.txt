Parmo

The parmo, or Teesside Parmesan, is a dish originating in Middlesbrough, Teesside, and a popular item of take-away food in North East England. It consists of a breaded cutlet of chicken or pork topped with a white béchamel sauce and cheese, usually cheddar cheese. The name of the dish is a reference to the Italian dish parmigiana, and its variants such as chicken parmigiana, which are made with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. The parmo ranked 20th in Britain's Top 20 Favourite Takeaways. 


== History ==


=== Origins ===
Parmo is said to have been created by Nicos Harris, a chef with the United States army in World War II. He was wounded in France, but was brought to the United Kingdom to be treated in a British hospital. Eventually, he moved to Middlesbrough and opened a restaurant, The American Grill, on Linthorpe Road, where he created parmo in 1958. His son-in-law, Caramello, still lived in Teesside as of 2014, continuing the family tradition.


=== Supermarket sales ===
In 2009, supermarket chain Asda started selling parmo in their shops in Teesside. They claimed they were selling 6,000 chicken parmos a week, making them at the time the shop's fastest-selling line. Asda later expanded this line to branches outside Teesside.


== Variations ==

Common parmo variants include additional toppings and preparations of the meat. These include:
Parmo hotshot - a spicy version topped with cheese, pepperoni, peppers, garlic butter and chilli
Parmo Kiev - topped with cheese, garlic butter and mushrooms
Parmo Italia - topped with cheese, garlic butter and ham, with a further topping of mozzarella cheese
Meat feast parmo - topped with pepperoni, chicken and ham
Parmo Zeno - topped with cheese and onionsDue to its size, a full parmo is usually served in a pizza box with any accompanying chips and salad, although a large round polystyrene tray is also common.
In 2019, Pizza Hut introduced a parmo under the name chicken melt, with variations including pepperoni, garlic mushrooms and BBQ Americano.

== In popular culture ==
Parmo was cooked by Antony Worrall Thompson on ITV's Saturday Cooks! on 15 December 2007, with guidance from Tamsinne Hatfield, who originally brought the recipe to the attention of the chef.
Parmo appeared on Channel 4's Ruth Watson's Hotel Rescue programme on 14 October 2009 from the Kenbarry Hotel/The Blackpool, Blackpool where Ruth described it as "the antichrist of cooking".
The parmo was the subject of a question in the TV quiz show Eggheads on 13 November 2009. In the final round, when asked the region from which parmo originates, the challenging team incorrectly answered East Anglia, in preference to North Wales and the correct answer Teesside. The incorrect answer given meant the Eggheads won that particular day's contest.
On 30 May 2010, a small parmo was served as a starter in an edition of Channel 4's Come Dine with Me filmed in Darlington.
On 27 January 2013, hosts Tim Lovejoy and Simon Rimmer on Sunday Brunch presented Teesside native and former X Factor contestant Amelia Lily with a chicken parmo on the show.
On 8 March 2018, Newcastle-born chef Anthony O'Shaughnessy served a Teesside-style chicken parmo on MasterChef UK Series 14 as part of a menu inspired by the North-East of England. The dish was judged by previous winners of the show and was very highly rated despite its appearance.

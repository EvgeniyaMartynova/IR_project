=== Key to tables ===
Track: Name of the track. Either the current name of the track (as it exists today) or the last known name of the track is shown.

Note that this figure may differ in various sources depending on the method that NASCAR or other sanctioning bodies have used to measure the track.
Location: The state (or province, for Canadian tracks) and city (or nearest city) where each track is located.
Named race(s): For many years, specific names have been given to races during a given season as a way of marketing the event. Where these names are known, they are noted next to the seasons in which that name was used.
Season(s): NASCAR seasons in which the track hosted an event. Note that only points-paying races are counted as part of a given series' season; tracks where additional exhibition or special races have been held are included in a separate table.

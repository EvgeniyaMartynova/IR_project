Gangan Comics

Gangan (ガンガン, Gangan) is a manga imprint of Square Enix Holdings. It originated as a manga imprint for Enix before the company re-branded as Square Enix. It publishes manga in several magazines aimed at different reader demographic groups in the Japanese market. Its magazines are home to some popular manga series which were adapted into anime series, like Fullmetal Alchemist, Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit, Nabari no Ou, Inu x Boku SS, and Soul Eater. The comics are later collected in paperback volumes under brand names such as Gangan Comics (ガンガンコミックス, Gangan Komikkusu), Gangan Comics Joker (ガンガンコミックスJOKER, Gangan Komikkusu Jōkā) and Young Gangan Comics (ヤングガンガンコミックス, Yangu Gangan Komikkusu), which identify the magazine of serialisation. These paperback brand names are formed by deleting any Gekkan (月刊, monthly publication) or Shōnen (少年, boy) in the magazine name and inserting Comics (コミックス, Komikkusu) directly after the word "Gangan".

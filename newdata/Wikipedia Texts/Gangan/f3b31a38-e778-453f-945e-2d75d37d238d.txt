In addition, he moderates two radio broadcasts for LORA Munich and is co-editor of the literary magazine Ausser.dem. He is a member of the poetry group Rhyme Free and was from 2008 to 2011 participant in the Darmstadt Text Workshop Kurt Drawert. Together with Karin Fellner, he is considered one of the driving forces in the development of a contemporary Munich lyric poetry scene. Armin Steigenberger mainly writes poetry, but also published a novel and wrote plays. 
Numerous texts also appeared in literary journals (e.g. Das Gedicht, lauter niemand, NDL, Ostragehege) and anthologies (e.g. Versnetze).
Steigenberger moderated the one-hour radio program "Beautiful Stuttering", from 2007 to 2015, together with Enrico Strathausen. The program offered information on stuttering, but above all on the social perception of stuttering and the associated exclusion. The program was perceived as a successful attempt to counteract social discrimination against stuttering people. The fact that both moderators themselves stuttered was a peculiarity and was considered a taboo because stuttering people would not normally have access to the radio and television media.Armin Steigenberger is married and lives in Munich.

Black House (MMA)

Black House (Casa Preta) is a mixed martial arts fighting team and gym based out of Brazil.  Opened on November 27, 2006, Black House was started by former Brazilian Top Team member and black belt Carlos "Carlão" Barreto, Jorge Guimaraes and Rogerio Camoes.  Guimaraes acted as the team's manager and Camoes was in charge of the team's training.
Fighters on the team include Anderson Silva, Lyoto Machida, Antônio Rogério Nogueira, Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira, Pedro Rizzo, Erick Silva, Rafael Cavalcante and former Chute Boxe Academy fighter Antonio "Nino" Schembri.
In addition to training fighters, the gym offers classes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, Boxing and American Wrestling.  The facility features an octagon, a boxing ring, and two dojos in the workout space.


== Re-branding and re-location ==
Despite the team's recent success in the UFC with the championships held by Silva, Machida and Nogueira, there had been much unrest due to non-competition related affairs.  It appears that the team has moved or will be moving from their current location at X-Gym due to unresolvable disputes, and in a December 2007 interview Anderson Silva was quoted as stating that due to certain 'brand problems' the name Black House was likely to change following the move. On May 16, 2008, Silva and Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira opened the Nogueira and Silva Mixed Martial Arts Academy in Miami, Florida.Despite these events, in a recent interview on April 23, 2009 with Sherdog Radio host Jordan Breen, Black House manager Ed Soares indicated that Black House may open a new training location in Los Angeles, California.  He also shed light on some of the issues that led many to believe that the team had disbanded, most notably the team management's falling out with the owners of X-Gym, the original location and headquarters for their training camps.

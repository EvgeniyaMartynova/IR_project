The Black House

The Black House (1981) is a collection of short stories by American author Patricia Highsmith. 


== Overview ==
An intense, macabre anthology focusing not only on murder, but also on more unusual crimes and misdemeanours that are beyond the reaches of prosecution. Told in Highsmith's typically impassive, lucid writing style, the work has been noted for its high degree of tension and, in some cases, surrealism.

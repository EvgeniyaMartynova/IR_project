== Reception ==
The film received generally positive reviews from film critics. Amos Lassen wrote "All of us love surprises and “Welcome to New York” is filled with them”. “Heading the cast is Sherry Vine as Dr. Kitty Rosenblatt, a very unorthodox psychiatrist who has quite a successful practice (and who is absolutely hysterical in her role)”. He add: “Steven Tylor O’Connor directed and he should be very proud of this clever little film. This is the second film of his that I have seen and I can say that he is one of the new directors to watch. If “Welcome to New York” is an omen of what we can expect from him then we are very lucky”.Scott’s Movie said, "Welcome to New York is a perfectly charming film”. “One of the funniest moments in the flick is the look on Nick Page’s face when Vine expresses befuddlement over the notion of working as a drag queen”. “Ms. Vine is very funny, and in a way that doesn’t rely on the inherent humor of a man dressing as a woman. For some reason, she reminds me a lot of the actor Sylvia Miles”. “The strongest  scenario involving a very appealing Megan Kane and Matthew Watson and an awkward first date with Sean Paul Lockhart and Alex Ringler that could have been drawn from a Seinfeld episode. Lockhart is particularly endearing as an apparent young innocent”. “Perhaps the best compliment I can pay O’Connor’s movie is that it ended too soon. It could easily be expanded to feature length. While it is clearly low-budget, it does not look cheap. And it has a nifty soundtrack that includes tracks by Eric Williams, Brandon Hilton, Bryan Fenkart and Chris Salvatore”.

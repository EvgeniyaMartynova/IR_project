=== Critical response ===
Rajeev Masand of News 18 severely criticized the film saying that, "Welcome to New York isn’t merely a bad film, or even a terrible one. It’s depressing. Not because the plot is all over the place (it is!), not because the actors appear to be doing whatever they like (they are!), and not because it has no vision or ambition (it doesn’t!) – but because it’s an exercise in sheer pointlessness. Really, this film has no reason to exist." and gave it a rating of 1 out of 5. Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 0.5 out of 5 and concluded his review by saying that, "Welcome To New York is totally lost in New York, and looks nothing more than an extended IIFA trailer. It’s not worth wasting your time, money, patience and intelligence on this mind-numbing promotional video.". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 and said that, "Welcome To New York turns out to be a limp, lame tribute to Bollywood"..

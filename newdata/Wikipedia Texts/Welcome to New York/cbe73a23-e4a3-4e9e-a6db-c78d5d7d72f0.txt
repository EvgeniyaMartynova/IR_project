Welcome to New York (TV series)

Welcome to New York is an American sitcom television series created by Barbara Wallace and Thomas R. Wolfe, that aired on CBS. The show premiered October 11, 2000, and aired until January 17, 2001. CBS canceled the show due to low ratings.  Looking back, Gaffigan said, "I don’t think I had the maturity to take the authority I should have", and as he was not a contributing writer he felt the team would dismiss his ideas.


== Premise ==
The show starred Jim Gaffigan, who played a weatherman from Fort Wayne, Indiana, who then moved to New York City and worked as a meteorologist for a fictional morning news show called "AM New York". Christine Baranski played Marsha Bickner, the larger-than-life, tightly-wound producer of "AM New York" who hired Jim, but tends to forget the details about his life – like where he moved from.

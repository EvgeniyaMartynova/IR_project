Dangerous Curves (album)

Dangerous Curves is the fifth studio album by American hard rock/heavy metal singer and guitarist Lita Ford, released in 1991. Though it was a popular release and received heavy video rotation on MTV, the album was not as successful as its predecessor due to the sound of the album sounding largely 80s (because of the fact that the album's genre is glam metal) and musical tastes were shifting towards alternative rock in late 1991. The album charted on both the US and UK charts in 1992 and the single, "Shot of Poison", was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in 1993. This was Lita Ford's second ever Grammy nomination and her first since 1984's "Dancin' On The Edge".The track "Black Widow" is not to be confused for the track "Die for Me Only (Black Widow)" from Ford's 1983 debut Out for Blood.

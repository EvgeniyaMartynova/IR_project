=== Spain ===
In Spain, there is a Ministry of the Interior's National Police centralized academy near Ávila (40.666044°N 4.653832°W﻿ / 40.666044; -4.653832.) The Guardia Civil runs two centralized academies, one for enlisted guardias and sub-officers in Baeza (Jaén, 37.995590°N 3.480421°W﻿ / 37.995590; -3.480421) and another one for commanding officers in two campuses at Aranjuez (40.052223°N 3.600720°W﻿ / 40.052223; -3.600720) and El Escorial (40.599491°N 4.132105°W﻿ / 40.599491; -4.132105) (Madrid). The autonomous Catalan and Basque police forces —the Mossos d'Esquadra and the Ertzaintza— also have their own centralized academies in Mollet del Vallès (Barcelona, 41.551442°N 2.221305°E﻿ / 41.551442; 2.221305) and Arcaute (Álava, 42.858187°N 2.618719°W﻿ / 42.858187; -2.618719). No candidates with a criminal record are accepted.
Candidates attend these centralized public academies after passing the police force's entry examination, so they are already enlisted and will automatically become police officers if they don't fail the course or drop out. Their training is thus free of charge and the candidates are paid a police cadet's wage as members of the force. Basic training ranges from 5 months for an entry-level policía nacional or guardia civil to 9 months for a mosso, but it actually takes about 18 months to two years including the practice placement and additional training. Local police forces including Madrid's or Barcelona's are often trained at these large public academies too. High-rank or highly specialized courses are longer and eventually similar to a college degree.
The Spanish police academies must not be confused with the many fee-paying private academias training potential candidates to pass the entry examination beforehand. While these private academies may be helpful, studying at them is not requested or asked and potential candidates can take the entry examination on their own.

Training ranges from a SCQF Level 7 for the probationer training delivered to new recruits (equivalent to an entry level higher education course) to degree level qualifications for more specialised or senior roles such as detective training or courses for senior officers.


=== United States ===
Police academies exist in every state and at the federal level. Each state has an agency which certifies police academies and their programs. Most states have minimum physical and academic standards for cadets to achieve before they can enter an academy and graduate. There may be additional or higher standards required for later certification as a police officer. While some states allow open enrollment in police academies, many require cadets to be hired by a police department in order to attend. Departments and/or state certifying agencies may also require individuals to pass background checks, psychological evaluations, polygraph exams, drug screenings and qualify with a firearm and demonstrate driving skills, as conditions of employment/certification.


==== Federal ====
While some federal law enforcement agencies have their own training requirements and training facilities, 91 federal law enforcement agencies (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Marshals Service), requires agents/officers and prospective agents/officers to attend basic and in-service training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC). FLETC, which is operated by the Department of Homeland Security, is headquartered in Glynco, Georgia and has training sites in Artesia, New Mexico, Charleston, South Carolina and Cheltenham, Maryland.


==== Connecticut ====
In Connecticut, police officer recruits receive a certification to enforce the General Statutes. Their training is conducted at "The Connecticut Police Academy" located at 285 Preston Avenue, in Meriden, CT. In order to become a certified police officer, a recruit must be a legal United States resident at least 21 years of age, have a high school diploma or equivalent, possess a valid drivers license, and not be convicted of any felonies. The to be officers then have to attend an 818-hour basic training course that covers various aspects of police work.

==== Florida ====
In Florida, police academies are primarily run by community colleges or state agencies. All law enforcement officers in the state are certified as such by a governing body appointed by the governor called the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission under the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. All applicants must pass a state examination and be hired by a law enforcement agency within 4 years to be considered certified.


==== Kentucky ====
All law enforcement officers in Kentucky (except as listed below) hired after 1998 are required to complete the minimum screening, physical training and classroom requirements of the Kentucky Police Officer Professional Standards (POPS) prior to being certified and acting as a law enforcement officer. Larger agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police as well as the Louisville Metro Police and the Lexington Division of Police, operate their own police academies and may have requirements that exceed the minimum POPS standards. Agencies in Kentucky who do not run their own academies send their prospective officers to a 16-week basic training class at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Academy, operated by the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and  located on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, in order to complete their POPS requirements. The only exception to POPS training and certification are officers hired prior to 1998 and elected law enforcement officers whose duties and requirements are set forth in the Kentucky Constitution. These include sheriffs, constables, coroners and jailers (but generally not their deputies).  Many of these office holders, however, hold POPS certification from previous employment as a law enforcement officer prior to their election and others will receive POPS certification or approved equivalent training before taking office.


==== Maryland ====
In Maryland, the Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission is the civilian governing body that sets standards for law enforcement personnel within the state. Most major law enforcement agencies operate their own academy in which recruits must pass over 550 objectives including (but not limited to): criminal and traffic law, officer safety techniques, defensive tactics, report writing, a 40-hour block of emergency vehicle operations, a 40-hour block of First Responder, and a 40-hour block of weapon training. Most agencies operate non-resident academies; however, the Maryland State Police requires recruits to live at the academy and, dependent on their performance level for the week, may leave campus for the weekend. Many colleges such as the University of Maryland and other community colleges offer police academy instruction as well.


==== Michigan ====
In Michigan, in order to become law enforcement officers, any and all applicants have the option to be certified by the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards or MCOLES. All persons wishing to become police officers in the State of Michigan must be certified through MCOLES. Cadets must pass a physical fitness exam as well as a reading and writing exam. Applicants also cannot have any felonies, weapons violations, or a history of domestic violence posted on their criminal records. Police academies are most often part of community colleges, city or county police and sheriff departments, or the Michigan State Police.
At the end of the police academy, candidates take the MCOLES test. Upon successful completion, candidates are 'certifiable' and have a period of one year to obtain a job (if not sponsored by an agency). If a candidate is unable to obtain a police job within that year, and if the candidate wishes to be considered in the future, he/she must attend a two-week re-certification course, which adds another year to the window of opportunity.


==== New Hampshire ====
New Hampshire's PSTC (Police Standards and Training Council) provides all initial training and maintains certification standards for every full and part-time law enforcement officer in the state. This includes anyone who has the power of arrest (except federal officers) under New Hampshire law.   PSTC also provides initial training and certification for correctional officers employed directly by the State. All recruits must have at least a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, have a background check and pass a medical exam and a physical fitness test. Each agency may add other qualifications such as education, polygraph and drug exams. The PSTC law enforcement academies require each recruit to qualify with a firearm, demonstrate driving skills, maintaining physical fitness, pass subject matter exams and, scenario evaluations as a condition of certification.Most agencies in the state use a Field Training Officer program to provide additional training and evaluation of new hires.


==== Texas ====
The agency which certifies police academies in Texas is the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). Many major cities and sheriff's offices operate their own training academies, while some smaller municipalities cooperate to maintain regional academies. Some community colleges also offer police training courses. There are three state-level law enforcement academies: the Texas Department of Public Safety trains state troopers, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department trains game wardens, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice trains state corrections officers. Police academies typically last from 18 to 30 weeks, though there are many variations. All police cadets are required to obtain at least a Basic Peace Officer Proficiency Certification from TCOLE before beginning active duty; some academies require their cadets to obtain an Intermediate certification before graduating. TCOLE also offers certifications for jailers and corrections officers, who must also undergo training prior to being commissioned (albeit typically much less than full-fledged police officers).


==== Utah ====
The basis of the Utah basic training for police academy is to protect the community and the citizens the police are serving. They do this by basic training, firearms training, curriculum development, canine training, defensive tactics, emergency vehicle operations, and physical fitness. Training for Utah officers is broken into two separate sections, called blocks. The two blocks are special functions and law enforcement. In order to be certified in the state of Utah an individual must successfully finish both courses of training. This training is provided so that the officers may be as professional and as up to date as possible. Along with the original training, officers are also required to do an additional 40 hours of training annually in order to stay up to date on all current laws and police procedures.

Virginia International University

Virginia International University (VIU) is a private, non-profit institution established in 1998.  Located in Fairfax, Virginia, VIU offers degree programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as language programs like English as a Second Language (ESL), and continuing education opportunities. The university is nationally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools and approved to operate by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.


== History ==
Virginia International University was founded by Dr. Isa Sarac in 1998.  Subsequent to establishing its campus in Fairfax, Virginia, VIU received authorization from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) to begin its first Master of Business Administration (MBA) program on December 23, 1998.By May 2000, SCHEV granted the university the authority to offer a series of Diploma and Certificate programs, grant degrees for the MBA program, and gave the university permission to begin a baccalaureate program in Computer Science and Business Management.
VIU held its first commencement on May 4, 2006 with 20 graduates in attendance at the Fairfax County Country Club and has rapidly grown in student population since then. Today, VIU boasts students from 60 different countries and offers a variety of both academic and non-academic degrees on campus and online.In the fall of 2018, SCHEV staff audited VIU and recommended that the council revoke the university's certificate to operate. The audit "found numerous concerns about the quality of the online courses it reviewed [and] state[d] that 'the single most important factor contributing to the substandard quality of online education at VIU is the institutionâ€™s acceptance of international students with an abysmally poor command of the English language. This is especially true for graduate level programs.'" The council subsequently accepted the staff recommendation and began the process of revoking the university's certificate to operate.In 2019 VIU reached a consent agreement with the State of Virginia to continue operating, but it must not offer online courses for at least three years.

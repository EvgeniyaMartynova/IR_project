He left the established Church of Scotland in the Disruption of 1843 to become one of the founders of the Free Church of Scotland. His first charge was Auchterarder Free Church. Although this might look a remote and irrelevant posting, Auchterarder was central to the entire Disruption, so the post actually had a kudos at the time, and could be viewed as important as a posting to one of the major cities at that time.He served as professor of theology at the Free Church College in Aberdeen from 1854 to 1857, and then as Professor of New Testament Exegesis at New College, Edinburgh from 1857 until his death.He died at home, 13 South Mansionhouse Road in Edinburgh on 14 April 1889 and is buried in the Grange Cemetery with his wife Janet Helen Goold (d.1893).

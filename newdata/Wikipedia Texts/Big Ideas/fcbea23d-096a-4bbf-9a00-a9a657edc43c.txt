== History ==
The origins of Big Ideas Learning go back to 1980, when mathematics textbook author Ron Larson started a small company called Larson Texts.  The company became incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1992 and became Larson Texts, Inc.In 2008, the owners of Larson Texts formed a separate publishing company called Big Ideas Learning.  Big Ideas Learning develops and publishes mathematics textbooks.  The name of the company is related to the 2006 "Focal Point" recommendations of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.  In September 2006, NCTM released Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence. In the Focal Points, NCTM identifies what it believes to be the most important mathematical topics ("the big ideas") for each grade level, including the related ideas, concepts, skills, and procedures that form the foundation for understanding and lasting learning.
In 2017 Big Ideas Learning announced a new partnership with National Geographic Learning (NGL), a Cengage company.  National Geographic Learning is the sole distributor of the Big Ideas Math programs.

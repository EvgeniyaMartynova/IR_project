Big Ideas (Pub Philosophy)

Pub Philosophy is a term sometimes used to describe organised gatherings in public houses for philosophical discussion. Several series of events in the United Kingdom and elsewhere offer pub philosophy in a variety of formats, typically involving an invited speaker and some degree of open discussion. Among the more long-standing of these are:

Big Ideas (based in London, UK) https://web.archive.org/web/20100912055756/http://bigi.org.uk/
Kant's Cave (held in London, UK, by Philosophy For All)
Living Philosophy (based in Tintern, Wales UK)
PhiloMadrid (based in Madrid, Spain)
Philosophy In Pubs (based in Liverpool, UK) http://www.philosophyinpubs.co.uk
PIPS Brighton (based in Brighton, UK) http://www.pips-brighton.org.uk/
The Stoa (based in Faversham, Kent, UK)
Skeptics in the Pub
Thinking While Drinking (based in San Diego, California) http://thinkingwhiledrinking.orgPub Philosophy groups, while often run by amateurs, have sometimes been recruited by more mainstream institutions to provide a distinctively participatory public forum. Such alliances have included Tate Liverpool and University of Chester working with Philosophy in Pubs, the Brighton Science Festival 2010 working with PIPS Brighton and the London School of Economics producing an event in collaboration with Big Ideas.

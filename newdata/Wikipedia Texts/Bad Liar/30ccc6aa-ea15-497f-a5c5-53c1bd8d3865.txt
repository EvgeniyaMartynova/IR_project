"Bad Liar" was co-written by Imagine Dragons lead vocalist Dan Reynolds and his wife Aja Volkman shortly before they separated. However, Reynolds has said the couple did not end up going through with the divorce.The Norwegian progressive rock band Maraton pointed out that the cover image for their single "Blood Music" is the same as Imagine Dragons’ cover image for "Bad Liar", with only the coloration being different. Maraton’s single was released in February 2018, while Imagine Dragons’ song dropped six months later in November 2018. Despite the undeniable shared artwork, Maraton released a statement revealing they had purchased the artwork from an artist called Beeple_crap, but had no deal giving them exclusive rights to the photo.

Hendrix (crater)

Hendrix is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the Moon's far side, deep in the southern hemisphere. Hendrix lies about a crater diameter to the south-southwest of the crater White, just beyond the outer rim of the enormous walled plain Apollo. This is a roughly circular, bowl-shaped crater. The rim is sharp-edged and not noticeably eroded. The interior is relatively featureless.
The crater is named after Don Hendrix.

Dutch Boy Paint

The Dutch Boy Group is a paint manufacturing company currently headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. Founded in 1907 by the National Lead Company, the Dutch Boy Paints brand is currently a subsidiary of the Consumer Group division of the Sherwin-Williams Company, which acquired it in 1980, two years after the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's directive banning the manufacturing of lead housepaint went into effect.

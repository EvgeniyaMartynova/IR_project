Pure and Simple (Joan Jett album)

Pure and Simple is the ninth studio album by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, released in 1994.
Pure and Simple was the first album to feature a new line up of Blackheart band members since the departure of longtime guitarist Ricky Byrd and bassist Kasim Sulton after the release of Jett's last album, Notorious. This new line up consisted of legendary bassist Kenny Aaronson and lead guitarist Tony "Bruno" Rey. Pure and Simple would be the last Joan Jett & the Blackhearts release until 2006's Sinner. In 1995, both Aaronson and Rey went on to other projects. Aaronson would eventually become a member of the reunited New York Dolls â€“ coincidentally taking over for bassist Sami Yaffa, his replacement in the Blackhearts and Rey became the musical director for Enrique Iglesias and pop sensation Rihanna.
"Hostility" and "World of Denial" are added on the Japanese pressings. The Japanese cover differs from regular cover. "Get Off the Cross" was also recorded during these sessions. Concurrently released in the US on vinyl LP, CD, and cassette, all versions varying slightly. The record album came with a hype sticker that read "All Rock. No Ballads" and features the track "Here to Stay" co-written by Jett and Kat Bjelland. A few seconds of the song are also heard on the cassette at the very end of Side One before fading out. Jett independently put out "Spinster" as a 7-inch blue vinyl single in the US with a picture sleeve. The B-sides were "Go Home" and "Hostility". The track "World of Denial" was eventually released in the US on Jett's greatest hits album Fit to Be Tied.

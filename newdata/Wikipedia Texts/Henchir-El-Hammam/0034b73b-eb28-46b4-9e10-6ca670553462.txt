Baia, Numidia

Baia was an ancient city and bishopric in the Roman province of Africa Proconsulare. It is a Roman Catholic titular see.


== History ==
Baia, identified as modern Henchir-Settara or Henchir-El-Hammam in present-day Algeria, was among the many towns that were important enough in the Roman province of Numidia to become a suffragan diocese in the papal sway.
Five of its Catholic Bishops are historically recorded:

Felix participated in a synod called by bishop Gratus of Carthage in 349
Beianus, on the side of Maximianus of Carthage against the Donatist heresy in 394.
Valentinus attended as Catholic bishop the Council of Carthage in 411, held by the command of the (Western) Roman Emperor Honorius, as did his Donatist counterpart Quintasius, on that very heresy.
Valentinus participated as Primate of Numidia the synod of Carthage in 419, regarding the question of appeals to Rome.

== Titular see ==
The diocese was nominally restored (again?) in 1933 as Latin Titular bishopric of Baia (Latin = Curiate Italian) / Baianen(sis) (Latin adjective).
It has had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank :

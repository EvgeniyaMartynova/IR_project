Wells & Young's Brewery

Wells & Young's Brewery (Wells & Young's Brewing Company) was formed in October 2006 from the merger of the brewing operations of Charles Wells Ltd and Young's Brewery. Charles Wells initially had a 60% stake and Young's 40%. In 2011, Charles Wells took full control when it bought Young's 40% stake. Wells & Young's is now responsible for brewing, distributing and marketing Charles Wells' and Young & Co's brands at the Eagle Brewery in Bedford.At the beginning of 2007, Wells and Young's made its first big investment and bought the Courage brands which included Courage Best and Courage Directors.
As well as brewing its own brands, the brewery contract brews other beers including Kirin Ichiban and Estrella Damm.As well as selling its brands to all the Charles Wells Pub Company sites and the Young's Company sites, Wells and Young's supplies hundreds of 'free trade' sites and other pub company sites (including Enterprise Inns, Punch, Spirit, Admiral Taverns and Stonegate Pub Company) as well as major supermarkets such as Sainsbury's, Tesco, Aldi, Lidl, Morrisons and ASDA.
The company's 'International Sales' department is also in growth with distribution to the USA, Canada, Russia, Japan, Europe and Australia.
Following a full rebrand in early 2015, the company went back to its roots and traded as Charles Wells once again, reuniting the different arms of the business under its founding name.
In May 2017, Charles Wells announced that it was selling the brewery and wine business to Marston's Brewery together with the Bombardier and McEwan's brands and rights to the Young's brands. It said it would set up a separate brewery in Bedford to brew Charles Wells-branded beers in two years' time.

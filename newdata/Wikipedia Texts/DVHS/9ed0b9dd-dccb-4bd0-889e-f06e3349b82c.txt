== History ==
In 1956, Del Valle Junior-Senior High School was built to serve grades seven through ten, and grade eleven was added 1957, and a mascot and colors were chosen. During that year, grade twelve was added as was the Cardinal field. Eventually, a new junior-high school was built and served grades seven and eight and an athletic and physical-education field was approved for both the junior high and high school. As time went on, other common school districts kept joining the Colorado Common School District, a.k.a. Del Valle Independent School District (DVISD), and when the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport was built, Del Valle High School and all other DVISD schools were relocated to their current locations. In 2000, the new high-school was built on its present site, and in 2007 the district passed another bond-issue, which money was used to relocate the Del Valle Opportunity Center, a new elementary and middle-school were built, and a ninth-grade academy, which is annexed to the high school.

=== Formation and original line-up ===
Be Quiet. Shout Loud! formed around February 2008 from the ashes of Teesside Band 'Secret Signal'. The original line-up was Jake Radio (vocals), Macca (guitar), Big Dave (bass), Chris Burton (keyboards) and Paul Morton (drums). 
Around June 2008 Michael Snowden joined on drums with Paul moving over to Synth and second drummer duties. Since then the band has seen a few minor changes with current guitarist Jamie Donnelly taking over from Paul Macca McCullagh in 2017.
In early June 2018 a sixth member was added to the band when Daryl "The Cat" Takahashi joined to play synth and to be a comfort to the other band members. Rumour has it that he flew in from Japan to join Be Quiet! Shout Loud. for their acclaimed appearance at Evolution Emerging on 9 June 2018 at the Mustangs Alley stage.

With over 100 gigs under their belts, the band has supported such acts as Iglu & Hartly, Electric 6, The Chapman Family, One Night Only, Team Waterpolo,  Kaizers Orchestra, Toyah and East 17, while playing at Middlesbrough Music Live, Beached Festival, Stockton Callin, Twisterella, Music Box, Last Train Home and Olgas Rock festivals.

The band has released numerous singles and a live album since their formation. Their first single was "Disco Beat" in 2009 with their latest single "No Hope" being released on 10 October 2018. The bands newest album 'Another Commotion' was released on 26 October 2018 and is supported by numerous tour dates and festival appearances.


=== David Wheater ===
In early 2008 a video appeared on YouTube of Middlesbrough F.C. defender David Wheater dancing to 'You'll never know how to dance (Unless you're dancin' with us)' which was later named as the number-three dancing-footballer video by The Daily Mirror.

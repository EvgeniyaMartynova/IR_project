Duri (name)

Duri, also spelled Doori, is a Korean unisex given name.


== Meaning ==
Unlike most Korean names, which are composed of two Sino-Korean roots each written with one hanja, "Duri" is an indigenous Korean name. It is a Gyeongsang dialect word for "two", as well as a homophone of a differently-spelled standard Korean word (둘이) meaning "two people" or "a couple". The name was attested as early as the 19th century, and is one of a number of indigenous names which became more popular in South Korea in the late 20th century.The name Duri could also be recorded in hanja which are picked solely for their sound and not for their meaning (for example, 斗里 or 乧伊). There are 12 hanja with the reading "du" and 26 hanja with the reading "ri" on the South Korean government's official list of hanja which may be registered for use in given names.

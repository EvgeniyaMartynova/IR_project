Fire & Ice (Kaskade album)

Fire & Ice is the seventh studio album by American DJ and producer Kaskade. It was released on October 25, 2011 in the United States through Ultra Records.


== Reception ==
The album debuted at No. 17 on the Billboard Top 200 chart and at No. 1 on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart, becoming Kaskade's first number-one on the latter. It also charted at number 6 on the Digital Albums chart and number 3 on the Independent Albums chart. The album received mixed reviews from mainstream critics.
Fire & Ice earned Kaskade his first Grammy nomination for Best Dance/Electronic Album in the 2013 Grammy Awards. Eventually, his next studio album Atmosphere met with similar success.


== Music videos ==
Most of the album's singles have supporting music videos (with the exceptions of "Lessons in Love" and "Llove").


=== "Eyes" ===
The music video for the song "Eyes" was uploaded to YouTube by the Ultra Records channel on September 13, 2011.
The video features Mindy Gledhill singing, scenes of nature and city streets, usage of the mirroring effect and a 3D computer-animated eyeball, but it does not feature Kaskade.


=== "Turn It Down" ===
The music video for the track "Turn It Down" was uploaded to YouTube by Kaskade's VEVO channel on October 27, 2011.
It features Rebecca & Fiona among others in scenes of ice-skating and raving. There are also scenes of colorful animated lips glowing in the dark syncing with the lyrics, referencing the single's cover art. Kaskade does not make an appearance in this video either.


=== "Room for Happiness" ===
There are two music videos for "Room for Happiness"; both were uploaded to YouTube by the Ultra Records channel on February 24, 2012.  The first video, subtitled "Fire" (as it is the version from the Fire disc of the album), features both Kaskade and, primarily, Skylar Grey. Kaskade is seen either DJing or watching Skylar Grey in a virtual-reality type room with a bed (alluding to the single's cover art) that he controls. Grey is seen singing in the room while it changes scenery. The scenery changes between a dark forest, a room of fire and a sunny desert (after the room walls break down).  The second video, for Kaskade's ICE Mix of the song, has a few differences. This version is over a minute longer and opens with Grey lying on the bed of the room while in the scenery of a burnt-down forest (not seen in the "Fire" video), and Kaskade opens in a different room instead of a hallway. Other things not seen in the "Fire" video are Grey laying her head on the rim of the bed (also alluding to the single's cover art) and singing to the camera knowing Kaskade is watching. The video for "Kaskade's ICE Mix", although, does not have the scenes of Kaskade DJing, the room of fire or Grey singing in the sunny desert room (because the "walls" break down at the end of the video instead of the middle).


=== "Lick It" ===
The music video for "Lick It" was uploaded to YouTube by the Ultra Records channel on April 18, 2012.
This video does not include Kaskade or Skrillex, but instead a woman in a snow-filled area, presumably on a "green screen". As she is walking, and as the song progresses, blood is getting sucked into her head, causing her pain. She keeps her hands over her ears during most of the video due of this. When she asks for help, she is avoided. She tries to chase down a man with headphones to help her, but he flees. Afterwards, it is shown that time is actually in a reversed flow in the place around her (noticeably because the blood actually came from her ears and was left on the snow and the snow from her shoe print goes back in place as she steps on it). After breaking through a window to retrieved headphones, the pain stops as she notices people around her starting to go outside.

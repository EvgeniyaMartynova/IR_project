Luigi Mozzi

Luigi Mozzi (born at Bergamo 26 May 1746; died near Milan 24 June 1813) was an Italian Jesuit controversialist.


== Life ==
He entered the Society of Jesus in 1763, and on its suppression was received into the Diocese of Bergamo, where he was shortly made a canon, and appointed archpriest and examiner of candidates for the priesthood. The zeal with which he opposed the progress of Jansenism in Italy gained him a reputation, and Pope Pius VI called him to Rome, where he became an Apostolic missionary. 
He was elected a member of the Accademia degli Arcadi. In 1804 he rejoined the Society, which had been restored in Naples. He retired to the residence of Marquis Scotti near Milan, where he died.

Ukraine Crisis Media Center

UCMC was founded in March 2014 with the efforts of leading Ukrainian experts in the sphere of international relations [1], communications and public relations. It was established to help Ukraine amplify its voice on the international arena  [2] about the events connected to annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.
Following the election of President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019, some of whose actions the UCMC strongly disagree with, the UCMC with the support of many Ukrainian NGOs issued a statement of an extensive list of "red lines not to be crossed" by the new administration, asserting if they were it "will inevitably lead to political instability in our country".


== Funding ==
The activities of UCMC are enabled with support of its partners: Public Affairs department of the Embassy of the United States, Kiev; International Renaissance Foundation; National Endowment for Democracy (USA); Ukrainian World Foundation (Canada); European Endowment for Democracy (EU); Matra Programme (Embassy of the Netherlands in Ukraine); Internews Agency; Mondelez International and others.

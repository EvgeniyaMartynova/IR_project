A story about a mother who tries to protect her daughter out of love but inflicts pain instead, the drama series was based on the same-titled novel written by Kim Soo-hyun. It was also adapted into the 1992 film Flower in Snow starring Yoon Jeong-hee and Lee Mi-yeon.


== Plot ==
When she was young, Yoo Da-mi (Go Ara) was forced to move in with her grandmother. Her father subsequently disappeared from her life, and since then, she'd always believed that he'd died. As time passes, her mother Lee Kang-ae (Kim Hee-ae) becomes one of the country's bestselling authors. Consequently, she never found time to spend with her daughter. One day, Da-mi accidentally intercepts a phone call from her father, Yoo Geon-hee (Lee Jae-ryong), and realizes that her mother has lied to her all these years about her father's whereabouts. Angry, Da-mi rebels by deciding not to go to college, despite having excellent grades in high school. On a whim, she accompanies her friend to an audition, and becomes an actress instead. Coincidentally, the first film Da-mi stars in is based on one of Kang-ae's novels. During one of their heated arguments, Da-mi tells her mother that she's going to Japan to search for her father. Meanwhile, at her side is her boss's stepbrother, Ha Young-chan (Kim Kibum), a family friend who secretly loves Da-mi and keeps helping her even though she's rejected his feelings.

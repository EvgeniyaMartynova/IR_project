Moberly Area Community College

Moberly Area Community College (MACC) is a public community college based in Moberly, Missouri.  In addition to the Moberly campus, MACC has five satellite campus sites across a large portion of Northeastern and central Missouri: Columbia, Hannibal, Kirksville, Macon, and Mexico. The college is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2010 MACC enrollment was approximately 5,600 students.


== History ==

MACC was founded in 1927 as Moberly Junior College as a part of the Moberly Public School system. Temporary facilities housed the classes until 1931 when a permanent building was constructed on 29 acres, which would today be the current MACC campus. The college experienced rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s, especially after a public vote led to the establishment of a community college district encompassing a 16-county area in northern and central Missouri. During this time, MACC gained accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1990, the school was renamed Moberly Area Community College.Major campus improvements include the $2.5 Million dollar Fine Arts wing constructed in 1984, providing a new library, classrooms, 600-seat auditorium, and Student Commons area. The Career Center was also expanded by nearly 22,000 square feet, allowing the consolidation of all vocational programs. College Hall, later renamed Komar Hall in honor of longtime MACC President Dr. Andrew Komar, Jr., was built in 1993. The large three-story structure provided space for Administrative and business offices along with new chemistry, physics, and biology classrooms and labs. Fitzsimmons-Johns Arena, named for the two most successful basketball coaches in MACC history, Cotton Fitzsimmons and Maury John, is the home court for MACC Greyhounds men's and women's basketball as well as Missouri high school basketball playoff games and music concerts. One of the newest additions to the MACC-Moberly campus is the McCormick Commons and Residential Center, built in 2007. The 2,700-foot commons provides recreational activities, a computer lab, and laundry room while also serving as the main entry to the men's and women's dorms.


== Administration ==
The current President of MACC is Dr. Jeff Lashley. Evelyn Jorgenson, Ph.D held the position from 1996 until her retirement in June 2013. Jorgenson followed Andrew Komar, Jr., Ph.D, who oversaw major growth in the college during his 25 years as president. Doctor Komar serves as President Emeritus of MACC. In November 2012 Jorgensen accepted a position as president of Northwest Arkansas Community College effective July 1, 2012. On December 11, 2012 the MACC Board of Trustees announced that Jeff Lashley, Ph.D would succeed Jorgenson as president effective July 1, 2013. Lashley has been on the MACC staff since 1996, first as an instructor, then as Dean of Academic Affairs, then as Vice-President for Instruction, and now as President.

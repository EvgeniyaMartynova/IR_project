Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission

The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (Malay: Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia), abbreviated MACC or SPRM, (formerly known as Anti-Corruption Agency, ACA or Badan Pencegah Rasuah, BPR) is a government agency in Malaysia that investigates and prosecutes corruption in the public and private sectors. The MACC was modelled after top anti-corruption agencies, such as the Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong and the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales, Australia. 
There are five independent bodies that monitor the MACC to ensure its integrity and to protect citizen's rights. These bodies are managed separately from other government offices in order to provide an independent perspective. The five bodies are: the Anti-Corruption Advisory Board, the Special Committee on Corruption, the Complaints Committee, the Operations Review Panel, and the Corruption Consultation and Prevention Panel.The MACC is currently headed by Chief Commissioner Latheefa Koya, replacing Mohamad Shukri Abdull on 4 June 2019, following the former MACC chief's resignation amid the ongoing corruption probe of the MACC by the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government.

Craigmount was founded in Edinburgh in 1874 as a school for boys. In 1884, it was re-opened as a boarding school for girls. During the Second World War and the immediate post-war years (from 1939–52), the school was at Scone Palace, Perthshire. At the end of the summer term, 1952, it moved to Minto in the Borders, leasing Minto House. In 1962, Minto House was purchased for £20,000. In 1966, the  school was closed.

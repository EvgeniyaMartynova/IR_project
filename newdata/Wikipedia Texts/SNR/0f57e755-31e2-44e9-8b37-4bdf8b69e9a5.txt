== Fellows of the Society for Nautical Research (FSNR) ==
In 2011, the Chairman of the Society, Admiral Sir Kenneth Eaton suggested in his "The Way Forward" report that the Society create a system of fellowships, similar to that of other Learned societies, as a means of recognition, using the Post-nominal letters "FSNR". Eaton initially asked a small group to carry forward the idea and the result was a report to which the Society's Council agreed and the idea was put forward to the Annual General Meeting. It was agreed that election as a Fellow of the Society would be in recognition of the outstanding role that an individual had played in furthering the objectives of the Society as set forth in its constitution. This might be for long service as an officer or member of the Council, as an officer of the Society's committees, as an outstanding contributor to its publications, or as a member whose achievements in the field of maritime studies merit recognition.

Parsons Green

Parsons Green is a mainly residential district of Fulham in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The Green itself, which is roughly triangular, is bounded on two of its three sides by the New King's Road section of the King's Road, A308 road and Parsons Green Lane. The wider neighbourhood is bounded by the Harwood and Wandsworth Bridge Roads, A217 road to the East and Munster Road to the West, while the Fulham Road, A3219 road may be said to define its northern boundary. Its southern boundary is less clearly defined as it merges quickly and imperceptibly with the Peterborough estate and Hurlingham.
At its historic centre lie two open spaces, the Green itself and Eel Brook Common. The name stems from the original village green, after the former residence of the rectors of Fulham Parish. It is one of the Conservation areas in Hammersmith and Fulham, that extends from the borough boundary in the east to Fulham High Street in the west.


== History ==
Timber rights attached to the Green are mentioned in court rolls dating from 1391. In 1625 there were only six rated residents for the area. By 1706, John Bowack opined in his Antiquities of Middlesex that it "was inhabited mostly by gentry and persons of quality".Two cricket matches were held on Parsons Green in 1731 and 1733. The first was on Tuesday, 10 August 1731 between Fulham and Chelsea, Fulham winning. The second was on Tuesday, 26 June 1733 between the same two teams and played for a substantial prize of 30 guineas, although the result is unknown.In the 18th century, changes continued with the building of grand houses with grounds. These were bought by merchants and bankers from the City and not infrequently by members of the Court and their 'associations'. The area acquired a somewhat louche reputation at that time.Fulham F.C. had their ground in the park for two years from 1889. Early in the 20th century, a few test flights were carried out there with flying machines.
Parsons Green is referred to in an early poem by Sir John Betjeman, The Varsity Students Rag, as a place where the poem's protagonist is said to have a "run-in" with a policeman.On 15 September 2017 an IED exploded on a London Underground train injuring 29 people. The IED was placed in a bucket however did not detonate fully, with injuries being largely burn related. No fatalities were reported. An 18-year-old Iraqi refugee was arrested the next day at the Port of Dover. He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment, having found to have been in contact with members of Islamic State.

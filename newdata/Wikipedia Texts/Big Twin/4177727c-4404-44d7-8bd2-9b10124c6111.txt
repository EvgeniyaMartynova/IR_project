Martin County, Minnesota

Martin County is a county in Minnesota, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 20,840. Its county seat is Fairmont.


== History ==
The county was created by the Minnesota Territory legislature on 23 May 1857, with Fair Mount (which was also platted in 1857) designated as county seat. The town's name was later shortened to Fairmont. Two explanations have been advanced for the county's name. A delegate to the US congress from the Wisconsin Territory introduced the legislative act to organize the Minnesota Territory; his name was Morgan Lewis Martin. However, in 1904 the county's oldest residents attested that the name referred to Henry Martin, an early settler from Connecticut who ran several businesses during the pre-territory era.


== Geography ==
Martin County lies on the south side of Minnesota. Its south border abuts the north border of the state of Iowa.

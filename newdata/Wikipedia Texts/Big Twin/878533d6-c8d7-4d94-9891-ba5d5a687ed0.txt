Big Twin (video game)

Big Twin  is an adult puzzle arcade game released by Playmark in 1995 in Japan only. Align three identical balls in a row to make them disappear.


== Gameplay ==
Big Twin may be played by one player, or by two players simultaneously. Each player uses an eight-way joystick and one button. Throughout the game, spheres of different colors, some with animal faces, fall from the top of the playfield. Players must align those spheres into rows of three of the same color, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Once a sphere has landed in the playfield, and if it is not blocked by another sphere, the player may highlight it and drag it to another location by holding the button and moving the joystick.


=== One-player mode ===
At the start of the game, the player may choose to start at level 1 (beginner), level 5 (expert) or level 10 (advanced). As matching spheres are eliminated, a photograph of a mostly nude woman is gradually exposed. After clearing a stage, the player receives a bonus for matches made and a penalty for any unmatched spheres. If the balls pile up to the top of the screen, the game will be over. The game features power-ups to aid in removing spheres.


=== Two-player mode ===
Each player has 100 items drop one at a time. When one player completes seven groups of three balls in a level, an additional row of six items will be dumped on the other player's side of the screen. The game is over when one player's items reach the top of the screen, at which point that player loses, or when all 100 items have been dropped, at which point the total scores are tallied and the winner is the player with more points.

== Content ==
Lacking new material to release because of Elvis' infrequent studio recording sessions during this period, RCA Records assembled this album, consisting almost entirely  of previously released recordings.
According to Elvis: The Illustrated Record by Roy Carr and Mick Farren, all but one track on Welcome to My World had been previously issued. That track is "I Can't Stop Loving You", recorded during the afternoon performance at Madison Square Garden on June 10, 1972; the remainder of the concert remained unreleased until 1997 when it was issued as An Afternoon in the Garden. One track, Your Cheatin' Heart, dated back to 1958, 19 years previously.

Welcome to My World (Jim Reeves song)

"Welcome to My World" is a popular music standard written by Ray Winkler and John Hathcock (1919-2000) and recorded by many artists, most notably Jim Reeves.  Though the song is credited to Winkler and Hathcock, the melody was likely written by Eddie McDuff rather than Winkler.  A traditional love song, the bridge includes lyrics taken from Matthew 7:7â€“8 ("Knock and the door will open; seek and you will find; ask and you'll be given ... ," from the Sermon on the Mount).


== Jim Reeves version ==
The most famous version was performed by country music singer Jim Reeves, whose version was included on his 1962 album A Touch of Velvet.  Reeves' version, styled in the then-prevalent Nashville Sound-style, was released as a single in the U.S. in early 1964, and reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart that spring, and also gained sporadic airplay on pop radio stations, reaching the No. 2 spot on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The song would become one of Reeves' last major hits in the U.S. during his lifetime, as he was killed in a plane crash on July 31, 1964.
Reeves' version of "Welcome to My World" had been a hit single in the United Kingdom prior to its release as a single in the U.S., peaking at No. 6 in July 1963, and reaching No. 60 on the list of the top 100 best-selling singles of 1963 in the UK.

== Early life and education ==
Brown was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of United States Representative Clarence J. Brown. He attended Western High School in Washington, D.C. and graduated from Duke University in 1947 and Harvard Business School, with an M.A., in 1949.

Brown served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946 (V-12 Navy College Training Program) and again from 1950 to 1953 in the Korean War. Before entering the service, Brown had started working in the newspaper business for his father's family-owned Brown Publishing Company, from youth to 1953, and from 1957 to 2010. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Brown and his family lived in Urbana, Ohio, 90 miles north of Cincinnati, where the headquarters of the publishing company was based.
Brown served as president from 1965–1976, and later as chairman of the board. The company had interests in a wide network of newspapers across the country but, due to the rapidly changing business as a result of technology, it ceased operations in 2010 after 90 years.

Road Apples (album)

Road Apples is the second studio album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip, and it was their first to reach No. 1 in Canada.  The album has been certified Diamond in Canada.  It contains twelve tracks including “Cordelia”, "Three Pistols", “Little Bones,” and “Twist My Arm." During the Hip's last tour, in 2016, songs from this album were played live on a regular basis, featuring the above mentioned songs as well as ”Long Time Running”, “Last of the Unplucked Gems”, “The Luxury”, and “Fiddler's Green.” References to many prominent figures were used, including Tom Thomson and Jacques Cousteau, as well as political situations in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The track “Fiddler's Green" was written for Gord Downie’s young nephew, who died during the writing of the album. Because of the personal nature of the song, the Hip did not play it live often, but they played it on a regular basis during their final tour. The album's original working title was Saskadelphia, but this was rejected by the record label as likely to confuse listeners.

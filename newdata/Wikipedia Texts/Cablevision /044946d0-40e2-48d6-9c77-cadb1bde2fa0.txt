== Government Grants ==
Troy Cablevision, Inc. was awarded $26.1 million in federal stimulus funds in August 2010 to build a middle-mile fiber optical broadband network connecting Pike, Coffee, Crenshaw and Dale counties to Internet POP points in Montgomery and Dothan. The Southeast Alabama SmartBand initiative calls for 595 miles of fiber. The service provider already belongs to a public/private partnership with the South Alabama Electrical Cooperative for an effort to enable smartgrid energy management services for the coop's 17,000 electric customers in Pike, Coffee and Crenshaw counties. That initiative will include two backhaul routes to Atlanta, which could boost connectivity and attract economic development to the area.

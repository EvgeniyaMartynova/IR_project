This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
Hemavati's notes when shifted using Graha bhedam, yields 3 other major melakarta rāgams, namely, Keeravani, Vakulabharanam and Kosalam. Graha bhedam is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the shadjam to the next note in the rāgam. For further details and an illustration refer Graha bhedam on Keeravani.

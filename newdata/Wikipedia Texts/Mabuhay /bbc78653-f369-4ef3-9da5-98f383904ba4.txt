Mabuhay Singers

The Mabuhay Singers were a group of singers from the Philippines that was formed in 1958. Some of the members went on to become soloists like Cely Bautista, Raye Lucero, Naning Alba, and the late Rene Evangelista, among many others.
They were formed by the Villar Recording Company as a merged group from two vocal trios, namely the Tres Rosas, composed of Carmen Camacho, Nora Hermosa, and Raye Lucero; and the Lovers Trio, composed of Chi Lucerio, Floro San Juan, and Ador Torres. Filipino singers like Ruben Tagalog, Cely Bautista, Ric Manrique Jr., Rita Rivera, Don David, Flor Ocampo, Noel Samonte, Betty Rivera, Phil Llamas, Robert Malaga, and Everlita Rivera joined the group for a time. The Mabuhay Singers recorded more than 100 albums; some were released internationally. The albums contained traditional and modern Filipino music in major languages of the Philippines, and some songs in English and Spanish. In 1973, the Philippine Records Association awarded a citation for the group for their best-selling albums.

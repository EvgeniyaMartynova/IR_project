The Mabuhay Channel

The Mabuhay Channel was a Filipino language channel that broadcasts to Filipinos abroad. It was created exclusively for Filipinos living in the United States by Philippine Multimedia Systems, Inc. (PMSI), the only DTH satellite broadcaster in the Philippines, operator of now-defunct Dream Satellite TV and by-then sister company of the Associated Broadcasting Company. The Mabuhay Channel featured a wide array of programming from movies, music, sports, entertainment, current affairs to children's and lifestyle programming. The network was a unique partnership of five different Filipino broadcasters, bring together, ABC Channel 5, NBN Channel 4, RPN Channel 9, IBC Channel 13, E! Philippines Channel 31, CCI Asia Group (ISLA, Juice Channel and Living Asia Channel), and Viva Entertainment.
The Mabuhay Channel was available on digital cable in Canada and Dream Satellite TV in the Philippines. It was previously available in the US via the Dish Network but was no longer offered. As a result of this, the channel ceased broadcasting on August 18, 2008.

Université de Moncton

The Université de Moncton (abbr. U de M, transl. University of Moncton) is a French-language university located in Edmundston, Moncton and Shippagan, New Brunswick, Canada serving the Acadian community of Atlantic Canada. It is the only francophone university in New Brunswick and is one of only two such universities in the Maritimes, the other being the Université Sainte-Anne in Pointe-de-l'Église, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is also the largest French-language university in Canada outside Quebec.

Founded on 19 June 1963, the modern Université de Moncton is the result of the merger of three colleges: Collège Saint-Joseph (Memramcook, 1864), Collège du Sacré-Cœur (Caraquet, 1899 then Bathurst, 1915), and Collège Saint-Louis (Edmundston, 1946). In 1989, the Université of Moncton founded undergraduate degrees in adult education. Alan Beddoe designed the university coats of arms.The National Film Board of Canada documentary Acadia Acadia ?!? (1971), co-directed by Michel Brault and Pierre Perrault, documents how student protests at the university in 1968–69 sparked an awakening of Acadian nationalism.

=== Faculty of Law ===
The University of Moncton's Faculty of Law is one of only two French-language common law schools in the world. (The University of Ottawa also offers a common law education in French.) The school was founded in 1978 in order to respond to the needs of francophone communities outside Quebec. As Quebec practices civil law, there was a need to instruct francophone lawyers in common law to practice in other parts of Canada. The University of Ottawa law school teaches both common and civil law, as does McGill; thus the University of Moncton's Faculty of Law is the only exclusively French, exclusively common law school in Canada.U de M offers both the JD and the graduate LLM. The school also offers joint degrees: the JD-MBA (Masters of Business) and JD-MEE (Masters of Environmental Studies). As well, students who already possess a civil law degree (an LL.L or a BCL) from a Canadian school can enroll at U de M for two semesters to complete an LLB.


=== Medical Training Centre ===
The University of Moncton's Medical Training Centre is the first francophone school of medicine in  Atlantic Canada. It is a joint medical programme, offered by the Université de Sherbrooke which administers it. It is not technically a faculty of the University of Moncton.

The School of Food Science, Nutrition and Family Studies within the Faculty of Health Sciences and Community Services has an accredited dietetic program. The program is accredited by the Partnership for Dietetic Education and Practice, the accrediting body in Canada, and the program's graduates may subsequently become registered dietitians.

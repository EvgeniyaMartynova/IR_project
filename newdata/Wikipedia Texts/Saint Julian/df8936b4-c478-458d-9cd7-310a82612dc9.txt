Julian of Antioch

Julian (Latin: Julianus; d. AD 305 x 311), variously distinguished as Julian the Martyr, Julian of Antioch, Julian of Tarsus, Julian of Cilicia, and Julian of Anazarbus, was a 4th-century Christian martyr and saint. He is sometimes confused with the St Julian who was martyred with his wife Basilissa.


== Life ==
Of senatorial rank, he was killed during the persecutions of Diocletian. His legend states that he was subjected to terrible tortures and paraded daily for a whole year through various cities of Cilicia. He was then sewn up in a sack half-filled with scorpions, sand, and vipers, and cast into the sea. The sea carried his body to Alexandria, and he was buried there before being moved to Antioch.
Saint John Chrysostom preached a homily in Julian's honor at Antioch, whose chief basilica was said to be the final resting place for Julian's relics and was known in his honor.
His feast day is June 21 in the Eastern Orthodox Church, March 16 in the Roman Catholic Church.

== Early life in Britain ==
Roy Masters was born Reuben Obermeister in London in 1928 to a Jewish family of diamond cutters. Like his father, Boris, Masters uses the common anglicisation of his original surname.
Masters' father died in 1943, when Masters was 15 years old. His family could only afford education for his older brother, so Masters did not attend college. He was sent to Brighton, England to apprentice in diamond cutting at his uncle's company, Monnickendam Ltd.


== Career ==


=== Diamond cutting ===
Masters served in the Royal Sussex Regiment of the British Army during World War II. Following the war, he apprenticed in diamond cutting. He pursued his trade in many places, including Amsterdam; Brussels; Belgium; and Johannesburg in 1947, where he spent two years.In 1949, Masters emigrated to the United States. In his early twenties, he traveled across America, lecturing on the topic of diamond cutting in 40 different states. He was invited to participate in radio and TV interviews on the subject, and briefly hosted a daily radio show called Story of Your Diamond.Masters met and married his wife, Ann, in Birmingham, Alabama, and they eventually moved to Houston, Texas. He developed an interest in hypnosis, and sold his diamond cutting business to start a new company, the Institute of Hypnosis.


=== Lessons in hypnotism ===
During his early years in Brighton, Masters saw a stage hypnosis presentation where the hypnotist easily induced volunteer subjects to do strange and outlandish things. Masters remembered pondering the question: "Why can't hypnotism be used to make people act sensibly, rather than foolishly?"Upon further exploration of hypnotism in the 1950s, Masters repudiated hypnotherapy, but he soon opened the Institute of Hypnosis in Houston. There, he saw as many as thirty clients a day for consultation, where he says he "unhypnotised" them instead of hypnotizing them.Masters called hypnosis a "duplication of life's errors":

When I was a hypnotist, they used to say to me, "You're a hypnotist, are you? When are you going to put me to sleep?" And I would say, "Well when are you going to wake up? Because you're already asleep." Hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness [...] When a person is hypnotized—or reacts to stress, which is the same thing—he's not aware that he's being influenced. And when he is under the influence, he moves and has his being according to somebody else's will. And we don't realize that but when we do realize it, we make excuses. We deny. We deny that somebody else is controlling us other than us. That's our problem.

About his changing professions from diamond cutting, Masters said in an interview, "I had my own business, but I left that lucrative work because I had a calling for this kind of work. I'm more interested in what I'm doing now than anything else."Masters set the precedent for the legality of non-medical practice of hypnosis when he was charged with practising medicine without a license at age 30. He was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail.


=== The Foundation for Human Understanding ===
Masters bought a house trailer in 1961 and relocated his family to Grant’s Pass, where he founded a Oregon-based non-profit, the Foundation of Human Understanding. He produced a mindfulness meditation exercise recording titled How Your Mind Can Keep You Well, which became the title of his radio show and one of his books.


=== Talk radio show ===
In 1961, Masters started a talk radio counseling show, which is currently broadcast under the name Advice Line, as a syndicated program. He hosts the show, which has been on the air continuously since its start.


== Media appearances ==
Masters has appeared on CNN's Crossfire, Larry King Live, The Sally Jessy Raphael Show, The Sean Hannity Show, and The Drudge Report.

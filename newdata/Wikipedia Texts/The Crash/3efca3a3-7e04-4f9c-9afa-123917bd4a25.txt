Agron said that her character is "much more aggressive" than her past roles. On August 11, 2015, Rappaport and producer Atit Shah reported that the score, composed by Guy Moon, was being recorded by The Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra.Ashton Kutcher was first offered the role of Guy Clifton and accepted the role pending he could shoot on weekends while filming "Two and a Half Men" but scheduling conflicts forced him to drop out. Lenny Kravitz accepted the role of Guy Clifton but was forced to drop out of the project because of The Hunger Games promotions. With Lenny Kravitz attached, Zoey Kravitz was going to play his daughter, but after he departed from the project negotiations with Zoey fell through.

At the 2016 People's Choice Awards held in Los Angeles on January 6, 2016 Ed Westwick had this to say on how his fans will react to finally seeing him play a character with a solid sense of right and wrong, "It was different from anything I had done, that's always something that's going to make you attracted to a part," said Westwick. "The moral compass was also something that was interesting as well because after someone does something that's bad, how do they get back to a neutral place or a more positive place?" Westwick added that he's hoping fans enjoy seeing him in a new light.

Centrair C101 Pegase

The Centrair C101 Pegase is a Standard Class single-seat glider manufactured by Centrair starting in 1981. The design uses the ASW 19 fuselage with a new wing designed by ONERA, giving better performance than the German original.
Models manufactured since 1990 as the Pegase 90 are equipped with a different cockpit interior: Shorter handles, smaller instrument panel and minor structural changes. The major difference between the Pegase 90 and previous models was the introduction of flight controls that automatically connect during rigging.
The aircraft structure is composed of laminated fibreglass and epoxy resin. The wing has a laminar flow airfoil with top surface air brakes.

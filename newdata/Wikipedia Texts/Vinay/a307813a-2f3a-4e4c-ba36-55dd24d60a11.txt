== Playing style ==
Cricketing website ESPNcricinfo compares Vinay Kumar's style of bowling to that of Venkatesh Prasad, saying that he relies "more on outswingers, legcutters and accuracy, than on outright pace". His lack of pace in his Test debut against Australia in January 2012—bowling at 120 kilometres per hour in his opening spell—was criticised by former Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram as "disappointing". On the other hand, The Indian Express noted about Vinay Kumar's performances in his breakthrough 2010 IPL season: "He doesn’t bowl too fast nor too slow, and he doesn’t have threatening in-swingers or the deliveries that shape away from right-handers. But if there is one art that Vinay Kumar has mastered, it is the all-important one of picking up wickets." In the IPL 2018, Vinay got heavily trolled in social media after he told the trollers to "Chill"

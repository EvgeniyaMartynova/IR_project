== In other countries ==
Space Sheriff Gavan was released in the Philippines which aired on ABS-CBN in 1988-1991 & on ABC-5 (now TV5) as Sky Ranger Gavin in 1994-1997. Sky Ranger Gavin was then later aired in 1997-1998 on RPN-9 (now CNN-Philippines) before Choujin Sentai Jetman's airtime and was the 2nd Metal Hero showed in that station during 1999-2000. The re-run was then aired again on ABC-5 (now TV5). Every weeknights, Space Sheriff Shaider who's successor to Gavin, was aired in that country prior to the release of Sky Ranger Gavin.
The series was aired in France under the title X-OR. Its popularity led to airings of subsequent Metal Hero shows such as Space Sheriff Sharivan and Jikuu Senshi Spielban.
Indonesia and Malaysia's screening of Gavan (translated as Gaban) on local TV has gained itself a cult following, and the word Gaban itself has become a meme. It is used after adjectives to give an image of bravery e.g. "sebesar Gaban" ("as big as Gaban", epically big) or "Gaban betul" ("truly Gaban", really brave) or "tahap Gaban" stand for superior level of achievement.
In Brazil the series was very popular in the 1980s and 1990s, along with several seasons of Metal Hero franchise.

Kamranieh (also spelled Kamraniyeh) (Persian: كامرانيه‎) is an affluent and luxury neighbourhood located in one the northernmost parts of Greater Tehran in the area called Shemiran, on the slopes of Alborz mountain range. Kamranieh is known for its luxurious high-rise buildings, costly apartments and massive mansions.

Along with Farmanieh, Niavaran, Zafaraniyeh and Elahieh, it is now home to the most expensive real estate in Tehran. It is also the home to many Iranian nobles and notables as well as embassies and foreign officials.
The name  of Kamranieh is based on the son of Naser-al-din Shah, Kamran Mirza Nayeb es-Saltaneh, who used to own much of the land in the area. Kamranieh was one of the first neighbourhoods in Tehran that was equipped with a telephone system.
In addition, the first pet hospital of Iran, Tehran Pet hospital, was established in this neighbourhood in 2004.


== History ==

In the late 1800s, Kamran Mirza Nayeb es-Saltaneh, the eldest son of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, grabbed the lands of Kamranieh from the locals who used to farm in the area. Afterwards, he ordered to build a fabulous garden instead of the farmlands and then named it Kamranieh which means the estate belongs to Kamran. Kamranieh garden featured a large variety of plants and a greenhouse to protect sensitive flowers inside it in winter. In audition, two Austrian gardeners were hired to protect the garden all the time.
After Kamran Mirza's death in 1929, his children gradually sold the lands of Kamranieh garden to wealthy residents of Tehran. The new owners built themselves villas in order to use them as summer houses. Today however most of the gardens have been replaced by residential towers and newbuild apartments, few of them have actually escaped development.

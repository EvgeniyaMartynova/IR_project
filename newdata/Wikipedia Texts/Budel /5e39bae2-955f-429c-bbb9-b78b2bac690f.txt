Kempen Airport

Kempen Airport or Budel Airport (Dutch: Vliegveld Kempen), also just called Budel after the nearby town, is a general aviation airport in the south-east of the Netherlands located 5 NM (9.3 km; 5.8 mi) west of Weert and near the border with Belgium. Its main runway, 03/21, is a 1,199 m (3,934 ft) long asphalt runway. There is a second runway for microlight aircraft only, located next to the main runway, and is 600 m (1,969 ft) long.
The airport opened in 1970, initially only with a grass runway. An asphalt runway was created in 1991 of 930 m (3,051 ft), which was expanded later to its current length. Approach and runway lighting followed, making the airport suitable for IFR flights. With around 80,000 movements (a movement being a takeoff or landing) a year, it is amongst the largest general aviation airports in the Netherlands. International flights are allowed to and from the airport and it is used extensively by business aircraft, accounting for 80% of all aircraft movements.

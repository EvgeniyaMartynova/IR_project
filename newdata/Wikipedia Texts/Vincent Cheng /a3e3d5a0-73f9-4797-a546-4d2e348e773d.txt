In 1987, Cheng was one of the 22 Singaporeans branded as a "Marxist conspirator" and arrested under Operation Spectrum. He was the last detainee to be released.
On 1 January 1994, Amnesty International recognised him as a "prisoner of conscience."Cheng and his fellow detainees related some of their experiences, including physical torture, in the book, That We May Dream Again, published in 2009.
Cheng has also recounted on his experiences in the blog Singaporerebel. The NGO Singaporeans For Democracy (SFD) wrote an official letter of inquiry to the Internal Security Department over the issue.

Univision Deportes Radio

TUDN Radio (formerly Univision Deportes Radio) is a Spanish-language sports radio network in the United States under the TUDN division owned by Univision Communications, and is a companion to the TUDN TV channel. It launched on March 15, 2017 on ten AM and FM radio stations, most of which previously affiliated with the ill-fated Univision America until its 2015 closure. The network features stations in the states of Arizona, California, Texas, Illinois, Nevada, New York and Florida, covering half of the country's Hispanic population.
While its main focus is on soccer (much like its TV counterparts Univision, UniMás, TUDN TV channel, and digital brands), Univision Deportes Radio competed against ESPN Deportes Radio, owned by ESPN Inc., until 2019 which had 40 stations in 14 states.On May 7, 2019, Univision has announced that they'll form a partnership with Grupo Televisa and rename Univision Deportes to TUDN. The new branding is a combination of abbreviations TDN and UDN, but the first two letters are also pronounced as the Spanish adjective "tu" (your), allowing the name to also be read as "Tu deportes network" ("Your sports network"). Grupo Televisa also expanded the TUDN branding to Mexico. The rebranding took place on July 20 with a new slate of content built around live programming. The radio network was also renamed TUDN Radio in line with the TUDN rebrand. Following the demise of ESPN Deportes Radio on September 8, 2019, TUDN Radio added new radio affiliates in markets not served by this network.

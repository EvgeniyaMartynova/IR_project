== History ==
Kamonomiya Station was established as Sakawagawa signal box (酒匂川信号所, Sakawagawa shingōsho) on October 21, 1920, on the Atami Line of the Japan National Railways. It was upgraded to a full station on June 1, 1923 as a station for both freight and passenger service. With the opening of the Tanna Tunnel, the Atami Line became the Tōkaidō Main Line from December 1, 1934. Regularly scheduled freight services were discontinued in 1970, and parcel services by 1972. The current station building was completed in 1976. With the completion of Quadruple tracks between Odawara and Ofuna, freight services were resumed as of March 31, 1987. With the dissolution and privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company and the Japan Freight Railway Company. Automated turnstiles using the Suica IC Card system came into operation from November 18, 2001.

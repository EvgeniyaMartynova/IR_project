Agent Orange (band)

Agent Orange is an American punk rock band formed in Placentia, California in 1979.  The band was one of the first to mix punk rock with surf music.


== History ==
The power trio's original lineup was Mike Palm on guitar and vocals, Steve Soto on bass, and Scott Miller on drums.They first gained attention for their song "Bloodstains," originally appearing on their self-released debut 7" EP in 1980. A demo version of the song was given to Rodney Bingenheimer, a DJ at Pasadena radio station KROQ-FM, who placed it on his seminal 1980 compilation album, Rodney on the ROQ, on Posh Boy Records.
With James Levesque on bass (replacing Soto, who left to form the Adolescents), the group recorded their debut Living In Darkness album with Brian Elliot, best known for composing Madonna’s hit "Papa Don’t Preach." The record was released by Posh Boy in November 1981 and included another, newer version of "Bloodstains" (later used in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4). A 12" EP, Bitchin' Summer, followed in 1982 on Posh Boy.
Signing to Enigma Records, the band released another 12" EP, 1983's When You Least Expect It..., followed by a second album, This Is the Voice, released in 1986.In 1988, former Social Distortion bassist Brent Liles replaced Levesque, and the following year, Derek O'Brien (also a former member of Social Distortion as well as D.I.) replaced Miller on drums. In 1991, Restless Records released the Real Live Sound live album, recorded at The Roxy in Hollywood on July 21, 1990. It was the only Agent Orange recording to feature the Palm/Liles/O'Brien lineup.
Sam Bolle replaced Liles in January 1992, remaining with the band until May 2003, when he left to join Dick Dale's band.
A third studio album, Virtually Indestructible, was released in 1996 on the Gunka Disc label. The album featured drummer Charlie Quintana, formerly of the Plugz and later of Social Distortion.
Greatest & Latest – This, That-N-The Other Thing a compilation of rerecorded older material and new songs, was released in 2000 on Cleopatra Records, and featured Bolle on bass and Steve Latanation on drums. Latanation as well as Dusty Watson alternately played drums through 2008. In 2006, Perry Giordano joined on bass. In 2009, the band added drummer Dave Klein, who had previously recorded with numerous bands including the Bomboras, Ghastly Ones and the Seeds/Sky Saxon.
Former bassist Liles died on January 18, 2007, and former bassist Levesque died on October 19, 2014. Founding member and former bassist Steve Soto died on June 27, 2018.

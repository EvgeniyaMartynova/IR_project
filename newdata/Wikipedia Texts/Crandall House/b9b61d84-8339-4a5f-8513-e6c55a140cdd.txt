Lorenzo Crandall House

The Lorenzo Crandall House is an historic house at 221 High Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  It is a ​2 1⁄2-story wood-frame structure, built in 1848–49 for (and probably by) Lorenzo Crandall, a carpenter.  It features modest Greek Revival styling, including corner pilasters, a wide banded cornice, and molded window caps.  It is a well-preserved example of a type of housing that was once quite common in Pawtucket, but is no longer.The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

The Burning Fiery Furnace

The Burning Fiery Furnace is an English music drama with music composed by Benjamin Britten, his Opus 77, to a libretto by William Plomer.  One of Britten's three Parables for Church Performances, this work received its premiere at the St Bartholomew's Church, Orford, Suffolk, England, on 9 June 1966 by the English Opera Group.Colin Graham was the stage director of this first production.  Set designs were by Annena Stubbs.  The United States premiere was presented at the Caramoor Summer Music Festival on 25 June 1967 with Andrea Velis as Nebuchadnezzar.The scale and manner of instrumentation are similar to those in Curlew River, but one notable difference is the use of the alto trombone.Clifford Hindley has commented on a reading of a subtext sympathetic to homosexuality on the part of both Britten and Plomer in their treatment of the story.

== Synopsis ==
The Burning Fiery Furnace tells the story of Nebuchadnezzar  (the historical Nebuchadnezzar II) and the three Israelites, Ananias, Misael and Asarias (corresponding Babylonian names: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego), who were thrown into a furnace for their refusal to worship Nebuchadnezzar's image of gold.  However, God saves them from death, as the voice of an angel joins the Israelites in a 'Benedicite'.

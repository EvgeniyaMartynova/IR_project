Turnip (terminology)

Turnip can refer to three vegetables, which are described under the articles Turnip, Rutabaga, and Jicama.  The confusion results from the following regional differences of usage.

Brassica napus and B. napobrassica are called swedes (a shortening of Swedish turnip) in England, especially in the South, and in most dialects of the Commonwealth. Rutabaga, from the Swedish rotabagga, for "root bag" is mostly used in North America, in the United States and Canada. The rutabaga or swede differs from the turnip (Brassica rapa) in that it is typically larger and yellow-orange rather than white.However, in some dialects of British English the two vegetables have overlapping or reversed names. In the north of England and Scotland, the larger, yellow rutabagas are called neeps or swede from folk etymology, while the smaller white turnips are called turnips. In the North East of England where Geordies & Mackem's quite correctly refer to the larger purple vegetable with the yellow flesh as a turnip, and the small white root as a swede. The yellow fleshed swedes are known as "narkies" in Sunderland, and in past years used to be hollowed out and used as lanterns at Halloween.

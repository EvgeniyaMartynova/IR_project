One of the strongholds of Gaelic football in County Donegal, they have won the 2nd most Donegal Senior Football Championship behind Gaoth Dobhair who have won 15. Considered Donegal's most prolific club, they are renowned for their conveyor belt-like consistency in producing players of senior inter-county quality, including numerous All-Ireland winners. Also renowned for their success at minor level,they have won 19 minor football championships, with 3 minor championship wins and four final appearances in the four years from 2015 to 2018  they have toured abroad, particularly the United States in 1969 and 1998, and Glasgow in 1977. In 1980 they received an All-Ireland Club of the Year Award at a ceremony in Ballsbridge, Dublin.They have a long-running boundary dispute with neighbouring club Letterkenny Gaels, a side competing in the junior championship, who were founded in 1996. An agreement was signed between the two clubs that there would be no boundaries within the Town, however this has not stopped Letterkenny Gaels in the pursuit to divide the town along parish lines .


== History ==


=== Early days ===
Frank "Steve" Donohoe and Mickey McGovern formed a club called the "Fag a Bailes" in 1917 during a meeting at McGovern's Public House on Letterkenny's Lower Main Street. This club would be important to the proper establishment of Gaelic football in East Donegal. The town's first Gaelic football playing field was located where Scoil Colmcille, Letterkenny currently is. Also in the team of that era were goalkeeper Johnny McClean and Fr John McMonagle of Glencar, who played at midfield. Letterkenny's next clubs were the Geraldines (established in 1924) and Letterkenny Rovers. Letterkenny Rovers won the town's first Donegal Senior Football Championship in 1927—beating Carrigans in a final uniquely held at Newtowncunningham—with a field selected, goalposts erected and admission fee of 6d.


=== 1930 – 1947 ===
1930 brought the foundation of the current club, with Geraldines and Rovers fading away. Glencar was the location of the club's first playing pitch. In its first year of existence the club reached the final of the 1930 Donegal Senior Football Championship, losing to Dungloe by a scoreline of 3–2 to 2–3. The club purchased the grounds for O'Donnell Park for £300 in the 1930s. The ground opened on Sunday 2 May 1937, when a hurling match between Donegal and Antrim and a football match between Donegal and Armagh were divided by an address from GAA President R. O'Keeffe, and all were preceded by the Most Rev. Dr. McNeely, Bishop of Raphoe's Blessing of the Park. By the mid-1940s, it was Letterkenny's only GAA club—having also seen off both St. Pat's and St. Columba's—and the team reached the final of the Donegal Senior Football Championship in 1944, 1946 and 1947, losing to the four-in-a-row invincibles from Gaoth Dobhair.


=== 1948 – 1969 ===
The club won their first Donegal Senior Football Championship in 1948, defeating old nemesis and previously invincible Gaoth Dobhair by a scoreline of 1–7 to 2–1. The club made the final again in 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1952, eventually winning their second title in 1956, beating Ballyshannon by a scoreline of 0–8 to 1–2. In 1960 the club beat Gaoth Dobhair in the final again, this time by a scoreline of 0–11 to 0–3. In 1967 the club beat St. Joseph's by a scoreline of 1–13 to 1–9, and beat the same team again in 1969, by a scoreline of 0–10 to 1–4 on that occasion.


=== 1970s – 1990s ===
In 1972 the club beat Clan na nGael—a previous incarnation of Four Masters—by a scoreline of 2–12 to 1–8 in the final at MacCumhaill Park in Ballybofey.There followed a lull, broken in 1983, when the club defeated Ard an Rátha in the final by a scoreline of 0–08 to 0–03. There would be no further senior titles until 1999. The club was accused of fielding an ineligble player against Aodh Ruadh in the 1997 senior final which was won on the pitch but taken away in the boardroom in controversial circumstances , and were subsequently disqualified from the Competition. The player in question had played championship football in America earlier in the year and despite St Eunan's being given the all-clear to field him the County title was subsequently stripped. The club roared back against Aodh Ruadh in the 1999 final, with Brendan Devenney broke Martin McHugh's record by scoring 0–14 of his team's 1–19 to their opponents' 1–11.


=== 21st-century ===
In the 2001 championship final the club defeated Four Masters by a scoreline of 1–10 to 0–08. In the 2006 final Gaoth Dobhair beat them by 1–06 to 0–04
In 2007 they beat local rivals Glenswilly by a scoreline of 0–12 to 1–03. In 2008 they beat Termon, their neighbours on the other side of town, by a scoreline of 2–13 to 1–08 and went on to win a match in the Ulster Senior Club Football Championship for the first time, defeating Clonoe O'Rahilly's of Tyrone, the county that had just won that year's All-Ireland title, in the quarter-final. However, Crossmaglen Rangers knocked them out in the semi-final. In 2009 the club achieved the three-in-a-row, defeating Naomh Conaill by a scoreline of 0–13 to 0–06. They would beat the same team in the 2012 final. 2011 brought minor football and hurling titles; in the football, they defeated Ardara 3–7 to 0–3, with Sean McBride, Lee McMonagle and Callum Keaveney getting the goals, while, in the hurling, they made history in July by winning their first ever minor hurling title, defeating Burt in a great contest highlighted by a stunning goal from Kevin Meehan. In 2013, a player was rushed to hospital with serious injuries sustained during a game against Naomh Conaill. They beat Glenswilly again in the 2014 final.


==== 2012 season ====
Eunan's were crowned Donegal Senior Football Champions in 2012. The decisive goal in the final was scored by young Lee McMonagle in the 50th minute of the game, following a layoff from full-forward Ross Wherity, who received the ball via a long pass from Rory Kavanagh. The teams were level on many occasions until Mark McGowan scored the winning point in freak circumstances. Brendan McDyre of opponents Naomh Conaill attempted to backpass to his goalkeeper Stephen McGrath only for the ball to drift out for a '45'. McGowan stepped up to punish. As the game ended he was photographed celebrating—stooped, wild-eyed with open mouth, sweat-soaked, bare thighs tensed, veins throbbing, mud-stained legs apart and clenched fists turned upwards.

== Turkey Mountain ==
Turkey Mountain is a hill occupying a wide area on the west side of the Arkansas River in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The summit is 104 feet (32 m) above the river below, offering a good view of Tulsa.


== Trails ==
The Turkey Mountain Urban Wilderness Area have four marked trails between 0.8 and 5.7 miles (1 and 9 km) in length, for running or cycling as well as over 25 miles (40 km) of unmarked trails. The 25 mile long River Parks paved trail passes through the Turkey Mountain Wilderness Area, close to the river, connecting the area to other river side parks in Tulsa.In June 2016, the National Park Service designated the Turkey Mountain trails as part of the National Recreation Trail system.


== Claimed petroglyphs ==
Close to the river there are several markings in the stone, one of which has been claimed to be the letters "gwn" (claimed to mean fair or white hair). These were believed by writer Barry Fell to be petroglyphs left by pre-Columbian European travelers. The idea of Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact by Europeans, apart from the Vikings in Newfoundland, is considered a fringe theory or pseudoarchaeology.

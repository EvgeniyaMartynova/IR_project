== Music video ==


=== Background ===
The music video was released on March 7, 2019, and directed by Isaac Rentz. Max described the video's setting: “I actually filmed it in a school because of the bullying that goes on. It starts in school. That’s where a lot of people get hurt from it all. I wanted the storyline to focus on all the outcasts and all that diversity to show that we are all one in unity. It’s okay to be different. In general, I think society wants to put us in a format and I don’t think we should be fitting into it. We should do our own thing.” As of November 2019, the video has over 97 million views.


=== Synopsis ===

The video begins with Ava Max walking down a school corridor, wearing a black & red striped shirt, along with a black dress. As she opens a locker, she begins to sing the song's first chorus while she stares at the mirror. She turns to face the camera and begins to walk down the brightened hallway, as students begin to enter their designated classrooms. She performs a dance alongside two girls wearing Catholic school uniform, before breaking into the chorus in the playground with 6 other school students while wearing a white shirt. Various shots showing students of different ethnic backgrounds are used throughout the chorus.
The next shot occurs with Max sitting on top of the teacher's desk, as the word 'DETENTION' is written on the blackboard. The same students seen in the chorus look around at each other, as Max dances around them. During the second chorus and bridge, Max wears a black blazer on top of a red shirt, while dancing inside a football stadium with multiple students. She is seen wearing red Beats by Dre headphones while standing next to a wall. The final chorus shows Max walking onto the field with the students, as they socialize with each other while sitting down. Max performs a belt on the field, as the students are lined up next to each other, holding up their right hand under their mouth with the words 'SO AM I' written in black ink. The video ends with Max placing her right hand over her forehead at the end of the line, as she falls backwards.

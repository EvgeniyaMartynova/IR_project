Including some Christian and Jewish elements but superseding and replacing all previous Scriptures such as the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the original Jewish Talmud. Recounting the creation of the Sturch (State Church) by Isaac Sigmen, the Forerunner; the period of His Glorious Rule on Earth; the failed attempt of the Scarlet Woman to seduce Him; and the moment when He boarded His Time Machine and went on His Journey to the Future - promising that He would emerge on The Day of the Timestop, to wage the Final Struggle with his Evil Brother, the Backrunner.

The Ninth and Tenth Editions, used in 1984, were provisional and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later.
The Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary, the final, perfected version, came out later, long after Winston Smith was convicted of thoghtcrime and vaporised. Also Syme was convicted of thoughtcrime and vaporised; therefore, though the Eleventh Edition included many of Syme's contributions, he was given no credit for them. In Keep the Aspidistra Flying:

=== Works (possibly) invented by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite ===
Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite' was a Christian theologian and philosopher of the late 5th to early 6th century, whose real name is unknown and who pseudonymously identifies as Dionysius the Areopagite, the Athenian convert of Paul the Apostle mentioned in Acts 17:34. He left a considerable corpus of works. Seven other works are mentioned repeatedly by pseudo-Dionysius in his surviving works, and are presumed either to be lost or to be fictional works mentioned by the Areopagite as a literary device to give the impression to his sixth-century readers of engaging with the surviving fragments of a much larger first-century corpus of writings. These seven other works are:
Theological Outlines (Θεολογικαὶ ὑποτυπώσεις),
Symbolic Theology (Συμβολικὴ θεολογία),
On Angelic Properties and Orders (Περὶ ἀγγελικῶν ἰδιοτήτων καὶ τάξεων),
On the Just and Divine Judgement (Περὶ δικαίου καὶ θείου δικαστηρίου),
On the Soul (Περὶ ψυχῆς),
On Intelligible and Sensible Beings,

In Roma Eterna: 

The Book of Aaron, composition attributed to Aaron but probably written at some later time.
In this alternate history, The Book of Aaron provides the traumatic story of how the Israelite Exodus from Egypt failed: Moses and many of the Israelites drowned, and the remnant—led by Aaron—were fetched back to slavery in Egypt. Later on, however, the Hebrews were freed from bondage, and until the equivalent of the 20th Century remained a distinct religious-ethnic minority in Egypt, practicing a monotheistic religion, of which The Book of Aaron is a major Scripture.

 In The Iron Dream :

The Master Race by Adolf Hitler
The Thousand Year Rule by Adolf Hitler
The Triumph of the Will by Adolf Hitler
Lord of the Swastika by Adolf Hitler
The author, Adolf Hitler, served in the Imperial German Army in the Great War. After briefly dabbling in radical politics he emigrated to the United States in 1919 and became a Science Fiction illustrator. After gaining fluency in English he became also an editor and author - eventually becoming known as a major writer of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. He wrote Lord of the Swastika, his final science fantasy novel, in six weeks in 1953, shortly before dying of cerebral hemorrhage (possibly caused by tertiary syphilis). Lord of the Swastika subsequently won the Hugo Award and the "colorful uniforms" described therein become a regular feature of cosplayers at science fiction conventions. The novel was praised as a major work of Heroic fantasy and for its "haunting evocation of a Germany that never was".

Duval County, Texas

Duval County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2010 census, its population was 11,782. The county seat is San Diego. The county was founded in 1858 and later organized in 1876. It is named for Burr H. Duval, a soldier in the Texas Revolution who died in the Goliad Massacre.


== History ==
Even though Duval County lies in the United States, it has long been Mexican in character.  A Mexican first surveyed it in 1804, Jose Contrerras, surveyor general of San Luis Potosi.  Luis Muniz was born there in 1828, the county's first recorded birth.  The important colonists came from Mier, Tamaulipas - and Anglos later respected their descendants as the old Mexican families.
The Texas Legislature established Duval County February 1, 1858.  The Texas Almanac of 1867 reported that Duval and nearby Dimmit County had only four stock raisers and their population was unlikely to grow much absent the discovery of mineral wealth.  Not long after, a wave of Anglo immigrants entered the county to raise sheep.  Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Irishmen, and Scots came.  During this boom, the county seat enjoyed formal balls and haute cuisine.  The Hotel Martinet's Sunday feast drew patrons from Corpus Christi, 50 miles (80 km) to the East.  The death rate rivaled Tombstone, Arizona's. Some died under the code duello but more by foul play; the victims were usually Mexican.  A vigilante group from Duval and McMullen County found a great pile of cowhides (presumably from stolen animals) near the county line; they lynched 15 Mexicans there.  Prosperity in the 1880s eased ethnic animosities.  After the Texas-Mexican Railway was built in 1881, its San Diego station was important for hides, wool, and cotton.  But in 1886 the sheep began to die, and the boom died.The corrupt Parr family political machine dominated Duval and nearby Jim Wells counties during the twentieth century, and were instrumental in the 1948 election of Lyndon Johnson to the US Senate, and to some extent the 1960 presidential election which threw Texas to John F Kennedy.

== Politics ==
Like much of heavily Hispanic South Texas, Duval County is a Democratic stronghold. The last Republican to carry the county was Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. In the 1964, 1968 and 1972 presidential elections, Duval was the most Democratic county in the country. In the 2004 presidential election, it went solidly for Democrat John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, while George W. Bush carried the state as a whole by a wide margin. In the 2008 presidential election Barack Obama received 74.80 percent of the county's vote. In all the Democratic candidate consistently received more than seventy percent of the county’s vote between 1956 and 2012, although Hilary Clinton’s 2016 result was the weakest by a Democrat since at least Adlai Stevenson II.

After the initial election returns in the 1948 Democrat runoff primary election for U.S. Senate, Duval County added 425 votes for Lyndon B. Johnson over Coke R. Stevenson. (George Parr simultaneously arranged the more famous electoral fraud for Johnson in Alice, Texas.)Duval County is notorious for corrupt politics, particularly during the early and mid-20th century, when it was largely controlled by the political machine of Texas State Senator Archie Parr and his son George Parr, each in his turn called El Patrón or the "Duke of Duval". Givens Parr had been county judge before his younger brother George.  George was later elected sheriff. Archer Parr III, George's nephew and adopted brother, later held both those offices. Meanwhile, then Texas Attorney General John Ben Shepperd brought some three hundred state indictments against county and school officials.

April Showers (song)

"April Showers" is a popular song with music written by Louis Silvers and lyrics by B. G. De Sylva. First published in 1921, it is one of many popular songs whose lyrics use a "Bluebird of happiness" as a symbol of cheer. ("So keep on looking for a bluebird, and listening for his song.") In 2014, the song was later remastered by Pierre Karana, he is also attributed to remixing the lyrics.
The song was introduced in the 1921 Broadway musical Bombo, where it was performed by Al Jolson. It became a well-known Jolson standard: the first of his several recordings of the song was on Columbia Records in October 1921. It has also been recorded by many other artists.
Spike Jones and Doodles Weaver produced a parody that began with the lyrics: "When April showers, she never closes the curtain..."
The British comedians Morecambe and Wise performed a skit featuring the song, which involved a light sprinkling of water drizzling on straight man Ernie Wise whenever he sang it, but a bucket of water being thrown over Eric Morecambe whenever he did the same.

Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said, "Even with expert presentation, this would be an insufferable tale. As played by Jack Carson, Ann Sothern and a kid named Robert Ellis, it is death. Mr. Carson, who had some experience as a vaudevillian before he hit the screen, draws on his memories so fondly that he blithely rips the whole show apart. And Miss Sothern, who obviously knows it's useless to intrude, just stands around and clucks. But the youngster—well, in the manner of the true vaudevillian, we suppose, he tries to out-mugg Mr. Carson. He and vaudeville—and almost we—are killed in the act."

Beer for Wildlife gives back a portion of the profits to wildlife land acquisitions and preservation. The name Bank Brewing was derived from the building that now houses the taproom, an old bank that sits on Main street in Hendricks. In 2014, after an extensive renovation of the building, the brewery began operation in what was previously a historic creamery building.  The year also marked the introduction of the head brewer, Richard Drawdy. Richard brought a new spectrum of beer styles to the Bank Beer lineup including IPA, Black IPA and more approachable ones like Berliner Weisse and Pale Wheat.

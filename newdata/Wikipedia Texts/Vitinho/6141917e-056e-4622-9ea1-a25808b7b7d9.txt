== Club career ==

During the 2013 season, he scored 4 goals in 16 Série A games.


=== CSKA Moscow ===

On 2 September 2013, Vitinho signed a 5-year contract with Russian Premier League Champions CSKA Moscow. However, Vitinho struggled to be in the regular first team and instead, he made a handful appearances from the bench and often remained an unused substitute. Vitinho was linked with a loan move to Botafogo.


=== Internacional ===
On 16 January 2015 Vitinho joined Internacional on a one-year loan deal. The loan was extended until the end of 2016 on 24 December 2015. At the same time Vitinho extended his CSKA contract until the summer of 2020. CSKA had an option to recall him from loan in the summer of 2016, but they did not. At the end of his loan, CSKA announced they will not extend the loan and Vitinho will return to CSKA for the start of their camp in January 2017.


=== Flamengo ===
Following the 2018 Russian Super Cup game that CSKA won on 27 July 2018, the club announced that this was Vitinho's last game for them as they agreed on his transfer with Flamengo. Both clubs agreed in a €10 million transfer fee, so Vitinho became the highest transfer in Flamengo's history.

Bob Gale

Michael Robert Gale (born May 25, 1951) is an American screenwriter, producer and film director. He co-wrote the science fiction comedy film Back to the Future with writing partner Robert Zemeckis, and the screenplays for the film's two sequels. Gale also co-produced all three films and served as associate producer on the subsequent animated TV series. Michael J. Fox noted that Back to the Future co-creator Bob Gale is "the gatekeeper" for the franchise.


== Early life ==
Gale was born to a Jewish family in University City, Missouri, the son of Maxine, née Kippel, (died 2010), an art dealer and violinist, and Mark R. Gale (1922-2018), an attorney, World War II veteran, and later a University City councilman. He is the oldest of his two other brothers, Charlie, who wrote the screenplay for Ernest Scared Stupid, and Randy. Gale received a B.A. in Cinema in 1973 from the University of Southern California, where he wrote fanzine reviews for classmate Mike Glyer's fanzine, and met classmate Zemeckis.As a teen, he created his own comic book, The Green Vomit, using spirit duplication, and also co-founded a popular comic book club in St. Louis. Later, he and his brother Charlie made his own amateur three-film series parody of the Republic Pictures Commando Cody serials, using the character name "Commando Cus".The last two of these were made in collaboration with Richard Rosenberg. (Rosenberg had taken over the series with the third, 1973's Commando Cus vs. Kung Fu Killers, in which Gale made a cameo appearance as the title character without his face-covering helmet, and was working on a fourth at the time of his death.)

== Controversy ==
It has been established that Gale created a likeness of Crispin Glover's face and placed it on another actor during the production of Back to the Future Part II and Back to the Future Part III.  Crispin Glover, during an interview with Colider Live, had strong words about Gale and the unfair treatment.  It has also been established during a lawsuit that pitted Glover against Gale for infringement, that there was a finding of libel against Gale for those actions.

Built c. 1955, it is a classic example of a Quonset Hut, a form popularized during World War II for military uses.  It has corrugated metal walls and ceiling, and is set on a concrete foundation.  Its main facade, in one of the vertical ends, has a centrally-positioned garage door, with a sash window to the left, and a pedestrian entrance to the right.  The building was used as city hall until 1968, when the present hall was built.The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

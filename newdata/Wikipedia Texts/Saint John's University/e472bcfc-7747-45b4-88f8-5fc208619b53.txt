The Saint John's Affiliate School Programme was launched in 2007 with the aim of using Saint John's educational knowledge to improve private schools throughout the Kingdom of Thailand. The programme aims to have one school in each province of Thailand that have the support of Saint John's group of schools in Bangkok. While each school that joins the programme aims to improve educational standard across all subject areas, the two initial points of development focus are English instruction and IT support, as Saint John's group of schools are known to be leading schools in these two areas in the kingdom.  As of May 2008, three schools have been admitted to the affiliation programme:

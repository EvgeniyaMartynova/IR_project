The village was first mentioned in 1346 in a document of the Great Lavra monastery on Mount Athos. During the Turkish rule, all of its residents were Greek. It had 90 families in 1874, and a community school was opened in that year. After the column of Kaminia was discovered in 1885, the village was visited by many tourists.

=== Poliochne ===

The Bronze Age settlement Poliochne has been excavated near the beach of Vroskopos.


=== Vroskopos ===
Vroskopos (also Voroskopos) is a small settlement on the coast, 2 km southeast of Kaminia. It was named after the nearby promontory. A settlement at the site of Vroskopos is evidenced by tombs from the 11th to 13th century. It was first mentioned by Florentine traveler Buondelmonti in 1418. A fortress was built in the 13th century. In the 15th century the coastal areas, including Vroskopos, were abandoned, but in the late 16th and 17th centuries the port was used again. The castle and the village were probably destroyed around 1656 in the Fifth Ottoman-Venetian War. Moreover, pirate attacks forced the inhabitants to move to inland villages such as Kaminia. By the 20th century Vroskopos was settled again as the sea port of Kaminia. Tourist facilities were built, and in 2011 Vroskopos had 9 permanent inhabitants.

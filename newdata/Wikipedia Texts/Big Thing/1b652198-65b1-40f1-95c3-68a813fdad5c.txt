Big Thing (Blue Zone album)

Big Thing is the debut album by Lisa Stansfield's band, Blue Zone. It was released by Arista Records in June 1988. The songs were written by Blue Zone members: Stansfield, Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, and produced by Paul Staveley O'Duffy. The album also includes one cover, "Jackie," co-produced by Ric Wake. Big Thing spawned three singles: "On Fire," "Thinking About His Baby" and "Jackie." A remastered and expanded deluxe 2-CD set was released in the United Kingdom on 18 November 2016; it was the album's first release in the band's native country.


== Background ==
Blue Zone was formed in 1984 and consisted of Lisa Stansfield on vocals, and Ian Devaney and Andy Morris on instruments. In 1986, the trio released their first two singles: "Love Will Wait" and "Finest Thing." In 1987, they started working on their first album which was released in November 1988 but did not include "Love Will Wait" and "Finest Thing." The record company postponed the album many times and finally released it in Europe, North America and Australia in November 1988 and in Japan in early 1989. However, the album wasn't released in the United Kingdom until the 2016 deluxe edition.


== Content ==
The album includes eleven songs (ten on the US edition) written by Lisa Stansfield, Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, except for "Jackie" written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. "Jackie" was originally recorded by Elisa Fiorillo in 1987 for the Summer School soundtrack. The album was produced by Paul Staveley O'Duffy, except for "Perfect Crime" produced by Blue Zone. Ric Wake co-produced "Jackie" and "Perfect Crime." The US edition contains the full intro of "Perfect Crime," which was cut on other versions of the album.

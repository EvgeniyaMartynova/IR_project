Kamembe Airport

Kamembe International Airport is an airport for Cyangugu and Kamembe in Rwanda (IATA: KME, ICAO: HRZA). RwandAir operates a Dash 8-Q400 with seven flights per week to and from Kigali. The airport receives charter flights from Tanzania, Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, though not on a regular schedule. 
During the Rwandan Civil War, Kamembe airport was suggested as a site for transiting French arms to the interim government after April 1994.The airport terminal building was heavily damaged by a 2008 earthquake, and early in 2010 the Rwanda government announced that Kamembe Airport would be modernized. By the end of 2012 a new terminal was completed, a new control tower was opened, and  Techno Sky, a branch of the Italian publicly owned ENAV corporation, had installed new navigation systems.During a May 2013 visit, Infrastructure Minister Albert Nsengiyumva announced that the runway would be widened and lengthened from 1.5 kilometres to 2.2 kilometres by 2014-2015. The airport re-opened in June 2015 and RwandAir began scheduled flights from the airport.

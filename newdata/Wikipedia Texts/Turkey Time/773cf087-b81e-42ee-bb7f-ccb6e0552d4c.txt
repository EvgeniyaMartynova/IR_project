Time in Turkey

Time in Turkey is given by UTC+03:00 year-round. This time is also called Turkey Time (TRT) or Türkiye Saati İle (TSİ). The time is currently same as in the Arabia Standard Time, Further-eastern European Time and Moscow Time zone. Turkey Time was adopted by the Turkish government on September 8, 2016. It was also in use in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus until it reverted to EET in October 2017.


== History ==
Until 2016, Turkey was using Eastern European Time (EET) in the winter (UTC+02:00) and Eastern European Summer Time (EEST) (UTC+03:00) during the summer. The date for transition between standard time and daylight saving time generally followed EU rules, but had variations in some years. In 2016, the decision to stay on UTC+03:00 year-round was enacted. In October 2017, the Turkish government announced that starting October 28, 2018, the country would revert to EET, but this decision was reversed in November 2017. In October 2018, a Presidential decree announced that UTC+03:00 would remain the year-round permanent time zone for the country.

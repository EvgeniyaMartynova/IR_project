Sistema Nacional de Televisión (Nicaragua)

The National Television System (Sistema Nacional de Televisión - SNTV) was a television network in Nicaragua, owned and operated by the government from 1990 to 1997. 
With Violeta Chamorro's triumph in the 1990 elections, Canal 6 (then part of the Sandinista Television System) became the new National Television System. In 1997 it was legally declared in bankruptcy under Arnoldo Alemán's government.

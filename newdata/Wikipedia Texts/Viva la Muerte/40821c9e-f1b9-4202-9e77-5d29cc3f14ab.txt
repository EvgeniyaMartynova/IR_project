Viva la Muerte (Inkubus Sukkubus album)

Inkubus Sukkubus are a British goth and pagan band, formed in 1989 by Candia Ridley, Tony McKormack and Adam Henderson, who have been described as one of the most enduringly popular underground Goth bands in the UK. They also have been described by Mick Mercer as a "zombie version of Fleetwood Mac" in his book Hex Files: the goth bible.


== History ==
Inkubus Sukkubus have released albums and toured the UK and internationally ever since their formation as Incubus Succubus in 1989.
In 1995, they changed their name to Inkubus Sukkubus, citing numerological reasons, and signed to Resurrection Records. The live line-up changed significantly, adopting the use of a drum machine and sequenced backing, with some additional support by a bodhrán, and Adam Henderson moving back to bass.
In 1996, the band appeared live on UK national television on Channel 4's 'The Big Breakfast', performing the track 'Heartbeat Of The Earth'.The band have played many of the major European dark alternative festivals including Amphi, M'era Luna, and the Wave-Gotik-Treffen at Leipzig.
Inkubus Sukkubus were due to play a gig in Mexico City on Beltane (1 May) 2009. When it was cancelled due to the outbreak of swine flu, the band received national media exposure, particularly through The Sun newspaper.In June 2017 the band hosted a weekend event at St Briavels Castle in the Forest of Dean – a celebration of midsummer with storytelling, history, Egyptian dancing, and a handfasting ceremony. 


== Members ==
The group currently consists of guitarist Tony McKormack, vocalist Candia McKormack and bassist Roland Link. The band uses a drum machine and sequencer to provide percussion and orchestral backing. They also perform as a fully acoustic act with Abigail Blackman on cello, Nick Gibbs on violin, and Marcus Gilvear on drums.

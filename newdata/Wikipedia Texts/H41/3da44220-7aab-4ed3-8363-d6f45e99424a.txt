Hanriot H.41

The Hanriot H.41 was a military trainer aircraft produced in France in the 1920s. It was a further development in the family of aircraft that had commenced with the HD.14 in 1920, and incorporated a number of design features that had been developed for other members of that family. Like those other aircraft, however, it was a conventional, two-bay biplane with unstaggered wings of equal span.
The H.41 used the modern engine and mixed construction developed for the HD.40 air ambulance and used them in a new design for a military trainer. The design did not prove a success, however, and only eleven were built, with three different engine types. A floatplane variant based on the HD.17 was slightly more successful, with twelve examples exported to Greece and Portugal.

Fédération Internationale de l'Art Photographique

Fédération Internationale de l'Art Photographique, or FIAP (Eng. The International Federation of Photographic Art), is an international organization of national associations of photography. More than 85 national associations are members, comprising nearly one million individual photographers.
FIAP was founded by M. Van de Wijer of Belgium in 1946. The first members were the photographic associations from Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and Switzerland. In 1947, Denmark, Finland and Hungary joined. The first FIAP congress took place in Bern, Switzerland in 1950, at which time additional national association members included Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Spain, Finland, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Sweden, and Yugoslavia. FIAP Biennials are currently held every 2 years, in different countries, during odd numbered years for black and white and nature photography, and even numbered years for color photography.
The FIAP gives a rare honorary of Master of Photography (MFIAP). The third man to have received an MFIAP was Benu Sen from India.

== Music video ==
A music video was directed by Jake Davis. It was premiered on March 7, 2011. It features appearances by featured artist Dev in shiny glittering dress, which changes into a white-and-pink dress with a quarter of a pyramid and The Cataracs. The first few scenes were shot with a silver Mercedes-Benz 300SL, with appearance by all artists. The scene changes to a "party in a club" scene after the second chorus, and the back seats of a car, given the title of the song.  It ends with New Boyz being covered by the shadows. Ironically, the music video contains cars that actually don't feature back seats as well as a mustang in place of the Camaro that is not orange. Also in the video, car miniatures were used to create an illusion of it being full-scale models.

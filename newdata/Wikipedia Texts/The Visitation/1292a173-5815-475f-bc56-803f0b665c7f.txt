== Plot ==
In present-day Antioch, Washington former minister Travis Jordan still lives, after losing his faith in God three years before when his beloved wife was murdered and the criminals never found. Suddenly, miracles happen in the little town: the new veterinarian's son survives a van accident without a single scratch, Travis' dog Max revives after being buried, a paraplegic walks, a scarred teenager and her police officer father (who has a brain tumor) heal.
In all the events, either a group of three men wearing black are seen nearby, or only their tall, blond (possible) leader, who seems to want everyone to know that "he is coming". Very soon after this a scruffy, gentle-mannered newcomer arrives; Brandon Nichols. He implies through his healing work and preaching that he is Jesus Christ or a better version of the messiah. The local population soon worships Brandon, while Travis and Morgan feel that something is wrong and conduct an investigation, disclosing that evil has possessed the town dwellers.

Craven Park, Hull

Hull College Craven Park Stadium (formally known as KCOM Craven Park) and also referred to as New Craven Park is the home of the Hull Kingston Rovers R.F.C. It is situated on Preston Road in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England.


== History ==
Hull Kingston Rovers moved to the new ground in 1989 from the Old Craven Park which was sited on Holderness Road. The stadium was the former home to the Hull Vikings speedway team, but they left when the ground was refurbished for  
the Hull Kingston Rovers use in the Super League. The first match was played against Trafford Borough packing in a full capacity 8,500 crowd to watch. Rovers convincingly started the new era, and in that season were crowned Division Two champions.In 2006 the ground and pitch were substantially improved as the club sought a return to the top flight of English rugby league. Plans for the Hull Kingston Rovers to move from Craven Park to a new purpose-built rugby league stadium to be constructed at a new, unconfirmed site were suggested in 2007, but shortly after this, Hull City Council, in partnership with Kingston Community Developments Limited and the Hull Kingston Rovers, announced that terms for lease agreements had been reached to support the long-term future of Craven Park. These terms enabled investment and development of the stadium to move forward.
The initial phase of redeveloping Craven Park was the lease purchase of a temporary seated stand which replaced the use of the inadequate south terrace for visiting away fans. The Hull Kingston Rovers' second season in the Super League coincided with work beginning on the extension of the standing terraced East Stand. This extension increased the capacity of the stand by 1,120 bringing its overall capacity to 4,750. A similar extension to the opposite end of the stand was completed in 2009.
A new purpose built South Stand is likely to house away supporters. This would allow the new North Stand to be used by home fans. A new South Stand is likely to have a capacity of around 2,500 with facilities that will take the club forward. Designs are yet to be announced, but it is likely to be a terraced stand. An extension to the East Stand and a new purpose built South Stand will take the grounds capacity to 14,500, which would see Craven Park become the 5th largest ground in Super League.
On Good Friday 2018 a new Craven Park attendance record was set, beating the previous record of just under 12,000 against the Leeds Rhinos. 12,090 packed into the stadium to witness cross city rivals Hull FC beat the Robins.

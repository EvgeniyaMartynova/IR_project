Craven Park was built in 1931, largely as a result of the efforts of supporters of Barrow RLFC, 500 of whom volunteered to construct the ground. The total cost of the building project came to £7,500 which was an unbelievable figure in those days.
The stadium was named after Commander G. W. Craven, a local war hero, who had started the appeal fund with a donation of £500. It should not be confused with Craven Park, or Old Craven Park in Hull, other rugby league venues.
For the 2010 season the ground was known as the Furness Heating Components Stadium (Craven Park). For the visit of Wigan in the Challenge Cup improvements were made and the capacity is now 7,600 (up from 6,500).
Matches between either Barrow or Cumbria against touring international rugby league sides included:

Independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) greyhound racing took place around Craven Park from 1932-1933.

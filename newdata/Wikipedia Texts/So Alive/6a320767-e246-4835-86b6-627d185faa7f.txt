== Background ==
The song's radio edit lasts just under three minutes, while the album version has a longer intro and lasts nearly four minutes Skepta described the song to Digital Spy: "It's a fusion. N-Dubz are seen as a pop group and I'm more of an urban artist. Normally when those two collide the result is a big pop tune, but I wanted to do it the other way around and bring out N-Dubz's grime side. Fortunately fans of mine and N-Dubz both seem to love it!" He also explained the delay of the official single release: "I've been waiting for the right time to get it out. There was a bit of a rat race last year with so many grime artists coming out, but I feel like I've got a clear run at the moment and there's a buzz about it. Timing is everything."

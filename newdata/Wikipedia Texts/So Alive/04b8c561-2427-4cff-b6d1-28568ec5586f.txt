So Alive (Ryan Adams song)

"So Alive" is a song by singer-songwriter Ryan Adams from his 2003 album Rock n Roll.  The song was co-written with Johnny T. Yerington and was released as a single in 2004.In a 2003 interview with VH1, Adams talked about the song's background: "It was the last song [on the album] to have lyrics.  It was the last day of making the record.  I got up... walked down to Stuyvesant City Cove and watched the boats go by... I wanted to write a song about how romantic I was feeling.  [The song] has a super big falsetto.  I don't know where the hell that came from."


== Music video ==
A music video for "So Alive", shot by Doug Aitken, was produced in late 2003.  The video features Adams performing the song as he wanders through a surreal desert dreamscape characterized by snakes, giant spider webs, scraggly bushes and overall desolation. It was the subject of a behind-the-scenes "Making The Video" special on MTV2, shot at Raleigh Studios in Los Angeles. In the special, Adams refers to the "nightmare scenarios" depicted in the video, while producer/first assistant director Peter Murray calls it "a journey of the mind".  Throughout the shoot Adams is seen clowning around, cracking jokes with the crew and generally having a good time.


== B-Sides ==
The various "So Alive" singles contain several Rock n Roll outtakes as b-sides, including "Ah, Life", "Don't Even Know Her Name", "I'm Coming Over", and "Luxury"."Ah, Life", "Don't Even Know Her Name", and "I'm Coming Over" were also released on the Moroccan Role EP in 2004.Additionally, a limited edition 7" vinyl single was released with a 4-track recording of "Come Pick Me Up" as the b-side.

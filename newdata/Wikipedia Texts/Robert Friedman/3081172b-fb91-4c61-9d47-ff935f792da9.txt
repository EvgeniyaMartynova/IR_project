Robert I. Friedman

Robert I Friedman (November 29, 1950 – July 2, 2002) was an American investigative journalist.
In 1993, Friedman castigated the FBI for ignoring information it had developed on the Muslim extremists behind the first bombing of the World Trade Center. 
Robert is probably best known for his writings about violence-prone Jewish fundamentalists and the book “Red Mafiya” about the Russian MOB and its entry into the U.S.
His reporting provoked lawsuits and death threats throughout his career.
Robert I. Friedman died on July 2, 2002 in Manhattan at the age of 51.

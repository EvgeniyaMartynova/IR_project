With their companions Maruthas, Narses, Helias, Mares, Abibus, Sembeeth, and Sabas, were arrested and imprisoned at Bardiaboch,  during the persecutions of Persian king Shapur II. After being comforted and inspired by Jonas and Barachius, they withstood torture and were killed on March 27, 326.

Traditions records that brothers Jonas and Barachisius heard about the persecution, went to Bardiaboch, where the 9 were awaiting execution. they visited the monks in jail on the eve of the execution and found they had been tortured. Jonas and Barachisius gave comforting words to the prisoners and were themselves executed days later.
The 11 were buried  by Habdisotes, a notable Christian of that town.They are commemorated as pre-congregational saints in the Roman Catholic Church on March 27.

The 1st Rifles Regiment was formed on September 27, 1830 during the Belgian Revolution. They were equipped with carbines and received the title of Regiment of Carabiniers in 1850. On July 21, 1930, King Albert I decided that the regiment would bear the title of Regiment Carabiniers Prince Baudouin, in honour of his late brother (not to be confused with the king of the same name) who served within its ranks.

The Grenadier Regiment was founded on May 8, 1837 by King Leopold I. Originally designated as the Regiment of Grenadiers and Voltigeurs, it was created by bringing together the elite companies of each of the twelve regiments of line infantry then in existence. The new unit consisted of four battalions; two of grenadiers and two of voltigeurs. Renamed as the Elite Regiment a year later the unit finally received the designation of Grenadier Regiment by royal command on March 5, 1850.The new regiment was stationed in the Caserne Prince Albert, in Brussels near the Royal Palace. Today only the monument to the fallen Grenadiers remains of it. In the Hall of Grenadiers the memorabilia and the portraits of the Royal Officers are still kept.

Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince

The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Riflemen) is the Infantry branch of the Force Publique, and one of the limited number of militaries that recruits foreigners. Although Monaco's defence is the responsibility of France, Monaco maintains a small force for the protection of the Sovereign and the Prince's Palace. Formed by Prince Honoré IV in 1817, the unit was re-organised in 1909. The company numbers 119 officers and men – while the NCOs and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army or the Republican Guard. Along with the Corps des Sapeurs-Pompiers, the Carabiniers form Monaco's total public forces.


== History ==

An antecedent of the Carabiniers was the company known in the 19th century as the "Papalins", former soldiers of the Papal States, who, upon the destitution of the Papacy's temporal authority at the time of the Italian Unification, were given the role of protecting the Sovereign and the Princely Family. A road in Fontvieille is named in honour of them.In Monaco, the Milice Nationale was created in 1865. In 1870, the Milice Nationale was renamed the Gardes du Prince, although, the "Gardes" were still tasked with fire-fighting, and national security. On May 5, 1881, the Gardes du Prince were renamed the Compagnie de Sapeurs-Pompiers to better adjust to their fire-fighting duties. On June 17, 1909, the fire-fighting unit was re-organised into a separate operating company called the Compagnie de Sapeurs-Pompiers, while the protection unit was renamed the Corps des Carabiniers du Prince. This lasted over 60 years, until the companies were finally renamed the Corps des Sapeurs-Pompiers, and the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince, and were placed under the Force Publique's direct control.The Carabiniers are currently commanded by Comdt. Philippe Rebaudengo, who was sworn in on February 1, 2007. Previous commanders include, Lt. Col. Jacques Morandon (2005-2007), Lt. Col. Luc Fringant (1993-2005), and Comdt. Maurice Allent (1978-1993).

Since its inception, the Carabiniers were tasked with guarding the Prince's Palace, ensuring the security of the Sovereign and the Princely Family, to provide services to honour, and to assist law enforcement in times of need. The Palace is guarded at all times, twenty-four hours a day, with two non-commissioned officers of varying rank, one Maréchal des logis, and eight Carabiniers.

== The Band ==

The Carabiniers maintain a musical band consisting of twenty-six "rifle-musicians" under the command of a Maréchal des Logis Chef. In 1978, the title of "Fanfare de la Companies des Carabiniers" was adopted. An integral part of the unit, the band is not trained solely to perform music. Instead, Carabiniers receive the same training as their comrades. The band participates in the same occasions, and duties as the Company. The diversity of the repertoire of the band allows it to perform at official ceremonies, sporting events, and public concerts. Since 1989, the band has performed outside of Monaco, in multitudes of destinations, such as: Saumur, Nîmes, Albertville, Lugano, Düsseldorf, Turin, Lisbon, Seville, Geneva, and Hanover.


== Dress and equipment ==
The equipment and vehicles of the Carabiniers have been upgraded in recent years. Mobility has been improved by the adoption of modern vehicles, adapted to different missions, such as two MOWAG Piranha Vs, six Peugeot P4s, and seven BMW R1200RT-Ps. Old rifles and revolvers have been replaced by firearms such as the M16A2, and Glock 17.Parade dress in the winter is a modernised version of that worn in the early 1900s. It comprises a dark blue tunic, and light blue trousers with red facings. A medium-blue cloth helmet is worn, with plumes for gala occasions. White trefoil epaulettes, spats and aiguillettes date from the 19th century. In the summer a simple white shirt sleeve order is worn with a white helmet. For ordinary duties a modern police style uniform is worn with a peaked cap replacing the helmet.

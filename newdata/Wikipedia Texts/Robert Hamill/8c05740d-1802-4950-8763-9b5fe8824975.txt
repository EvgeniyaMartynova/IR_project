He came third, with 8.41% of the vote, and losing to the incumbent, National's Shane Ardern. However, he stated that his intention was not to win the seat, and did not "think that would be realistic." but campaigned for the Green party vote. Hamill describes the Green Party as "the only party with a commitment to driving policy towards a sustainable future".Hamill is a supporter of New Zealand becoming a republic, endorsing Member of Parliament Keith Locke's Head of State Referenda Bill, a private member's bill.Hamill was an ambassador for WWF's Earth Hour in 2010.He is a member of the WEL Energy Trust, and is considering standing for Environment Waikato in the 2010 local body elections.


== Brother's death ==
While on a trip from Singapore to Bangkok, Hamill's older brother, Kerry, was captured, tortured, interrogated and killed in the S-21 prison by the Khmer Rouge in 1978, after being caught in a storm on his yacht, Foxy Lady, and straying into Cambodian waters. He was aged 28 at the time of his death. Hamill was 14 when he learned of his brother's fate. The news of his brother's fate caused Hamill's other older brother, John, to commit suicide. In July 2009 Hamill testified against Duch, the leader of the prison, in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and Kerry Hamill's alleged killer, who was on trial for crimes against humanity and premeditated murder. Hamill called the experience as "going to be quite scary" and "an opportunity to find [information] out", but stipulated that he is against the death penalty, and did not want to see Duch killed, but that an ideal sentence would be forty years of imprisonment, "anything less than that would be a victory to the [Duch] defence team, I suspect".Hamill also wants to research Kerry's last few days in Northern Territory, asking Darwinians for any "precious" information about him, saying that "just anything would help".


=== Aftermath ===
Hamill's search for his brother's story has been made into a documentary film entitled Brother Number 1, funded by New Zealand on Air and TV3, and the New Zealand Film Commission, directed by Annie Goldson, and produced by Hamill, Goldson and James Bellamy. It was pitched at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto.The death of his brother, Kerry, inspired him to become an ambassador of WWF and to oppose human trafficking.

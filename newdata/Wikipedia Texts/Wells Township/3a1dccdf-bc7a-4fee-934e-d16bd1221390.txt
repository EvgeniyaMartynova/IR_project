== Politics ==
Like most of South Dakota, Perkins County is overwhelmingly Republican. No Democratic Presidential candidate has won Perkins County since Franklin D. Roosevelt did so during his 46-state landslide in 1936. Jimmy Carter in 1976 came within 36 votes of carrying the county, but since then the only Democrat to gain even 29 percent of the county’s vote has been Michael Dukakis during the drought-affected 1988 election.

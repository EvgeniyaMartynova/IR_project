Professional wrestling attacks

Attacking maneuvers are offensive moves in professional wrestling, used to set up an opponent for a submission hold or for a throw. There are a wide variety of attacking moves in pro wrestling, and many are known by several different names. Professional wrestlers frequently give their finishers new names. Occasionally, these names become popular and are used regardless of the wrestler performing the technique.
Professional wrestling contains a variety of punches and kicks found in martial arts and other fighting sports; the moves listed below are more specific to wrestling itself. Many of the moves below can also be performed from a raised platform (the top rope, the ring apron, etc.); these are called aerial variations. Moves are listed under general categories whenever possible.


== Body press ==
A maneuver that involves a wrestler attacking with the core of the body. It is executed from an upright, running position using momentum and weight to run over the opponent.


=== Body avalanche ===
The wrestler takes a short charge into an opponent in the corner of the ring without leaving the feet as he/she opens both arms just before reaching the opponent, resulting in hitting with the chest and abdominal area while throwing both arms inwards as in a bearhug, crushing the opponent into the turnbuckle. This is normally used by bigger, heavier wrestlers.


==== Stinger splash ====
A variation named after, innovated and popularized by Sting. It involves the wrestler trapping the opponent in a corner. Then the wrestler will charge at the opponent usually from the opposite corner, launching themselves and sandwiching the opponent between them and the turnbuckle as grabbing a hold on the top rope.

== Headbutt ==

An attack where a wrestler uses the head to strike a part of the opponent's body, usually the forehead or chin (unlike a legitimate headbutt), to daze him/her, counting on the superior hardness of the wrestler's head and the momentum delivered to hurt the opponent without hurting the wrestler.  Many wrestlers deliver a headbutt to an opponent's head by holding the opponent's head and delivering the headbutt to their own intervening hand instead, relying on it to cushion the blow.

Kenta, the creator of the original maneuver, also uses an inverted variation in which he lifts his opponent into an Argentine backbreaker rack, throwing the opponent forward, and striking his knee in the back of the opponent's head. He uses the original GTS as Hideo Itami in WWE since CM Punk retired from WWE.
A modified version, used by Tye Dillinger called the Tye Breaker, sees the wrestler performing the GTS but, rather than dropping the opponent in front of him to execute the move, throwing the legs of the opponent out backwards to rotate them 180°, before making the opponent land face first over the bent right knee.


=== High knee ===

An attack in which a wrestler will charge towards the opponent, then jumps up and raises a knee to hit the opponent usually into the side of the head. This move has been closely associated with Harley Race, often being referred to as a "Harley Race High-Knee". It has later been popularized as a signature move by WWE Superstars as Triple H and CM Punk.


==== Running single leg high knee ====
This variation, more akin to a running single leg dropkick, sees the attacking wrestler running and leaping towards the opponent while throwing one knee forwards to strike the opponent's face. This move was made popular in Japan by Kenta and Trent Beretta and later adopted by WWE wrestler Daniel Bryan. Wrestlers Kenny Omega, Buddy Murphy, Sheamus, Aleister Black, Dragon Lee, Matt Riddle and Mandy Rose use a bicycle variant of the knee strike.


=== Knee lift ===
An attack in which a wrestler brings the knee up to hit the opponent under the chin as if performing an uppercut. This can either be performed in mid clinch or with the attacking wrestler charging at a kneeling or bent over opponent, lifting the knee upwards to strike underneath the jaw or the side of the head. A double variation sets a wrestler standing in front of the opponent, then while performing the mid clinch leaps throwing both knees upwards to strike the opponent's chin, and releases the hold to fall back on his / her feet.


=== Shining wizard ===
A strike created by The Great Muta delivered to an opponent down on one knee. After stepping off the opponent's raised knee with one foot, the wrestler swings the other leg and strikes the opponent's head with either the side of the knee or shin. A slight variation known as shining apprentice sees the wrestler use a running enzuigiri to the kneeling opponent's head without the use of the opponent's knee for leverage. Many other "shining" attacks exist, including big boots and dropkicks. The shining wizard can be applied to a standing opponent as well; this would be likely applied by stepping off the opponent's chest and then delivering a knee smash to the opponent's face. AJ Lee and Tegan Nox are both using their moves.


=== Spinning knee ===
Also known as a discus knee or rolling knee, the wrestler advances towards a sitting or bent over opponent, performs a 360° spin and uses the momentum to deliver a jumping knee strike to the opponent's head.

Involves the attacker originally facing his opponent. Then turning 180° and bending the rear leg at the knee or extending it backwards in full, exploiting the turning momentum to strike the opponent in the chest or stomach. Also known as reverse side kick or heel kick. It is a very popular attack in Mexico, known by its original name La Filomena, for it was innovated and named by Murciélago Velázquez. A jumping back kick is a variation that involves the attacker conducting the turning motion while jumping.
Even though several other kicks may be confused with a back kick, it must be considered that this attacks are indistinctively applied heel/calf-first.


==== Calf kick ====
This kick starts with a standing wrestler jumping to either side, connecting the side of their lead leg's calf-heel cord area to the opponent's face or chest.


===== Leg lariat =====
Also referred to as jumping leg lariat or running calf kick, it sees an attacking wrestler charging towards an opponent, then taking a sidestep, he/she jumps and wraps their lead leg's kneepit around the opponent's head or neck knocking them to the ground.  A variation has the attacking wrestler standing on the top turnbuckle or springboarding from the top rope to get the required height to execute it.


===== Spin kick =====
Also known as reverse roundhouse kick, it sees the attacking wrestler spinning 360° on their rear foot gaining power and momentum from spinning in place, then connecting their lead foot's heel/calf to a charging opponent's face. It is common to see this move executed after an opponent is Irish whipped off the ropes. A short-arm variation is also possible.


===== Spinning heel kick =====

A jumping version of the spin kick that usually involves the wrestler spinning 360° so their body is somewhat horizontal before hitting the opponent with the back of their leg(s) or heel(s) on the opponent's face or chest.

==== Superkick ====

Often referred to as side kick or crescent kick, it sees the wrestler delivering a kick with the lead foot to the opponent's face, chin, neck or breastbone, usually preceded by a sidestep. "Gentleman" Chris Adams is credited for its innovation. It is famously the finisher of Shawn Michaels, who calls it Sweet Chin Music and occasionally adds theatrics before using the move. The Young Bucks also use the move. Carmella uses this as her finisher calling it princess kick and so do the Usos. Dolph Ziggler uses this move.


=== Sole kick ===
A thrust where the wrestler turns the torso away lifting one leg horizontally and extending it torwards the opponent, striking in the torso with the sole of their foot. A spin kick variation sees the wrestler spin around and then performing the kick with the outer leg, which is known as rolling sole butt in Japan. There is also jumping variation where the wrestler jumps straight up, spins in the air, and then delivers the sole butt with the outer leg targeting the head of the opponent.
A sole kick can be differentiated from any other because it is always applied with the ball/core of the foot in a thrusting fashion.


==== Big boot ====

Otherwise known as Yakuza kick. This attack is usually done with the opponent charging towards the wrestler, using the opponent's momentum to deliver the wrestler's sole to the upper-body or head. This move is commonly performed by tall wrestlers to enhance its view as a strong attack even though the wrestler themselves are not moving and the opponent is running into the foot, and because of that their height makes it easy for their legs to reach the head of normal-sized wrestlers. There is also an arched variation of this move. Big Cass uses this move. Sami Zayn uses this move calling it the Helluva kick. Billie Kay also uses this move calling it the Shades of Kay.


==== Bicycle kick ====

An attacking wrestler jumps up and kicks forward with one foot after the other in a pedalling motion, with the foot that gets lifted second being extended fully to catch a charging opponent directly in the face. Another variation sees the attacking wrestler charge at a standing opponent before delivering the attack. Similar in effect to the big boot. This move is used by Sheamus as a finisher, the Brogue Kick. AJ Styles also uses this move in a similar manner to the professional football player Pelé calling it the Pele Kick.


==== Dropkick ====

An attack where the wrestler jumps up and kicks the opponent with the soles of both feet, this usually sees the wrestler twist as they jump so that when the feet connect with the opponent one foot is raised higher that the other (depending on which way they twist) and the wrestlers fall back to the mat on their side or front. This is commonly employed by light and nimble wrestlers who can take advantage of their agility.


==== Legsweep ====
The wrestler drops to one knee and extends the other leg to knock away the opponent's legs, then quickly pivots their body around.


==== Mule kick ====
While facing away from a charging opponent, the wrestler bends down and pushes out one foot, striking the opponent with the bottom of it. A double mule kick variation is usually done with the wrestler facing away from the opponent, bending over and making a handstand. If acrobatically inclined, the wrestler can then roll forward, back into a standing position. Sometimes done in a corner, the wrestler takes hold on the top rope and kicks backwards with both legs to the opponent, hitting with both soles.


==== Savate kick ====
The most commonly used savate kick in wrestling is the Chassé jambe arriére, a piston-action kick to an opponent's head or chin. This kick is often confused with the Superkick but it can be differentiated for it is performed from an upright stance with the rear foot, instead of the lead foot. Rusev calls it Machka Kick.


=== Toe kick ===

This kick, used by almost all wrestlers, is appealed just for show or as a setup for a hold or throw. The most common way to perform this attack sees the wrestler striking the opponent upwards in the midsection or stomach to bend the opponent over. Another variation sees the wrestler holding back their own foot with one hand, taking it up their side or lower back and releasing it, striking a bent over opponent in the back of the head.
This maneuver can be differentiated from any other kick noting that it is always performed striking with the point of the foot-instep-shin area.


==== Backflip kick ====
Also known as Pelé kick after the association football player, the attacker performs a standing back flip while having their back to the opponent. The attacker then hits the opponent in the head with one or both legs, with the wrestler usually landing on hands and feet facing downward. There are many variations of this maneuver since it can be performed from a backroll, a corckscrew, a handspring or a handstand.


===== Corner backflip kick =====
This variation, also known as tiger wall flip and popularized by Satoru Sayama, sees an opponent propped up in the corner as an attacking wrestler charges towards them, running up the ropes (beside the opponent), or in some cases, up the opponent, and, as he/she reaches the top, kicking off the opponent's chest to perform a backflip so the wrestler lands on their hands and feet.


==== Cartwheel kick ====
The wrestler performs a cartwheel towards the opponent, hitting them in the head with the rear leg's shin as it comes up in the air. Popularized by Ernest "The Cat" Miller.


==== Crane kick ====
The wrestler first performs a crane stance, by standing on one leg, with the other knee raised and arms extended in a crane position. The wrestler then strikes the opponent's head or face with either the standing or raised leg.


==== Enzuigiri ====
The term Enzui is the Japanese word for medulla oblongata and giri means "to chop". Thus, an enzuigiri (often misspelled 'ensuigiri' or 'enzuiguri') is any attack that strikes the back of the head. It is usually associated with lighter weight class wrestlers, as well as wrestlers who have a martial arts background or gimmick. It is often used as a counter-move after a kick is blocked and the leg caught, or the initial kick is a feint to set up the real attack. A common variation of the enzuigiri sees the wrestler stepping up the opponent's midsection, and hitting the back of the opponent's head with the other foot.


===== Jumping high kick =====
Properly called Gamengiri (from the original Japanese Gamen / "face" and Giri / "Cut"), it is a variation of an enzuigiri where the wrestler jumps up not taking a step or hold with the lead foot and kicks the opponent in the side of the head/face. Sonya Deville uses this move.


==== Overhead kick ====
In this version, the wrestler either starts by lying down or dropping down on the mat while the opponent stands near to their head. The wrestler then throws a leg and kicks up over their waist and chest, hitting the opponent with the point of the foot, usually in the head. It can be used as a counter to an attack from behind. For example, an opponent attempts a full nelson, the wrestler breaks the opponent's lock by raising both arms, falling to the canvas back-first and kicking the opponent in the head with one foot.


==== Shoot kick ====
A kickboxing-style kick with the shin (generally protected by a shin guard) striking an opponent's face, chest or thighs. This move is used in shoot-style environments and by many Japanese wrestlers. In WWE, Daniel Bryan popularized the shoot kicks as the Yes! Kicks while the crowd would respond with a chant of "Yes!" every time a kick connected.


===== Football kick =====
Sometimes also referred to as soccer kick. The wrestler strikes an opponent sitting on the mat with the foot extended downwards vertically from the base of the spine to the back's midsection. Used by Katsuyori Shibata as the P.K. (penalty kick).


===== Punt =====
Based on the field goal kick but named for the punt kick used in American football, sees the wrestler taking a run up to a kneeling opponent and strike them in the head with the point of the foot. It is similar to the soccer kick in MMA. WWE wrestler Randy Orton performed this move as his finisher maneuver to cause storyline concussions.


===== Roundhouse kick =====
Properly speaking, a roundhouse kick in wrestling is a variation of a shoot kick with a slight difference. While in the later (a proper roundhouse kick in execuition) the attack stops after connecting the opponent, in a roundhouse kick the wrestler will keep spinning well passed a sitting/kneeling opponent's head or a standing opponent's ribcage, giving a 180 or even a full 360° turn.


==== Tiger feint kick ====
A move in which a wrestler jumps through the second and top rope while holding on to the ropes, using the momentum to swing back around into the ring. Originally performed as a fake dive to make opponents and fans think that the wrestler was about to dive through the ropes to opponents outside of the ring, later modified to become a kick to the head of an opponent who is hung on the second rope. This move requires high agility and is mainly used by smaller wrestlers in Japan and Mexico. Popularized internationally by Rey Mysterio, who called the move 619 (after the area code for Mysterio's hometown).


== Lariat ==
In wrestling, a lariat is performed when an attacking wrestler runs towards an opponent and wraps an arm around the opponent's upper chest or neck, forcing him / her to the ground. This move is similar to a clothesline, the difference being that in a clothesline the wrestler's arm is kept straight to his / her side during the move, while in the lariat the wrestler strikes the opponent with his arm often in a swinging motion and sometimes dropping face first besides the opponent.
Typically, a lariat is used as a finishing move while the clothesline is simply a basic strike attack. The main difference aside from the mechanics of the movement is the stiffness, a lariat is essentially a very stiff, swinging clothesline.


=== Crooked arm lariat ===
It is performed when an attacking wrestler runs towards an opponent with the arm bent upward at the elbow 60–90 degrees, wraps the arm around the opponent's neck forcing him / her to the ground. Hulk Hogan is often referred as its innovator.

=== Short-arm lariat ===
A variation where the wrestler grabs one of the opponent's wrists with a hand and pulls the opponent closer, striking with his / her other arm. This can also be used in combination with a hammerlock as in the case of Ariya Daivari.

This maneuver is performed when the wrestler doesn't run but simply strikes the opponent while standing next to them or waiting for a charging opponent. Popularized by Stan Hansen. The wrestler can also hold the opponent's head up before performing the lariat with his / her other arm. Kenta Kobashi uses this variation as one of his many finishing moves called Burning lariat.


== Palm strike ==
This move sees the wrestler delivering an open-handed strike with arm movement akin to a cross, usually to the opponent's chin, face or chest. This is a legitimate offensive-defensive maneuver in karate known as Shotei uchi and is often performed by wrestlers with known martial arts background, particularly in Japan where is often associated to former sekitori. Several of these attacks can also be performed with the opponent in a side headlock.


=== Forehand chop ===
Sometimes referred to as a frying pan or an open-hand chop. Despite of the name, it refers to a slap properly and not a chop. The wrestler strikes downwards the chest, nape or back of an opponent, using the open palm of the hand.


==== Double open hand chop ====
Also called blazing chop, this variation sees a standing wrestler striking the chest of a charging opponent with both palms sideways, shoving them down to the mat back first.


=== Slap ===
The wrestler delivers an overpowering open-hand slap crossing the opponent's face, ears, or nape. This simple strike is more often performed by female wrestlers or villains. A variation associated to Dusty Rhodes and his family involves a charging wrestler attacking with a slap as if performing a clothesline.


==== Double slap ====
Also known as a bell clap, the wrestler slaps both ears of an opponent simultaneously with the palms of both hands, disorienting their balance. It is often used as a counter for a bear hug.


=== Uppercut ===

Properly speaking, an uppercut is a punch used in boxing that usually aims at the opponent's chin. It is, along with the hook and the overhand, one of the main punches that count in statistics as a "Power punch", while in wrestling, any close-fisted punch is considered an illegal attack. Therefore, it is an upward variant of a palm strike in execution. Usually seen performed by tall, heavy wrestlers like Kane and Goldust.Nevertheless, a close-fisted uppercut has been seen in wrestling from time to time usually meant as a "cheap shot". Extensively used by "Rowdy" Roddy Piper in that same matter.


== Punch ==
An illegal attack using a simple close-fisted punch normally to the stomach, lower back or head of the opponent. Unlike most illegal attacks, punches almost never result in disqualification. Instead, the referee simply admonishes the wrestler to stop, usually to no effect. Punches are often used by both villains and heroes alike. However, when villains perform the strike while either the opponent is not expecting it, or when the referee is in some way distracted, it seems more devastating.
Several boxing punches can be found in wrestling, such as jabs, straights, hooks and overhands.


=== Back fist ===
Often aimed at a kneeling opponent or one sat on the top turnbuckle. In this variation of a simple close-fisted punch, the wrestler strikes the opponent with the back of the fist in the head or chest, often repeatedly.


==== Spinning back fist ====

The wrestler holds an arm out horizontally and executes a back fist whilst turning the body swiftly, hitting the opponent on rotation.


=== Discus punch ===
Also named spinning punch or tornado punch. The attacker performs a 180 or 360° degree turn similar to a discus motion and hits the opponent in the head with a swinging hook.


=== Flapjack punch ===
The attacker lifts a charging opponent up in the air as if performing a back body drop but instead of tossing him / her over the head, the attacker pushes the opponent upward performing a flapjack. As the opponent falls to the mat face-first, the attacker hits the opponent with a liver shot. Popularized by Ludvig Borga.


=== Heart punch ===
The wrestler raises the opponent's left arm up over his / her head, sometimes folding it back behind the neck as well, then delivers a strong straight into the side of the ribcage. The move is alleged to rely on "Oriental pressure points" to strike a nerve causing the opponent's heart to momentarily stop, rendering them unconscious. Stan "The Man" Stasiak, Ox Baker and Big John Studd are professional wrestlers well known for their use of the heart punch as a wrestling maneuver.


=== Mounted punches ===
This attack involves a wrestler standing on the middle or top ropes and delivering repeated crosses to the face while the opponent is backed up against the turnbuckles. A variation sees the wrestler striking a fallen opponent either mounting in front of them or kneeling besides and having the opponent in a side headlock. The crowd tends to count the punches, which typically end at ten, provided they're not interrupted by the opponent pushing the wrestler off or by the referee admonishing the attacking wrestler.


=== Superman punch ===

This attack sees a wrestler leap into the air, snapping the rear leg back before striking with a swinging overhand to the opponent's head. Popularized by Roman Reigns.


=== Wind-up punch ===
A theatrical variation in which the wrestler rotates the attacking arm in a "winding-up" motion before striking the opponent, making the punch appear more effective in the same way of a bolo punch in boxing.


== Senton ==
In the same sense of a press or a splash the wrestler jumps over an opponent, but in this case the attacker falls lower-back first or into a sitting position.In Spanish, the word senton (Properly spelled as Sentón) refers to landing on the lower back or buttocks after taking a fall. Either on purpose (as for comedic effect) or accidentally.


=== Body guillotine ===
Having a fallen opponent lying next to the apron, the attacking wrestler grabs either the opponent's head, torso or leg and places it on the bottom rope. Taking hold of the top rope, the wrestler proceeds to jump and sit repeatedly on the opponent's neck, chest or leg as he/she stomps hard, to hurt or incapacitate the opponent.


==== Leapfrog body guillotine ====

This move sees the opponent's chest resting on the second rope, facing out of the ring. The attacker running from behind performs a leapfrog and lands on his opponent's back, neck or head, sliding through the ropes out of the ring as he/she forces the opponent's chest against the second rope.


=== Bronco buster ===
With an opponent seated in the corner of the ring, the attacking wrestler jumps in the corner, straddling on the opponent's midsection, bouncing up and down. Often treated as having comic or sexual connotations rather than as a legitimately painful move.


==== Koronco buster ====
Similar to a bronco buster, the attacking wrestler jumps onto a standing opponent in the corner, straddling and sitting on the opponent's chest, while resting feet on the second rope. The attacking wrestler then follows with mounted punches.


=== Hip attack ===

Also named rear view or butt thump, is usually performed with a running start, then the attacking wrestler jumps into the air, spinning around, and thrusting the pelvis backwards, thus hitting the opponent's face or chest with hip or buttocks. Another variation called reverse body avalanche sees large, heavy wrestlers giving the back to a cornered opponent as they take hold on the top rope, thrusting the pelvis repeatedly against the opponent's midsection as if performing turnbuckle thrusts.


=== Seated senton ===
Also known as vertical splash or butt drop, is the most common form to perform this maneuver. A wrestler jumps down to a sitting position across the chest or stomach of a fallen opponent. This particular move is usually executed one of two ways. One is to see the wrestler stand over the opponent and drop to either a seated position (like Rikishi) or a kneeling position (like Bastion Booger's Trip to the Batcave). The other is performed with the opponent lying near one of the turnbuckles, with the wrestler climbing to the middle rope and bouncing on it before performing the senton (Yokozuna's Banzai Drop). A variation of the seated senton was performed by Earthquake, whose Earthquake Splash would see him run off the ropes to gain momentum for the senton and then jump onto the opponent while running. It is also an obvious and often-used counter to the sunset flip.


=== Somersault senton ===
Another slight variation on a standard senton sees the attacking wrestler jump and flip forward 180° so that the lower back impacts on the opponents chest or head.


==== Cannonball ====
A somersault senton performed to an opponent sitting in a corner to be sandwiched between the turnbuckle and the wrestler's lower back.


=== Stink Face ===
This move sees a wrestler sits while rubbing the buttocks in the face of an opponent lying in the corner of the ring, humiliating the opponent. Popularized by Rikishi.


== Shoulder block ==
A maneuver that sees a standing wrestler strike usually ramming with a shoulder, by keeping an arm down by the side into a charging opponent's chest or abdomen. However, often this will see a larger wrestler displaying superior size and strength by challenging an opponent to attack, standing still slightly to one side and having the opponent charging towards trying to execute a strike, only to get knocked down (often several times) and see any attempt of the hapless opponent having no effect. A slight variation called body block, sees an opponent run at the large wrestler who would simply engulf the charging opponent by swinging their arms round and forcing the opponent to impact the wrestler's entire body.


=== Chop block ===
This variation, based on the illegal American football block, sees the wrestler performing this attack coming from behind an opponent and droping down to connect with their shoulder into the back of one of the opponent's knees. This is often used to weaken the leg for submission holds, as noted by Ric Flair's extensive use of the move as a set-up for his Figure Four Leglock.


=== Pounce ===
The attacking wrestler runs the ropes to gain momentum before leaping at the opponent with a high shoulder block. This variation is usually preceded by an Irish Whip to an adjacent side of the ring, or to cut-off an opponent already running the ropes, further increasing the move' s  impact. It was popularized by Monty Brown and named for his Alpha Male gimmick. The move is also used by Mojo Rawley, Keith Lee and Lance Archer.


=== Short-arm shoulder block ===
A variation where the wrestler grasps one of the opponent's wrists firmly with both hands and pulls the opponent's arm towards them. From this point on, the attack can be executed one of two ways. In one the wrestler rams their shoulder repeatedly against the opponent's own to incapacitate or hurt the arm, setting it up for a submission or as a mean of punishment. Popularized by Diamond Dallas Page and Batista.
In the other, the wrestler strikes lunging their shoulder against the opponent's chest or chin, then releasing the hold to leave the opponent fall to the mat. This maneuver was performed extensively by Beth Phoenix.


=== Spear ===

This sets an attacking wrestler charging towards a standing opponent, bringing the body parallel to the ground and driving one shoulder into the opponent's midsection, pulling on their legs, as in a double leg takedown, and forcing them back-first into the mat. This simple, but powerful-looking move has been used by many famous wrestlers as a finisher, notably including Goldberg, Edge, Bobby Lashley, Roman Reigns, Batista, and Charlotte Flair.


==== Striking spear ====

In this variation, the wrestler does not pull on the opponent's legs in a double leg takedown, relying only on the strike's momentum to force the opponent down. Rhyno uses this variation as his finisher, The Gore.


==== Spear with multiple punches ====
This variation of spear is laying the opponent down with a spear and punch him with Thesz press punches. This variation is popularized by WWE Superstars Shane McMahon and Brie Bella


=== Turnbuckle thrust ===
This move is performed to an opponent set up resting back first against the turnbuckle. Then the wrestler takes hold of the second rope both hands opening their arms, and strikes driving the attacking shoulder into the opponent's midsection, often repeatedly, as he/she  swings the legs back and forth to gain momentum. A variation sees smaller wrestlers using the top of their heads instead of the shoulder or running from the center of the ring.


== Splash ==

A Splash is an attack very similar to a body press in function but not in execution, the difference lies in that it is executed from a falling position, most of the times the attack is performed horizontally, and most variations can seamlessly transition into a pin.


=== Big splash ===

This maneuver involves a wrestler jumping forward and landing stomach-first across an opponent lying on the ground below. On some occasions a wrestler has a short running start before executing the move.


=== Cartwheel splash ===
The attacking wrestler performs a cartwheel before landing stomach-first across an opponent lying on the mat. Usually perfomered by small, nimble wrestlers men or women.


=== Crossbody ===
Also known as crossbody block, it sets a wrestler jumping onto his opponent and landing horizontally across the opponent's torso, forcing the opponent to the mat and usually resulting in a pinfall attempt. There is also an aerial variation, known as a diving crossbody, where wrestler leaps from an elevated position towards the opponent. This attack is known as a Plancha in Lucha libre.


==== Tilt-a-whirl crossbody ====
An uncommon variation of the move which sees the wrestler being held and spun into a tilt-a-whirl by the opponent, when the wrestler reaches a point where he / she is horizontally positioned against the opponent's torso, falls down pushing down the opponent onto the back against the canvas. This move is better described as a counter for a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker, or for a tilt-a-whirl mat slam.


== Stomp ==
Also known as foot stomp, this attack sees a wrestler stamping a foot on any part of a fallen opponent. One variation performed by large, heavy wrestlers implies simply to step on the opponent's stomach as they walk, often referred to as a big walk. This variation, when performed by a villain, aims to the head of the opponent but in a crudest, vicious way.


=== Curb stomp ===

Seth Rollins' version of the move is a running stomp to the back of the head of a bent-over opponent, forcing the opponent face-first into the ground. It was eventually banned from use by WWE in 2015, before Rollins would return to using this move as a finisher in early 2018. Impact Wrestling wrestler Laurel Van Ness also uses this move as a finishing move.


=== Double foot stomp ===
When a wrestler jumps and stamps both feet on any part of an opponent. Also known as double stomp. This can be performed from an elevated position as a diving double foot stomp. Large, heavy wrestlers often perform this move by simply standing over a defenseless opponent next to the apron both feet and grabbing a hold on the top rope, squashing the fallen body.


=== Garvin stomp ===
A wrestler performs a series of stomps all over the body of a fallen opponent in the order of left arm, left chest, left stomach, left upper leg, left lower leg, right lower leg, right upper leg, right stomach, right chest, right arm, and finally the jaw. Innovated by and named after the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ron Garvin in the late 1980s. It was later popularized by Randy Orton.


== Transition moves ==
Some moves are meant neither to pin an opponent, nor weaken them or force them to submit, but are intended to set up the opponent for another attack.


=== Discus ===
This is a move in which a wrestler will spin in place before hitting an attack, like the discus clothesline, discus punch, or the discus forearm. The move is usually used instead of charging towards an opponent to build up momentum for an attack, often the discus spin is used to evade incoming attacks.


=== Handspring ===
The wrestler runs towards the ropes and performs a handstand right next to them, using his momentum to throw his legs against the ropes, using the spring to throw himself backwards back onto his feet, and using the momentum still to leap backwards, usually to deliver an attack. A back elbow strike variation is the most common. Another common variation of the handspring transition sees the attacking wrestler Irish-whip their opponent onto a turnbuckle from an adjacent corner. Once the opponent crashes with their back onto the turnbuckle, the wrestler immediately performs a handspring combo towards the opponent across the ring. The acrobatic combination usually consists of a cartwheel followed by one or two back-tucks leaving the wrestler's back facing the opponent. When the wrestler is in close range of the opponent, they are free to use the momentum of the handspring combination to leap backwards and strike with either a back-elbow, a back-thump, a dropkick or any other convenient attack.


=== High impact ===
Sometimes abbreviated to "Hi-impact", this term defines any attack performed by a charging wrestler with enough speed and momentum that once started it can not be stopped. The opponents receiving such attacks can be against the ropes/turnbuckle, lying on the mat or even trying to perform an attack against the charging wrestler themselves.


=== Leapfrog ===
Named after the children's game, is an evasion maneuver that sees a wrestler standing in front of an incoming opponent as he/she leaps upwards performing a split, so the opponent misses their onrush. It can also be employed to set up an attack.


=== Matrix ===
This is an evasion performed by bending over backwards into a bridging position to counter any clothesline, punch, etc. This is named after The Matrix film series, as it is performed similarly to when Neo, in the movies, avoids a string of bullets.


=== Pendulum ===
This is a move in which a wrestler performs a tilting sequence, similar to that of an actual pendulum, in between the ring ropes (usually near a ringpost) in order to gain momentum to perform an attack or a counterattack. The usual move was the clothesline or a lariat. Nigel McGuiness known for utilize it as the Jawbreaker Lariat, Dean Ambrose as the Lunatic Lariat and Kyle O'Reilly as the Nigel.


=== Rolling Thunder ===

A rolling thunder refers to the action of a forward roll towards an opponent using the complete rotation to spring up onto their feet and into the air and perform an attack. The most popular version of this ends it with a jumping somersault senton. Rob Van Dam popularized this move.


=== Short-arm ===
This transitioning maneuver is a set up for a short ranged attack, performed by Irish-whipping the opponent, but holding onto the wrist. When the held arm is completely extended, the wrestler pulls the opponent back and strikes them with the free arm. Alternatively, the Irish whip is used instead of or repleaced by an arm wrench or a wrist lock, or by simply grabbing a hold of one of the opponent's wrists with one the wrestler's hands, pulling it towards themselves and striking with their spare arm or going for a hold or sweep.


=== Skin the cat ===
This defensive maneuver is used when a wrestler is thrown over the top rope. While being thrown over the wrestler grabs the top rope with both hands and holds on so that he ends up dangling from the top rope but not landing on the apron or on the floor. The wrestler then proceeds to lift his legs over his head and rotates his body back towards the ring to go back over the top rope and into the ring, landing in the ring on his feet. The wrestler can also perform a head scissor hold or a type of kick to strike an opponent on the inside to throw him over.  This is a tactic that can be deployed Royal Rumble or Battle Royal matches to save themselves from being eliminated, or to set up another springboard maneuver or a top rope maneuver in a normal match. This move was made famous by Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat and Shawn Michaels.


== Illegal attacks ==
In kayfabe, any attack meant to incapacitate or disable an opponent is theoretically an offense punishable by disqualification in regular singles or team matches. Typically performed when the referee is disabled or otherwise distracted. However, most of these attacks are legal in hardcore or no-disqualification matches.


=== Cheap shots ===
Mainly used by villains, often wrestlers will perform these strikes while the referee is in some way distracted. In lucha libre, this is referred to as a "fault" or "foul". The most well-known illegal moves are those that attack the groin of a male wrestler.


==== Back rake ====
The attacking wrestler drags both hands´ seized fingers down the opponent's back, to cause pain and discomfort.


==== Biting ====
The wrestler seizes a body part of the opponent and bites down with their teeth. Biting is often used when a wrestler is "trapped", either in a corner of the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move.


==== Eye poke ====
Also called a thumb to the eye.  When a wrestler pokes his thumb or finger(s) into an opponent's eye(s).


==== Eye rake ====
This is when a wrestler moves his hand down past an opponent's eye(s), making it appear that the wrestler has dragged their fingers across the opponent's eye(s), to cause pain and visual problems.


==== Hair pull ====
As the name implies, this move sees one wrestler take advantage of another's long hair by pulling it. In modern mainstream wrestling, it is more commonly used by female wrestlers. Similarly to a submission hold in the ropes, or a choke, the wrestler is given a five count to stop, before being disqualified.


==== Hangman ====
Seen when a wrestler who is on the opposite side of the ring ropes from an opponent (on the 'apron') grabs him by the head and drops down, forcing the opponent's throat across the ropes. This is an illegal attack because of its use of the rope. A common variation sees the wrestler perform a catapult to the opponent while the opponent is lying down in between the bottom and second ropes.


===== Reverse hangman =====
Similar to the normal hangman, which sees the wrestler standing outside the ring or on the apron, grabs the back of the opponent's head or neck (who is lying against the set of ropes, facing to the inside of the ring) into the ropes. The move can be alternatively called a "reverse" hotshot.


==== Low blow ====

A direct shot to the groin of an opponent; otherwise known as a groin attack, utilized by heel wrestlers such as Ric Flair. It is an offense punishable by disqualification. This illegal attack is mainly used by heel superstars or valets to gain the upper hand on their male opponents. Although kicking an opponent in the groin is the most obvious method, the most popular version sees an attacking wrestler drop to their knees and raise their arm up between the opponent's legs, striking the groin with the inside of their elbow-joint. Shinsuke Nakamura, Seth Rollins and Daniel Bryan are other wrestlers who use the move.


==== Testicular claw ====
A version of a clawhold in which a wrestler will grab hold of an opponent by the testicles and squeeze. This is an illegal maneuver mainly used by wrestlers to gain the upper hand on their opponents and is an offense punishable by disqualification. Another version rarely used in woman's wrestling is called the Vaginal Claw.


=== Foreign objects ===
Many items are used as weapons in professional wrestling. Some of the more common weapons used include chairs, guitars, folding tables, lifting belts, title belts, "kendo sticks", trash cans and bells. While picking up the upper half of the ring steps for use as a weapon is illegal, slamming an opponent into the ring steps is not considered illegal, though it is frowned upon.


==== Asian mist ====
The illegal maneuver of spitting a colored liquid into the face of an opponent in professional wrestling. After doing so, the opponent will (in storyline) be blinded and experience intense stinging in the eyes. Asian mist can come in almost any color, but the most common one used is green. This was created by The Great Kabuki and popularized by The Great Muta,Tajiri and Asuka The mist is generally made from food coloring and water or powdered drink mix and generally stored in a small bag or capsule to be put into the mouth for later use away from a camera.


==== Chair shot ====

A wrestler simply hits the opponent with a chair. In modern wrestling folding chairs are used with the strike being performed with the flat face of the chair to slow the swing and distribute the impact, to prevent injury. Although chair shots to the body are legal in the WWE, chair shots to the head were banned in March 2010, due to high risk of concussion and long term brain damage.


===== Chair thrust =====
This chair shot variation sees the wrestler placing the top of a folded chair under the opponent's chin or by the Adam's Apple, and then while holding the chair with one hand and the back of the opponent's head with another, the wrestler hits the mat with the legs of the folded chair while still placed under the opponent's chin and simultaneously forcing the opponent's head down, thus highly damaging that part of the opponent. The move can be alternatively called a guillotine shot.


===== Con-chair-to =====
This particular attack was popularized by Edge and Christian and involved two wrestlers sandwiching an opponent's head between two chairs with a simultaneous chair shot from both sides. The "One Man Con-chair-to" involves a wrestler placing their opponent so that they are horizontal with their head resting on a chair, then hitting their head from above with a second chair, squashing the head of the opponent between both.


==== Fireball ====
The wrestler (using a concealed lighter) lights a piece of flash paper or a firecracker and throws it at the opponent, giving the impression of a supernatural ball of fire emerging from their hand. Other variation sets a wrestler spitting a flammable substance (e.g. alcohol) onto a lighter or torch.


==== Guitar shot ====
Simply involves breaking a guitar over an opponent's head. Also known as the El Kabong, a reference to Quick Draw McGraw who would say this phrase prior to hitting someone with a guitar. This was used by The Honky Tonk Man, Jeff Jarrett, and most recently, Elias (Samson).

His father, Bill Cranstoun, promoted Jamaican music in the 1960s.

He began to write songs at the age of 16.

Cranstoun spent twenty years as a street busker in London, and once was given 30p by Prime Minister Tony Blair.Cranstoun met his wife, Tamu, while singing in Croydon. They have a daughter and a son.
He left the Dualers in 2010.
He adopted a style that had more Rock or Rhythm and blues.
He formed a band which started to get hired to perform in pubs and small venues.
He said of the difficulty in getting started, "they just saw me as a reggae artist doing bebop and were a bit like: 'What is he doing here?'"
In 2013 he performed with Little Richard in Las Vegas.
He was spotted in April that year and signed up with Warner.
His single Caught in the Moonlight was shortlisted on the Radio 2 playlist.


== Style ==
Cranstoun has said that Elvis Presley's music was the first music he ever listened to, and Presley profoundly influenced his taste.
He told an interviewer, "As a kid I used to spend all my pocket money on vintage records from the '50's and '60's. I got it home, listened to it, loved it, sang along to it."
His style draws heavily on music of this period.
He said of his single Never Gonna Let You Go, "Motown Soul fused with Rock 'n' Roll. Well, they said it could never be done so this song is going to prove them wrong." 
Chris Evans described his vintage pop as, "A squeeze of the Bee Gees, a bit of Billy Joel, a dash of Dean Friedman, and a ripple of Rodriguez."

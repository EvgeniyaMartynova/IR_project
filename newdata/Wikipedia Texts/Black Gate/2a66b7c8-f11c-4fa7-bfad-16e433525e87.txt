Black Gate (magazine)

Black Gate was a glossy fantasy magazine and published by New Epoch Press. Using the slogan "Adventures in Fantasy Literature," Black Gate primarily featured original short fiction up to novella length.
In addition to fiction, Black Gate also featured reviews of fantasy novels, graphic novels, and role playing game products. This was supplemented by columns and articles reflecting on fantasy literature's past as well as the occasional interview. Every issue contained the comic Knights of the Dinner Table: Java Joint by Kenzer & Company of Knights of the Dinner Table fame.
Much of the fiction was by lesser known or new authors, but noted contributors have included Michael Moorcock, Mike Resnick, Charles de Lint and Cory Doctorow. As a semi-regular feature, Black Gate reprinted rare adventure stories from earlier decades or work from more recent years that the editors feel has been neglected.  For instance, issues featured serialized Tumithak novels from Charles R. Tanner.
While officially a quarterly publication, it was never produced on a reliable schedule.  Its 15th and (to date) final issue was published in 2011.


== Critical response ==
On its debut, Black Gate received strong reviews in Locus and elsewhere, many citing the sheer size of the issues (usually 200+ pages) and the high production values. This has proved quite ambitious, though. Various production problems have led to publication less frequent than the intended quarterly schedule. While John O'Neill made a public commitment to readers and advertisers to get production back on track, the magazine never achieved a reliable quarterly release.
In 2008, Judith Berman's story "Awakening" in Black Gate #10 was a finalist for the Nebula Award.

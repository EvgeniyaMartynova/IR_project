Vinayaditya (Hoysala dynasty)

Vinayaditya (r. 1047 â€“ 1098 CE), an able Jain king of the Hoysala Empire, who distinguished himself as an able feudatory of the Kalyani Chalukyas during his long reign. He helped bring many small Malnad chiefs like the Kongalvas, Chengalvas, Santharas of Humcha Shimoga and the Kadambas of Bayalnadu (Vainadu) under control. After the complete disappearance of the Gangas during Chola occupation of Gangavadi, Vinayaditya brought some small portions of Gangavadi under his control. He was either a brother-in-law or father-in-law of Chalukya Someshvara I.

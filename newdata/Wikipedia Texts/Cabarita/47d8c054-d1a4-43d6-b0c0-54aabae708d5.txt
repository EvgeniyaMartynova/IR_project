== History ==
Cabarita is an Aboriginal word meaning by the water.David Anderson, a private soldier in the NSW Corps was granted land in this area in 1795. An area of Cabarita Point was reserved for public recreation in 1856. The reserve was expanded in 1880 with the addition of 9.7 hectares of adjoining land, known as Correy's Garden. The pavilion from which Governor-General Lord Hopetoun proclaimed the Federation of Australia in 1901 was later moved from Centennial Park to Cabarita Park.
In the past, the suburb consisted of swampland and heavy industry (only the Bushell's coffee and tea factory/warehouse remains). Housing developments replaced the industry and the swamps were reclaimed to create golf courses. Until 1948, an electric tramway ran down Cabarita Road to connect the suburb with Burwood, Enfield and Ashfield via Cabarita Junction near the corner of Mortlake Street.

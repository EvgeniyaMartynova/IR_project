George Spence (MP)

George Spence (1787–1850) was an English jurist and politician.


== Life ==
The second son of Thomas Richard Spence, a surgeon of Hanover Square, London, he was educated at a private school at Richmond, Surrey, and at the University of Glasgow, where he matriculated in 1802, and graduated M.A. on 11 April 1805. After some time spent in the office of a London solicitor, he was admitted in 1806 a student at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar on 28 June 1811; he was then elected a bencher in 1835, reader in 1845, and treasurer in 1846.A pupil of the equity draughtsman John Bell, Spence rapidly acquired an extensive practice, most of which he lost on taking silk (27 December 1834). He was returned to parliament in the Tory interest for Reading on 20 June 1826, but was unseated on petition (26 March 1827). He then (2 March 1829) secured the Ripon seat, which he retained as Member of Parliament until the dissolution of December 1832. Both in and out of parliament he made some ineffectual attempts to raise the question of chancery reform. In the divisions on the Great Reform Bill he voted against his party; he did not, however, seek election to the new parliament.On 12 December 1850 Spence died of self-inflicted wounds at his residence, 42 Hyde Park Square.

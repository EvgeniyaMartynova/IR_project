== Professional career ==


=== Calgary Stampeders ===
Parker was drafted 3rd overall in the first round of the 2011 CFL Draft by the Calgary Stampeders after Calgary traded up to be in a position to draft him. He was later signed to a contract with the Stampeders on May 20, 2011. He earned a spot on the active roster and dressed in his first game on July 1, 2011 against the Toronto Argonauts. Parker recorded his first reception on August 6, 2011 against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. He also recorded his first interception against the BC Lions on September 17, 2011 while on special teams defending a fake-punt play. His first touchdown came two years later after he caught a pass from Bo Levi Mitchell on July 26, 2013 against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He won his first Grey Cup championship game in 2014 as a member of the Stampeders' winning team. Overall, he played in 108 games for the Stampeders until he was released following 2018 training camp on June 10, 2018. Over his career with Calgary, he recorded 178 catches for 2245 receiving yards and 15 receiving touchdowns, 35 carries for 326 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown, 13 punt returns for 121 yards, 21 kickoff returns for 425 yards, and nine special teams tackles.


=== BC Lions ===
On September 1, 2018, Parker signed with the BC Lions to their practice roster and was added to the active roster on September 6, 2018. In 9 games, Parker caught 7 passes for 99 yards, and was also used as a returner; in week 18 against Calgary, Parker's 79 yard punt return nearly scored a touchdown against his former team, but came up just short.


=== Edmonton Eskimos ===
Early in free agency for 2019, Parker signed with the Edmonton Eskimos alongside a large number of other players in a remake of the roster. Despite being the leading receiver in Edmonton's first preseason game, Parker suffered a non-contact ruptured Achilles tendon injury early in the second preseason game, and was ruled out for the season.


== Personal life ==
Parker was born to Anthony and Pamela, while his father was playing for the BC Lions (1986-1989). His father played for the Calgary Stampeders in 1990 and he was raised in Alberta. His uncle, Andy Jonassen, also played for the Stampeders from 1976 to 1980.

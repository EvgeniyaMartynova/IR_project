Missile turret

A missile turret is a device used to aim missiles towards their targets before launch. Similarly to gun turrets they have been used on warships and vehicles on the ground. In most roles articulated missile launching systems on warships have been replaced by vertical launching systems. Ship-based missile systems often have centralised guidance systems which eliminate the need for targeting sensors on the turrets themselves.

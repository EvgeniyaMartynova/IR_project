Measurable function

In mathematics and in particular measure theory, a measurable function is a function between the underlying sets of two measurable spaces that preserves the structure of the spaces: the preimage of any measurable set is measurable, analogous to the definition that a function between topological spaces is continuous if it preserves the topological structure: the preimage of each open set is open. In real analysis, measurable functions are used in the definition of the Lebesgue integral. In probability theory, a measurable function on a probability space is known as a random variable.

   and 
  
    
      
        (
        Y

          T
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (Y,\mathrm {T} )}
   be measurable spaces, meaning that

The choice of 
  
    
      
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma }
  -algebras in the definition above is sometimes implicit and left up to the context. For example, for 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathbb {R} }}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathbb {C} }}
  , or other topological spaces, the Borel algebra (containing all the open sets) is a common choice. Some authors define measurable functions as exclusively real-valued ones with respect to the Borel algebra.If the values of the function lie in an infinite-dimensional vector space, other non-equivalent definitions of measurability, such as weak measurability and Bochner measurability, exist.


== Notable classes of measurable functions ==
Random variables are by definition measurable functions defined on probability spaces.
If 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        ,
        Σ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )}
   and 
  
    
      
        (
        Y
        ,
        T
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (Y,T)}
   are Borel spaces, a measurable function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        (
        X
        ,
        Σ
        )
        →
        (
        Y
        ,
        T
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:(X,\Sigma )\to (Y,T)}
    is also called a Borel function. Continuous functions are Borel functions but not all Borel functions are continuous. However, a measurable function is nearly a continuous function; see Luzin's theorem.  If a Borel function happens to be a section of some map 
  
    
      
        Y
        
          
            →
            
               
              π
               
            
          
        
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y{\xrightarrow {~\pi ~}}X}
  , it is called a Borel section.
A Lebesgue measurable function is a measurable function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        (

            L
          
        
        )
        →
        (
        
          C
        
        ,
        
          
            
              B
            
          
          
            
              C
            
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:(\mathbb {R} ,{\mathcal {L}})\to (\mathbb {C} ,{\mathcal {B}}_{\mathbb {C} })}
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          
            L
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}
   is the 
  
    
      
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma }
  -algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets, and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              B
            
          
          
            
              C
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{\mathbb {C} }}
   is the Borel algebra on the complex numbers 
  
    
      
        
          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }
  .  Lebesgue measurable functions are of interest in mathematical analysis because they can be integrated. In the case 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        
          R

  , 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is Lebesgue measurable iff 
  
    
      
        {
        f
        >
        α
        }
        =
        {
        x
        ∈
        X
        :
        f
        (
        x
        )
        >
        α
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f>\alpha \}=\{x\in X:f(x)>\alpha \}}
   is measurable for all 
  
    
      
        α
        ∈
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha \in \mathbb {R} }
  . This is also equivalent to any of 
  
    
      
        {
        f
        ≥
        α
        }
        ,
        {
        f
        <
        α
        }
        ,
        {
        f
        ≤
        α
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f\geq \alpha \},\{f<\alpha \},\{f\leq \alpha \}}
   being measurable for all 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  , or the preimage of any open set being measurable. Continuous functions, monotone functions, step functions, semicontinuous functions, Riemann-integrable functions, and functions of bounded variation are all Lebesgue measurable. A function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        
          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {C} }
   is measurable iff the real and imaginary parts are measurable.


== Properties of measurable functions ==
The sum and product of two complex-valued measurable functions are measurable. So is the quotient, so long as there is no division by zero.

  . Indeed, two Lebesgue-measurable functions may be constructed in such a way as to make their composition non-Lebesgue-measurable.
The (pointwise) supremum, infimum, limit superior, and limit inferior of a sequence (viz., countably many) of real-valued measurable functions are all measurable as well.

        Y

   is measurable, where 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   is a metric space (endowed with the Borel algebra). This is not true in general if 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   is non-metrizable. Note that the corresponding statement for continuous functions requires stronger conditions than pointwise convergence, such as uniform convergence.


== Non-measurable functions ==
Real-valued functions encountered in applications tend to be measurable; however, it is not difficult to find non-measurable functions.

So long as there are non-measurable sets in a measure space, there are non-measurable functions from that space.  If 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        ,
        Σ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )}
   is some measurable space and 
  
    
      
        A
        ⊂
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\subset X}
   is a non-measurable set, i.e. if 
  
    
      
        A
        ∉
        Σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\notin \Sigma }
  , then the indicator function 
  
    
      
        
          
            1
          
          
            A
          
        
        :
        (
        X
        ,
        Σ
        )
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {1} _{A}:(X,\Sigma )\to \mathbb {R} }
   is non-measurable (where 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
   is equipped with the Borel algebra as usual), since the preimage of the measurable set 
  
    
      
        {
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{1\}}

  Any non-constant function can be made non-measurable by equipping the domain and range with appropriate 
  
    
      
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma }
  -algebras.  If 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {R} }
   is an arbitrary non-constant, real-valued function, then 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is non-measurable if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is equipped with the trivial 
  
    
      
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma }
  -algebra 
  
    
      
        Σ
        =
        {
        ∅
        ,
        X
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma =\{\emptyset ,X\}}
  , since the preimage of any point in the range is some proper, nonempty subset of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  , and therefore does not lie in 
  
    
      
        Σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma }
  .

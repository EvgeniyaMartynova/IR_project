Helena Doukaina Angelina

Helena Doukaina Angelina (Greek: Ἑλένη Δούκαινα Άγγελίνα, Helene Doukaina Angelina; Serbian: Jelena Duka Anđel) was a Greek noblewoman of Thessaly and Queen-consort of medieval Serbia.
Her parents were John I Doukas of Thessaly and his wife Hypomone (a daughter of the Thessalian Vlach chieftain Taronas). In ca. 1273/76, Helena married Serbian king Stefan Milutin (r. 1282–1321), but Milutin abandoned her in ca. 1283. It is possible that their sons were Kings Stefan Konstantin and Stefan Dečanski. It seems Helena then returned to Greece.

Kamence, Rogaška Slatina

Kamence (pronounced [ˈkaːməntsɛ] or [ˈkaːmɛntsɛ]) is a settlement in the Municipality of Rogaška Slatina in eastern Slovenia, close to the border with Croatia. The area traditionally belonged to the region of Styria. It is now included in the Savinja Statistical Region.


== Name ==
The name of the settlement was changed from Sveta Katarina (literally, 'Saint Catherine') to Kamence (literally, 'small stones') in 1953. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms.

== History ==
Macclesfield was first represented in Parliament after the Reform Act of 1832, from when it had two members of Parliament.  This situation lasted until 1880, when after problems at the general election that year it was decided to declare the election void and suspend the writ of election (so no by-election could take place).
In September 1880 a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate further. A report of March 1881 confirmed the allegations of corruption. As a result, the borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption. The disenfranchisement took effect on 25 June 1885, when the town was transferred to the East Cheshire constituency.
However under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 the Macclesfield constituency was recreated with extended boundaries, as a county division, later in 1885. From the 1885 general election it has elected one MP.
Macclesfield had long been considered to be a safe seat for the Conservative Party, having been held by them since the 1918 general election. Macclesfield itself is evenly split in terms of councillors between the Conservatives and Labour, but the smaller towns and rural villages like Prestbury, Gawsworth and Poynton that make up the bulk of the seat vote primarily for the Conservative Party. After the 2017 general election, however, the constituency is now a target seat for Labour, after they achieved a 7% swing in that election.
In the 2019 local elections, the Conservatives lost every councillor they had in the town of Macclesfield, with Labour making significant gains in areas they had never won before. The Conservatives largely maintained their vote in the villages outside Macclesfield, with the possible exceptions of Bollington and Disley, in which they came third behind Labour and Independent candidates.
During the 2016 EU membership referendum, the constituency voted narrowly to remain in the EU, despite the UK overall voting to leave.  Around 7,000 Maxonians subsequently signed a petition calling for a second referendum although it is estimated that 47% of the Macclesfield electorate voted to leave. 

Long-serving member (1971–2010)Sir Nicholas Winterton who had been the Conservative MP, was first elected at a by-election in 1971 and held the seat until his retirement as an MP on the dissolution of the House of Commons in April 2010. Both Sir Nicholas and his wife Ann, Conservative MP for Congleton from 1983 to 2010, announced that they would not be candidates at the general election. On 17 October 2009 David Rutley was selected as the Conservative candidate by way of an open primary organised by the party and on 6 May 2010 was elected MP with an increased majority.

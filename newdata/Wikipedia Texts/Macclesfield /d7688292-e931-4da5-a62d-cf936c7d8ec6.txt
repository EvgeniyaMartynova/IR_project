== History ==
George Davenport was an English banker who was a director of the South Australian Company in England and together with partners Frederick Luck (quarter share) and Roger Cunliffe (1/8 share) paid £4416 for a special survey of 4416 acres (1619 ha) in South Australia. He sent his eldest son (George) Francis to select the land, arriving in Adelaide in February 1840. After initially considering land near Port Lincoln, Francis selected land on the upper reaches of the River Angas, including what is now the town of Macclesfield. This was the last of the special surveys in the area. The town of Macclesfield was named after the Earl of Macclesfield, to whom George Davenport was a steward in England. Francis Davenport returned to England in 1841, leaving Henry Giles to manage his affairs.Francis Davenport and his wife Sarah returned in February 1843 along with Samuel Davenport, his wife Margaret (married 1 June 1842) and their other brother Robert Davenport. Francis died on 8 April 1843 (probably of typhus); later Samuel and Margaret moved to Beaumont and Robert lived at Battunga near Macclesfield and managed the survey.
The first hotel, The Goat's Head Inn, was established in 1841. It was later known as the Macclesfield Arms, Davenport Arms, and now Three Brothers' Arms after the three Davenport brothers. The brewery next door to the hotel was opened by 1851, but converted to a butter and cheese factory around 1903 and abandoned in favour of a new factory in 1937.Macclesfield has been served by a primary school since 1876. In 2010, the Macclesfield Primary School celebrated 150 years of education in the town and surrounding districts. The ceremony was attended by many, including Alexander Downer MP, who lived in Macclesfield in the 1980s with his wife and children. 
The town is also home to the Macclesfield Football Club and Macclesfield Basketball Club.

Helvetia (band)

Helvetia is an independent and experimental alternative music group from Seattle, Washington. Jason Albertini started Helvetia after the dissolution of the band Duster (in which he played drums). Helvetia's first record, The Clever North Wind (2006), was released on The Static Cult Label and distributed by Up Records. Their first national exposure was achieved by touring with Built To Spill. Helvetia is produced/performed by Jason Albertini and sustained by a rotating live line-up, which has included C. Dove Amber, Jim Roth, Scott Plouf, Zeke Howard, and Samantha Stidham. Their third release, Headless Machine of the Heart (2008) was recorded entirely on a 4-track tape machine. Helvetia continues to release music through The Static Cult Label (which is helmed by Duster-mate Clay Parton). In 2012 Helvetia released the full-length album Nothing in Rambling on Joyful Noise Recordings. Helvetia released their new full-length album "Dromomania" on Joyful Noise Recordings on October 2, 2015. The name Helvetia is the female personification of Switzerland, the childhood home of Jason Albertini.

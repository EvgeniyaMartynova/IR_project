Big Stick (band)

Big Stick is an eclectic alternative/independent duo that achieved domestic and foreign cult status with their rock-punk-pop debut release, the Drag Racing EP in 1986. It was instantly recognizable for Yanna Trance's catchy voice repeatedly speaking the line "In the summer I wear my tube top, and Eddie takes me to the dragstrip" throughout the track.  It was one of the 142 singles in BBC DJ John Peel's Record Box that he'd picked to leave behind in case of a fire.In 1990, Blast First records released a box set of 10 7" singles by various artists on their roster, including Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., Big Black, the Butthole Surfers and Sun Ra. The box set was named after the Big Stick track it contained, Devil's Jukebox.
While the band stayed together and more recently have performed with My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, it is still for Drag Racing that they are best known. They have also collaborated on a film soundtrack, for Besotted.

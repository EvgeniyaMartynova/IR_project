Buckling (fish)

A buckling is a form of hot-smoked herring similar to the kipper and the bloater. The head and guts are removed but the roe or milt remain. They may be eaten hot or cold.


== Origin ==
The word may come from the German Bückling or the Swedish böckling, both words denoting a hot-smoked variety of the kipper.


== Bucklings, bloaters and kippers ==
Buckling is hot-smoked whole; bloaters are cold-smoked whole; kippers are split and gutted, and then cold-smoked.

== History ==
The Red Sox Manawatu history is a complicated one. The club having been formed by the gradual merger and name-changes of a multitude of teams from the Palmerston North area. The oldest of these clubs was Saint Andrew's, which was founded in the 1920s. St Andrew's joined forces with Palmerston City (formed in 1938 as Palmerston North Thistle) in 1971, continuing as Palmerston City until 1974, when the club changed its name to Manawatu United. This club became Manawatu AFC in 1992 upon its merger with Rose City – a club which had itself been formed via a merge. Manawatu AFC combined with Riverside Red Sox (a team formed from the 1998 merger of Riverside and Red Sox) in 2004.
Rose City had itself formed from the 1983 merger of Glen Carron and Kiwi United. Glen Carron had previously been known as Corinthian-Old Boys, a club founded in 1963 from the merger of Corinthians and Palmerston North Old Boys, the latter club having started its life as New Settlers FC in 1952.

Gomal River's headwaters are located south-east of Ghazni. The springs which form the headwaters of the Gomal's main branch emerge above the fort at Babakarkol in Katawaz, a district inhabited by Ghilji Pashtuns from the Kharoti and Sulaimankhel clans, in Paktika Province. The Gomal's other branch, the "Second Gomal", joins the main channel about 14 miles below its source. The Gomal flows southeast through eastern Ghilji country before entering Pakistan.Within Pakistan, the Gomal River forms the boundary between Balochistan and the South Waziristan Agency (formerly part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but now part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). After approximately 110 miles from its source, it merges with the Zhob River, its major tributary, near Khajuri Kach.It is about 100 miles from the Zhob River to the Indus River. From South Waziristan, the river enters the Gomal Valley in the district of Tank, Pakistan at a place known as Girdavi, Murtuza which is inhabited by the Miani tribe. It is mainly here that the water of Gomal is used to cultivate the lands in Gomal Valley through Zam System (Rod Kohi). The river passes then through the Damaan plain in Kulachi Tehsil and later on through Dera Ismail Khan Tehsil, It then joins the Indus River 20 miles south of Dera Ismail Khan.

So This Is Love? (song)

"So This Is Love?" is a rock song written by the group Van Halen for their 1981 album Fair Warning. It is one of four singles issued for the album. It peaked at #110 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #15 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.
The solo for this song was allegedly a combination of four short solos Eddie had previously written, and combined them all to make the final recorded solo. During the band's 2007-2008 reunion tour, Wolfgang Van Halen had a small solo spot during the intro of this song.

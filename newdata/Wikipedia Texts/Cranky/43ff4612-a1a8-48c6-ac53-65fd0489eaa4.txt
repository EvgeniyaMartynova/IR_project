Cranky Kong

This page lists the major characters from the Donkey Kong franchise. For minor characters, most of whom are exclusive to single games, please refer to external uwikis dedicated to the franchise.


== Kongs ==
Kongs are a race of apes that live on the Donkey Kong Island.
The Kong Family (also known as the Kong Klan and the DK Crew) is a group led by Donkey Kong comprising his family and friends. They have numerous non-Kong allies who appear throughout the series, and are commonly antagonized by the Kremling Krew, who steal their valuables (and sometimes kidnap members of the Kong Family) to further their nefarious goals.


=== Donkey Kong ===

Donkey Kong, also known as DK or D. Kong, is a male gorilla, the main protagonist of the Donkey Kong franchise and the leader of the DK crew. Donkey Kong first appears in the arcade game Donkey Kong, however, the modern incarnation of the character introduced in Donkey Kong Country is revealed to be the grandson of the arcade original character.


=== Donkey Kong Jr. ===

Donkey Kong Jr., also known as DK Jr. or simply Junior, is the protagonist of the 1982 arcade game of the same name and the son of the original Donkey Kong. Junior wears a white singlet with a red letter "J" on it. His objective in the game is to save his father, who was locked by Mario in a cage. He returns in the 1994 Game Boy video game Donkey Kong, where he teams up with his father, who has kidnapped Pauline, against Mario. Junior also appeared as a playable character in Super Mario Kart, but he didn't return in any of the future installments, he also appeared in the Virtual Boy game Mario's Tennis, and as a hidden character in the Nintendo 64 version of the similarly named Mario Tennis. He also has his own educational video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System: Donkey Kong Jr. Math. Other appearances by Junior includes the Game & Watch games Donkey Kong Jr. (in wide-screen, tabletop and panorama versions) and Donkey Kong II, as well as the Game & Watch Gallery series compilations for Game Boy. He also appears as the physical appearance of the transformed king of World 4 in the Super NES and Game Boy Advance versions of Super Mario Bros. 3. Donkey Kong Junior had his own segment in the first season of Saturday Supercade and was voiced by Frank Welker. Like his father, he had his own cereal brand in the 1980s.
According to Rare, the developers of Donkey Kong Country, there are multiple Donkey Kongs, shortly before the release of Donkey Kong 64 in 1999, Leigh Loveday claimed that "as far as he knew", the modern one who appears in Donkey Kong Country onward is theoretically a grown-up version of Junior himself. However, the Donkey Kong Country manual, Donkey Kong Land, Donkey Kong Country 2, stated that Cranky the original Donkey Kong is the grandfather of the game's titular character. More recently, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Donkey Kong Country Returns, and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze have stated that the current Donkey Kong is the original Donkey Kong's grandson implying that Junior is actually the current Donkey Kong's father.The character Diddy Kong was going to be an updated version of Donkey Kong Junior. However, Nintendo did not like this idea, suggesting either to give him his old look or make him a new character. Rare chose the latter and Diddy Kong was made.


=== Diddy Kong ===

Diddy Kong, also known as Diddy, is a young male monkey, the secondary main protagonist of the Donkey Kong franchise and Donkey Kong's sidekick. His first appearance was Donkey Kong Country. In the game's storyline, Donkey Kong requested for him to protect their Banana Hoard overnight, while he takes a nap. While guarding the bananas, Diddy was captured by the Kremlings and sealed afterwards. When Donkey Kong heard the news, he set off on his adventure, freed Diddy, and they both confronted King K. Rool. The duo managed to defeat him, and recover their stolen bananas along the way.
In Donkey Kong Country 2, Donkey Kong gets kidnapped by Kaptain K. Rool, and Diddy must team up with Dixie Kong to save him. After rescuing DK and defeating K. Rool, he retreats to his secret island, the Lost World. The Kongs defeat K. Rool a second time, and he gets stuck in Crocodile Isle's generator, which explodes. The Kongs escaped the island and witnessed its destruction.
Later on, both Diddy and DK get kidnapped in Donkey Kong Country 3, and the newly named Baron K. Roolenstein uses them as a power source for KAOS, a giant robot to spy on Dixie and Kiddy Kong's adventure in rescuing the apes. Diddy and Donkey Kong are eventually freed by Dixie and Kiddy.
Years after his defeat, King K. Rool returns in Donkey Kong 64; he gets his minions to imprison Donkey Kong's friends, with Diddy being one of them. He attempts to steal the Banana Hoard again. As soon as Diddy is freed from his imprisonment, he can collect red bananas, red coins, play his electric guitar, charge at foes or objects, fly in his barrel jet pack, and shoot peanuts from his guns.
Diddy Kong also appeared in Donkey Kong Country Returns, its 3DS remake and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. He is one of the main characters of the television series adaption. He has a lot of roles in the Mario games, including basketball, kart racing and more.


=== Cranky Kong ===
Cranky Kong is an elderly grumpy gorilla, known for his scathing, fourth wall-breaking commentary. Introduced in Donkey Kong Country, he has appeared in a number of Donkey Kong games, primarily as a reluctant adviser to Donkey Kong and his various simian pals (in game and in the instruction manuals), as well as running minigames and tutorials. He is currently voiced by Takashi Nagasako.The Donkey Kong Country instruction manual states that Cranky is the original Donkey Kong character featured in the 1981 arcade game.The current Donkey Kong (introduced in Donkey Kong Country) was initially described as his grandson, making him Donkey Kong III. However, in Donkey Kong 64, Cranky directly refers to the current Donkey Kong as his son in their first conversation. This was reverted to the original grandson relationship in subsequent games such as the Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country and Donkey Kong Country 2, Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Donkey Kong Country Returns.
As his name implies, Cranky is perpetually bitter about many things and complains about them to anyone who gives him even the slightest acknowledgment. He is mostly angry about the state of modern video games, once going so far as to complain about how many bits and bytes are used up to simply animate his swinging beard. Every time he sees any such thing he seems to fondly recall his heyday in which he was an 8-bit character with only three frames of animation.
In Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Cranky's main purpose was to distribute helpful hints about the game's many stages to Donkey Kong and his sidekick Diddy Kong whenever they dropped by his cabin. Donkey Kong Country 2 saw him play a similar role, although this time the player would have to provide enough banana coins to buy specific hints. In Donkey Kong Country 3 he was the player's opponent in a throwing mini game at Swanky's Sideshow; in the Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country 2 and Donkey Kong Country 3, he hosted several minigames, and was briefly playable in one of them.
Donkey Kong 64 saw Cranky deal out potions that granted each of the five playable Kongs special abilities and could be purchased at Cranky's Lab. He also hosted the Jetpac game, and would let one to play it after earning 15 Banana Medals. Achieving 5,000 points in Jetpac earns the Rareware Coin, which was required to beat the game.
Cranky also made cameo appearances in Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the Jungle Japes stage, as well as appearing in Donkey Konga and its sequels. His most recent appearances have been dispensing tips in DK King of Swing and DK Jungle Climber, in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast where he served as a fully playable character for the first time (aside from the Dojo minigame of Donkey Kong Country 3's Game Boy Advance port), and in Donkey Kong Country Returns and its 3DS remake, where he runs various shops that sell items and helps the player by giving hints and tips when they leave his shop.
In Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Cranky becomes a playable character for the first time in a Donkey Kong platformer. His moveset is based around his cane.
Cranky was a regular on the Donkey Kong Country animated series. He was still as senile as in the games, but without his fourth wall-breaking comments. His cabin was where the Crystal Coconut, the mystical bauble that made DK the future ruler of Kongo Bongo Island (as DK Island was called on the show), was kept. Often, Cranky mixed potions, somewhat prefiguring his Donkey Kong 64 role. He was voiced by Aron Tager, and by RyÅ«sei Nakao in the Japanese dub of the TV series.


=== Funky Kong ===
Funky Kong is a gorilla who usually supplies services to the Kongs such as allowing them to go back to worlds they have previously completed in the game. However, in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, he took on a different role as a vehicle merchant, allowing Dixie Kong and Kiddy Kong to reach new areas of the game world. In Donkey Kong 64, Funky switched jobs yet again to become the ammunitions expert of the group, and his business seemed to suggest an army surplus store. He supplied various weapons and upgrades to the Kongs, and donned camouflage clothing, goggles and a large rocket on his back (which is revealed near the end of the game to contain a giant boot) in favor of his old board shorts and sunglasses. He took back on his "surfer" appearance in later games. He is also a playable character in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, as well as in multiplayer modes of DK King of Swing and DK Jungle Climber. He is currently voiced by Toshihide Tsuchiya.Funky was also a regular on the Donkey Kong Country cartoon, where he was voiced by Damon D'Oliveira. One difference is that the cartoon version of Funky had tan fur as opposed to the brown fur his video game counterpart had. He was also given a Jamaican accent. However, like his game counterpart, Funky is keen on surfing (he can be seen surfing in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest), and like in the first game, he runs his own airline service. He often talks about karma and is the best dancer on the island. Funky is obviously not fond of adventuring or fighting the Kremlings, nor is he keen on doing very much work; he often tries to take the easier way out of a situation, or just leave it up to DK and Diddy.
Funky also appears as an unlockable heavyweight character in Mario Kart Wii, his first appearance in a Mario game.
His next appearance in a Mario game was in Mario Super Sluggers for the Wii, where he was a playable character along with the other Donkey Kong characters. Funky uses his surfboard as a bat in the game.
Funky resurfaces in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze as the keeper of the Fly and Buy shops, thus taking over the role of shopkeeper from Cranky Kong, who instead becomes a playable character. In the Nintendo Switch enhanced port of Tropical Freeze, Funky also serves as a playable character, headlining the eponymous "Funky Mode" exclusive to that port. In Funky Mode, characters can play as Funky Kong, who has extra health and other perks such as double-jumping or standing on spikes without taking damage. Players can still switch back to traditional Donkey Kong and back to Funky again while playing in Funky Mode if they wish, but Donkey Kong and his partner will both have added health. A save file cannot be changed out of Funky Mode once it has been started.


=== Candy Kong ===
Candy Kong is a female gorilla and Donkey Kong's girlfriend who performs various services for the Kongs throughout the different games. Candy Kong first appeared in Donkey Kong Country providing save point stations throughout the game. Her second appearance was in Donkey Kong 64; in this game, she provided instruments for DK and company to use against the Kremlings and gives the Kong family more watermelons which increase the player's life. She wore headphones, a pink short-sleeve top, pink short shorts, and some footwear. She also makes a brief appearance in DK King of Swing, and is seen cheering on the player's characters. She wore a pink bikini top and short shorts, and her torso was redesigned (this appearance has remained in subsequent games). She also makes a brief cameo appearance in the GBA remake of Donkey Kong Country 2 and Donkey Kong Country 3. She is currently voiced by Satsuki Tsuzumi.In the Game Boy Advance remake of Donkey Kong Country 2 she appears as a model on Swanky Kong's quiz show, and she wore a purple dress.
She also made a brief appearance in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast in the mode Candy's Challenges and allowed the players to collect up to a total of 1,000 bananas and to win the tracks in first place. She, along with Swanky Kong are the only two Kongs who have yet to become playable. She was going to be one of the playable characters in Diddy Kong Pilot, but that game became cancelled after Microsoft Game Studios bought Rare from Nintendo.
Candy was also a regular on the Donkey Kong Country animated series as well. She was voiced by Joy Tanner. However, in the series, she looked completely different from the pink-clad blonde seen in the games. Also, on the show, she worked at the barrel factory run by Bluster Kong, her boss. This version of Candy also showed off a very quick temper.
In 2007, Games.net ranked Candy Kong #2 on their list of "Top Ten Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters".


=== Dixie Kong ===
Dixie Kong is a young female monkey  with a prehensile ponytail. She is Diddy Kong's girlfriend.

She gave the player advice and allowed the player to save his or her game. She appeared again in Donkey Kong Land 2, and again in Donkey Kong Country 3. This time, she resided in Wrinkly's Save Cave, where the player could both save their game and deposit Banana Birds, which were found throughout the game. This concept remained sans birds in Donkey Kong Land III, where she resided in Wrinkly's Refuge. In the Game Boy Advance version of Donkey Kong Country 3, Wrinkly was portrayed as a spiritual follower of the Banana Birds. She is currently voiced by Miho Yamada.Wrinkly next appeared in Donkey Kong 64. She had apparently died at some point after Donkey Kong Country 3 as she is now a ghost. Every world lobby in the game, with the exception of Hideout Helm, featured five doors with Wrinkly's face on them; each door presented a hint for the level that applied to the Kong that corresponded to the door color (yellow for Donkey Kong, red for Diddy Kong, blue for Lanky Kong, purple for Tiny Kong, and green for Chunky Kong). When the player begins meeting her in Donkey Kong 64, she says, "Don't be afraid of me, young ones! It's only me, Wrinkly Kong," and then she gives the player advice on how to win a Golden Banana on the corresponding level.

Several machines and ghosts seem to be included in the Kremling Krew as well. Many of these enemies also appeared in Donkey Kong 64 and are playable in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast.
While almost all the Kremlings are enemies of the Kongs, one exception is K. Lumsy, who opens up levels for the Kongs in Donkey Kong 64.
The Kremlings were originally conceived for a game called Jonny Blastoff and the Kremling Armada, an unreleased point & click adventure game that predated Donkey Kong Country.


=== King K. Rool ===

King K. Rool is a hot-tempered, temperamental, aggressive, and baleful green Kremling who was the main antagonist of many Donkey Kong games and has been Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong's archenemy ever since his creation during the era of Rare development. The despotic king of Kremlings and master of Kremling Krew, he constantly antagonizes the Kongs, referring to them as "filthy apes," "monkey brains," and "ludicrous lemurs" as well as frequently robbing Donkey Kong's banana hoard. His most distinguishing features are the tic in his left eye, his red cape, his gold crown and wrist bands, and his yellow belly (originally a piece of golden armor) with an outie navel, his tail seems to change size or disappear completely between appearances. While overweight, K. Rool has huge muscles in his arms and he has proven to have enormous brute strength that matches (perhaps surpasses) both Donkey Kong and Chunky Kong in power.
While K. Rool's crown-and-cape look has been his default appearance since Donkey Kong Country, he takes on alternate disguises and personalities to battle the Kongs in other games.

He is the pirate Kaptain K. Rool who kidnaps Donkey Kong and imprisoned him in Diddy's Kong Quest.

He becomes King "Krusha" K. Rool  in Donkey Kong 64. This game also features Gloomy Galleon, which features a sunken ship bearing pictures of his previous alias, Kaptain K. Rool. It is unknown whether or not this is the ship in Donkey Kong Country 2.In the TV series, he appears as a king and often feuds with Kaptain Skurvy (who is based on the Kremling enemy Kannon). Besides the Kritters and Klap Traps, King K. Rool's henchmen are Klump and Krusha. He is portrayed as somewhat pompous with a stereotypical English dialect.
He was voiced by Chris Sutherland in Donkey Kong 64, Benedict Campbell in the Donkey Kong Country TV show, JÅ«rÅta Kosugi in the Japanese adaptation of the show, and currently by Toshihide Tsuchiya in the video games. His name is a pun on the word cruel.
K. Rool also appeared in Mario Super Sluggers (his first appearance in a Mario game) as an unlockable character along with Donkey, Diddy, and Funky Kong as well as one of his Kritters. He uses his magical staff as a bat. A Mii Fighter costume based on K. Rool's design appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U as downloadable content, and as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

As with most of the Kremlings in Diddy's Kong Quest, Kritters were dressed as pirates and are outfitted with peglegs. Those who walk are named Klomp and have one peg, while the jumpers are named Kaboing and have two. The Kritters in "Dixie Kong's Double Trouble" appear to be genetically altered, the walkers named Kobble have extra muscles added, while the jumpers named Re-Koil actually bounce on their spring-loaded tails.
A single leather jacket wearing kritter known as Krunch appears as a playable character in Diddy Kong Racing. 
In Donkey Kong 64, Kritters are redesigned and appear sporting similar leather jackets to Krunch, as well as belt buckles with skulls on them. Two specific Kritters are seen piloting K.Rool's Mechanical Island, chasing after one of the Kongs, and serving as referees during the final battle. Krashes also reappeared in Donkey Kong 64, however they were redesigned to be much more muscular, as well as wield clubs to smack the Kongs with. Skeletal and robotic variants of Kritters also appear in DK64.
In DK: King of Swing, Kritters appear as enemies in the main game mode and as a playable character in the game's multiplayer mode. King of Swing would mark the debut of their current muscular design. Kritters appear mostly unchanged in the game's sequel, DK: Jungle Climber. A single Kritter appears as racer in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, sharing the same balanced stats as his rival Donkey Kong.
They would make their Mario franchise debut as spectators in Mario Power Tennis. In the Mario Strikers series, a Kritter serves as a goalie for each team. A Robo-Kritter serves as the goalie for a robotic team in Super Mario Strikers. In Mario Super Sluggers, Kritters appear as playable characters and members of the DK Wilds team.
Kritters appeared as trophies in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, as well as stickers in Brawl. They also appeared as enemies in the 3DS exclusive Smash Run mode, with Green Kritters attacking by biting three times in a row, while Blue Kritters attack by spinning around furiously with their claws.
They also appear in the Donkey Kong Country TV series as King K. Rool's henchmen. A recurring French accented Kritter by the name of Green Kroc appears in the TV series as one of Kaptain Skurvy's shipmates and is voiced by Len Carlson.

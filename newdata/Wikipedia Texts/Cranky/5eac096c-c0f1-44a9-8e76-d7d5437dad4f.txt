He carried a poster on his side telling people to "JOIN THE ANTI-RAIL LEAGUE". His favourite phrase is "Free the roads!" He also wears a large sign saying "THE RAILWAY BUS," although he isn't really.
When he first arrived, he tried to steal Duck's and Oliver's passengers by pretending to be a railway bus. Bulgy was determined to get the passengers to the Big Station before Duck, but was stopped when he became stuck under a low bridge after taking a short cut. Eventually he was turned into a henhouse by Duck's branch line, but was given a second chance in series 7. However, after the hens caused trouble for him when he was delivering passengers, he decided to work as a vegetable bus, which he is much happier than ever before. He was later repainted back to red and works as a bus again. He still appears to be against railways.

Pull 'em up! Turn 'em into roads!". He rarely comes out on top, as his enthusiasm for beating the railways can make him careless. On one occasion, he obstructed Duck's way, causing Gordon to smash through one of Duck's trucks, destroying it. As a punishment, the Fat Controller removed George from rolling duties and sent him to the timber yard to saw wood for a week.

== Sodor Construction Company ==
In series 6, a new set of characters was introduced called "The Pack". This is a gang of construction machines owned by Miss Jenny Packard & Co. The characters were devised by then-producer Phil Fehrle with the intention of being turned into a spin-off series, possibly as a rival to Hit-Entertainment's other successful show and brand Bob the Builder.
This spin-off series never materialised, and prior to 2006, The Pack appeared in the episodes "Jack Jumps In" and "A Friend In Need". They have been featured with four new characters in a DVD entitled On Site with Thomas. In The Great Discovery, almost all of The Pack are seen. The exceptions are Nelson, Patrick, Isabella and Byron. Jack, Alfie and either Max or Monty also appeared in the series 12 episode, "Percy and the Bandstand".
Jack is currently one of five members of the Pack to appear in the CGI series, thus appearing in the 2013 film special, King of the Railway. However, Jack also appeared with a new look to his face. It was formerly round, but since King of the Railway it has been square.
Also, Alfie, Oliver, Max and Monty (the other four members of the Pack to appear in the CGI series), returned in the 2015 film special, Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure.
Brenda and Darcy, (two new members of The Pack) will be introduced in Series 23.

Oliver is also capable of switching between different tools, including a chisel and wrecking ball. He is polite to the other members of the Pack.
He should not be confused with the steam engine, Oliver. However, Marion once made this mistake when she met him for the first time. She believed the Arlesdale Railway engines turned him from a steam engine to a digger. It was the line's opening ceremony that she found there were 2 Olivers on Sodor.
Oliver first appeared in series 6, and had also appeared in series 20, 21 and 23. He also appears in The Great Discovery. He had a supporting role in Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure. Thomas imagined himself having Oliver's wheels in  The Great Race.

They are known to cause trouble for the Pack Members and also the engines; but are sternly scolded by Miss Jenny when they are found out! Despite being unruly at times with dangerous stunts, they have a good side in them somewhere  and still do the work like everyone else. They are painted red and grey and have the numbers 15 and 16 respectively. Max has a thick front bumper, while Monty has a "two pipe-type" front bumper.
Max first appeared in series 6 (with Monty first appearing in the mini-series, thereafter), and have also appeared in series 12, 20, 21, 23 and The Great Discovery.

Voice Actors

=== Byron ===
Byron is a boisterous yellow bulldozer with a big blade. He is a bit conceited, but likes to be useful like the rest of the Pack. He has the number 18 painted on his sides. He always likes to make sure the site is leveled which can sometimes cause trouble. 
Voice Actors

Ryōichi Tanaka (Japan, Season 6 only)


=== Ned ===
Ned is an old light brown and tan steam shovel. He means well, but he can sometimes be clumsy. Indeed, he once nearly caused a terrible accident by knocking out the keystone of a railway bridge when Thomas was due to cross with a goods train in "A friend in need". But apart from the minor bumps and accidents, Ned's heart is as big as his bucket and he is a valued member of the Pack. He has the number 19 painted on his cab as well as 'Packard and Co.', but later changed to "Sodor Construction Company" on "On Site with Thomas".
Voice Actors

Yasuhiro Takato (Japan, Season 6 only)


=== Isobella ===
Isobella is a vintage lorry who looks almost identical to Elizabeth, apart from her bright yellow paintwork and her flatbed. She is a hard worker, but does not like getting dirty. She is painted yellow with red lining and she has the number 22 painted on her sides in red. She is the second steam lorry on the island of Sodor.
Despite many misconceptions of her name being spelt "Isabella", official material proves that her name is correctly spelt as "Isobella".Voice Actors

Yuka Shioyama (Japan, Season 6 only)


=== Patrick ===
Patrick is a concrete transport truck. He was found to be quite a boastful soul in his first appearance.  He knows all there is to know about cement and thinks it is one of the essential means of keeping the building site running. He is painted maroon with cream bits. He has the number 23.


=== Buster ===
Buster is a simple red-brown steamroller who goes about his job with glee and pride knowing all is right with the world. What Buster lacks in imagination, he makes up for in heart, commitment and hard work and is liked by all the machines in the yard (except perhaps Max and Monty). He is the only member of the Pack not to wear a number.


=== Nelson ===
Nelson is an intelligent Ballast tractor whose job is to haul construction workers and the Pack to and from work. As the bearer of such weighty loads, he often feels overworked, but will never complain. He is proud of his paint job and is happiest when he looks his best. He wears the number 10 and is painted black with cream lining, red alloys and beam.
The website of series art director Robert Gauld-Galliers features a sketch of a thirteenth Pack character, Nigel, a green-and-gold transporter who wears the number 21. Because of the similarity in name and prototype, it is possible that Nigel is the character who eventually became Nelson.

Sir Topham Hatt goes almost everywhere in it. He has had a few accidents while driving it, namely, popping one of its tyres in a pothole, and sliding into a ditch, a haystack, and a pond. In the Season 11 story Thomas and the Runaway Car, Thomas collected the "New" Car that looks identical to the "Old" Car. Whether or not this is a new one or merely the old one is currently unknown. It is painted "Hatt Blue".


=== Tom Tipper's Mail Van ===
Tom Tipper the Postman goes everywhere in his mail van, as shown in the Season 4 story "Mind That Bike". When his boss decides it is too expensive to run, Tom is forced to use his bike, until Percy accidentally ruins it by pulling out while it was propped up against his train. The next day when Percy comes to the station, Tom has a brand new van because of the accident. Both vans are painted red with "Sodor Mail" on the sides in white.


=== Miss Jenny's Land Rover ===
Miss Jenny Packard of the Sodor Construction Company uses a Land Rover as her primary mode of transportation to the construction sights. The car appears only in the spinoff "Jack and The Pack". It has a blue and cream paint job.

== History ==

The lido was opened on 20 August 1938. The lido was designed by Harry Rowbotham and TL Smithson (London County Council Parks Department) and is nearly identical in design to Victoria Park Lido and Brockwell Park Lido. There was a diving stage, shutes and a café, with areas for sunbathing and spectators.Costing £34,000 to construct, this was the most expensive of London County Council's 13 lidos built in the 1920–39 period.
In 1976, after the death of a 15-year-old boy, further safety measures were taken, including removing most of the diving facilities and increasing staff. The last diving board was removed in 2003.
Refurbishments after the late 1980s included hot showers, cycle racks, paddling pool and CCTV. In 1986 the lido was taken over by the London Residuary Body and in 1989 by the Corporation of London.
The lido was Grade II Listed in January 1999.49,000 visitors were recorded in 2003.
In 2005, the custom for free swimming before 9.30am was dropped and a £2 entry fee introduced. Refurbishment in 2005 included a stainless steel pool lining, the first of its kind for an outdoor pool in Britain.

Hendecourt-lès-Ransart

Hendecourt-lès-Ransart is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France.


== Geography ==
A small farming village situated 7 miles (11 km) south of Arras, on the D4 road.


== History ==
The etymology of the name begins as ‘’’Hetnanicurtis’’, the small area (curtis) belonging to someone by the name of Hetna, in the Merovingian time. The name has changed over the years: Hendecourdelle (1300); Hendecourdel (1300, 1380, 1450, 1457, 1552, 1556, 1574, 1578); Hendecordel (1338, 1400); Hennecourt (1500); Hendecorde (1565); Hennnecordel (1723); Hendecourt (1804); Hendecourt-Lez-Ransart in the 19th century and finally Hendecourt-Les-Ransart.  
The first chateau was probably built around 1703 by Louis-Joseph Le Sergeant of Hendecourt on the site of an earlier manor house. The chateau and its farm were sold in 1878 to the Diesbach de Belleroche family from Fribourg Switzerland, who still own it today. The entire village and chateau were completely destroyed between 1914-1918 then rebuilt.
The old flour mill was dismantled in 1912.

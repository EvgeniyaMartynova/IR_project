Otto and Ada decide to try and patch up their marriage, so she returns home. But the theatre keeps drawing Ada and after a short time she leaves for the second time. Elise puts Otto back on his feet again and the two choose to live together. When Ada does not respond to his request for divorce, Otto arranges a false death certificate. Otto and Elise get married, are happy and have a son. Until Ada suddenly returns and accuses Otto of bigamy. In court, Ada is deeply impressed by Elise and Otto's son. She takes some poison and dies on the spot. The Engel family can live on in peace.

Purga-class icebreaker

The Purga class, Russian designation Project 22120 Purga (blizzard), is a series of ice-strengthened patrol ships designed by Petrobalt Design Bureau and being built by Almaz for the Russian Coast Guard. Project 22120 is a new generation border patrol vessel with an icebreaking capability, allowing it independent navigation in areas with ice thickness up to 0.6 m during winter-spring and up to 0.8 m during summer-autumn season. The class is intended for operations in waters near Sakhalin, Russia's largest island.

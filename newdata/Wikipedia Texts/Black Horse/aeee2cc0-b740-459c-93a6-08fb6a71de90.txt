Black Horse (Comanche)

Black Horse or Tu-ukumah (unknownâ€“circa  1900), was a Comanche war chief. After Bull Bear died in 1874, Black Horse was promoted to second chief in the Quahadi band of Comanche.
He surrendered to the United States Army at Fort Sill, Indian Territory, at the end of the Red River War in early 1875. He was then sent along with 10 other Comanche to Fort Marion in St. Augustine, Florida. His wife and daughter Akhah were allowed to join him, although they were not considered prisoners. He was released from captivity and returned to the Comanche reservation in Indian Territory in 1878.
Quanah Parker was only made Chief by the United States Army, because Comanches did not want a Chief after captivity

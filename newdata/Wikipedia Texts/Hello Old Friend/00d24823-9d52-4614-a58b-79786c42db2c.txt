Hello Old Friend (James Taylor song)

Walking Man is the fifth studio album by singer-songwriter James Taylor. Released in June 1974, it was not as successful as his previous efforts, only reaching #13 on the Billboard Album Chart and only selling 300,000 copies in the USA. Until 2008's Covers, it was the only studio album he released that never received a certification as a gold or platinum record from the RIAA. The song "Walking Man", released as the album's first single, failed to place on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at all, but nevertheless, stands today as an often reprised fan favorite.
"Hello Old Friend" was used in the intro for ABC's Game 3 coverage of the 1989 World Series, just before the pre-game broadcast was interrupted by a 6.9 magnitude earthquake.

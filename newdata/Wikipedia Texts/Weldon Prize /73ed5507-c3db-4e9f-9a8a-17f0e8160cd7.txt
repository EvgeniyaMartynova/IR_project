Weldon Memorial Prize and Medal

The Weldon Memorial Prize, also known as the Weldon Memorial Prize and Medal, is given yearly by the University of Oxford.  The prize is to be awarded

without regard to nationality or membership of any University to the person who, in the judgement of the electors, has, in the ten years next preceding the date of the award, published the most noteworthy contribution to the development of mathematical or statistical methods applied to problems in Biology. (Biology shall, for the purposes of this clause, be interpreted as including Zoology, Botany, Anthropology, Sociology, Psychology, and Medical Science.)
It is named in honor of Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, former Linacre Professor of Zoology at the University.  It was established through the efforts of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson. Although intended to be given yearly, it has in the past been given less often.

Thee Attacks

Thee Attacks was a rock band hailing from Aalborg in the Northern part of Denmark who since relocated to Copenhagen. Terry, Johnny and Jimmy were the founding members and in 2008 Ritchie joined.
Thee Attacks gained a significant reputation with the raw energy they expressed through their live shows. Grammy Award-winning producer Liam Watson has produced their debut album Thats Mister Attack to you in 2010 and has also had his hands on their second album Dirty Sheets released from the Record label Crunchy Frog in 2012.
In 2014, Thee Attacks announced that they had decided to break up due to musical differences.


== Music style ==
The main music feature of Thee Attacks is a mixture of 60s-70s garage, rock'n'roll, proto-punk and classic rock sound which is influenced by such classic bands like The Who, Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground, Led Zeppelin, The Doors and Slade. Together with another relatively new bands which appeared in the last decade and plays the similar music, among Eagles of Death Metal, Black Keys, Blues Explosion, White Stripes and Hives, Thee Attacks takes their own part in growth of this retro-sound.

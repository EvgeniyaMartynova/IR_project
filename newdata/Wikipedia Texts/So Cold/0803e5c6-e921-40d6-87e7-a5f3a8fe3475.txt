== Background and writing ==
In an interview with Guitar World, Aaron Fink and Benjamin Burnley said that the movie 28 Days Later was an inspiration while writing the song because of its feeling of desolation.


== Music video ==
The music video of "So Cold" was directed by Frank Borin. Its story takes place in the 19th century, judging by the style of clothing, and first shows a preacher standing at the edge of a swamp. The scene then shifts to a group of people walking in a forest. One man can be seen carrying a large stone with the Breaking Benjamin Celtic knot on it. The man, who is being punished for infidelity towards his wife, is shackled to the stone throughout the video and struggles to free himself from it. Towards the end, the group of people arrive at the swamp where the preacher stands. The man carrying the stone walks into the swamp and drowns. His wife appears in a black robe while the woman he cheated with wears a white robe.
Meanwhile, the band is seen throughout the video in another part of the forest performing the song.

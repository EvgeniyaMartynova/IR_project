== History ==
The American Stores Tower was originally built as the corporate headquarters for American Stores (owners of Sav-on, Osco, Jewel grocery/pharmacy stores.)  Shortly after completion, the company was acquired by Albertsons on August 3, 1998, and the building became known as the Delta Tower shortly thereafter.  When Albertsons decided to move operations to the Hardware Building on 400 West near North Temple, the building was purchased by Wasatch Property Management, and renamed the building Wells Fargo Center. The building was the headquarters of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) leading up to the 2002 Winter Olympics. Wells Fargo currently occupies numerous floors within the building, as do many of Salt Lake's premiere law firms.

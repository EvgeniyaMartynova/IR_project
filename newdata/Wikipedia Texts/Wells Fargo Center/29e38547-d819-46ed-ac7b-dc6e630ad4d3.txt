== History ==
The Foundation purchased the property from the Christian Life Center in the 1970s for $4.5 million. The facility opened to the public in 1981. Henry Trione, a philanthropist affiliated with Wells Fargo bank, assembled a group of donors, dubbed "Henry's Angels", who purchased the property for $4.5 million cash in a bankruptcy court in 1981. In 2006, the Foundation sold the naming rights to Wells Fargo Bank for ten years, coming into effect on March 12, 2005. The foundation continued to own and operate the center, which reverted to its original name on March 12, 2016. The center's east wing was heavily damaged in the Tubbs fire.


=== Notable performances ===
The venue was the site of the taping of comedian Lewis Black's fourth album, Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues, and the final recorded performance by comedian George Carlin, his 14th HBO special, It's Bad for Ya.

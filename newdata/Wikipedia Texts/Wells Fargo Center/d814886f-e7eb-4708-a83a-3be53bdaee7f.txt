Wells Fargo Center (Miami)

The Wells Fargo Center (previously known as Met 2 Financial Center) is part of the Metropolitan Miami complex in the central business district of Downtown Miami, Florida, United States. It was completed in 2010 and is the eighth tallest building in Miami, as well as the ninth in Florida.
The Wells Fargo Center is adjacent to the JW Marriott Marquis Miami, a 31-story, 367-foot (112 m) building which is occupied by a JW Marriott Hotel building. The two structures are connected to each other via a parking garage.
The Metropolitan Miami project gained attention due to NBA star Shaquille O'Neal's involvement in the project. In 2006, he formed the O'Neal Group, a building-development company. The Metropolitan Miami project was the group's first project.

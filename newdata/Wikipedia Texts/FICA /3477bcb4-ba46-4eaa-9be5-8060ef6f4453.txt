Forum for International Conciliation and Arbitration

The Forum for International Conciliation and Arbitration (FICA) is a non-governmental organisation providing arbitration, dispute-resolution and dispute-avoidance services, founded by Ben Beaumont.

Ben Beaumont was co-opted into the Expert Group of Working Group VI Secured Transactions assisting with the Draft Legislative Guide to the Model Law of Secured Transactions 2005-07.
In 2002 FICA was invited with Observer status to attend UNCITRAL and was accredited to the WTO in 1999 and International Trade Centre (ITC) in 1998.

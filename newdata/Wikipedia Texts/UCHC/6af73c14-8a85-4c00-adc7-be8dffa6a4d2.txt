United Collegiate Hockey Conference

The United Collegiate Hockey Conference (UCHC) is a college athletic conference which operates in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania in the eastern United States.  It participates in NCAA Division III as a hockey-only conference.
The conference was announced in 2016 as an association of ten schools and league play began for the 2017-18 academic year, with nine each playing in the men's and women's divisions.  The majority of the member schools were previously members of the now-defunct ECAC West hockey conference. Wilkes University was also announced as a future member for both the men's and women's divisions for the start of the 2018–19 academic year. Currently, Nazareth College competes only in the men's division and William Smith College competes only in the women's division. Nazareth announced plans to begin a women's hockey program that will begin UCHC competition for the 2018–19 season.The league did not have an automatic bid to the NCAA Division III Men's Ice Hockey Championship or the NCAA Division III Women's Ice Hockey Championship for the 2017–18 season but the Men's league gained the bid for the 2018–19 season and the Women's league did for the 2019-20 season.

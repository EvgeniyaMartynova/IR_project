List of Jewish prayers and blessings

Listed below are some Hebrew prayers and blessings that are part of Judaism that are recited by many Jews. Most prayers and blessings can be found in the Siddur, or prayer book. This article addresses Jewish liturgical blessings, which generally begin with the formula:

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' אֱ-לֹהֵינוּ, מֶלֶך הָעוֹלָם...
Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha`olam...
Translation: "Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe..."
NOTE: ' is used in transliterations to refer to the sh'vah, which is similar/equivalent to ə; a mid-word aleph, a glottal stop; and a mid-word ayin, a voiced pharyngeal fricative ʕ similar/equivalent to Arabic ع. Whenever ` is used, it refers to ayin whether word-initial, medial, or final. 'H/h' are used to represent both he, an English h sound as in "hat"; and ḥes, a voiceless pharyngeal fricative ħ equivalent to Arabic ح. Whenever 'ḥ' is used, it refers to ḥet. Resh is represented by an 'r,' though it's equivalent to Spanish 'r,' Spanish 'rr,' or French 'r,' depending on one's dialect. In all other regards, transliterations are according to the Sephardi tradition, with modern Hebrew pronunciation.

=== For putting on tzitzit ===

The tzitzit are first inspected to make sure they are properly intact before wearing the tallit katan. While holding the tallit katan, in readiness to put it on, the following blessing is recited:

After donning the tallit katan, many kiss the tzitzit; some additionally say the following:


==== For putting on a tallit gadol (prayer shawl) ====

Psalms 104:1–2 is traditionally read upon inspecting the tzitzit:

The blessing is recited before putting on the tallit:

After wrapping the tallit around the body, Psalms 36:8–11 is traditionally recited:


=== For putting on tefillin ===

Before the strap of the arm-tefillin is fastened, the following blessing is said:

Sephardic and Hasidic authorities are of the opinion that a blessing on laying the head-tefillin is not necessary and the one blessing on laying the arm-tefillin is sufficient. Ashkenazim, however, do recite a second blessing on the head-tefillin, before tightening it around the head:

The remainder of the arm-tefillin straps are then wound three times around the middle finger and around the hand. This is traditionally accompanied by the recitation of Hosea 2:21–22:


=== Blessings during a meal ===


==== N'tilat Yadayim (Ritual washing of hands) ====
The hands are ritually washed before partaking of certain staples of life.
In the Ashkenazic tradition and some Sephardic and other communities, it is done before eating bread. In some Sephardic rites and in the German community originating in Frankfurt it is done before drinking wine and or eating bread, alone or with the wine (such as would be done before a Sabbath or festive meal) at which time this blessing is said:
After washing but before drying the hands, the following blessing below is said.


==== Blessing over the bread ====
This blessing is made only for bread made from one or all of wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt.


==== After the meal ====

The combined blessing of Birkat Hamazon is made only after eating a meal containing bread (including matza) made from one or all of wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt.
After Birkat Hamazon, many Sephardic Jews of the Spanish and Portuguese rite recite Ya Comimos or sing Bendigamos. These prayers are similar in content to Birkat Hamazon.


==== Blessings over food ====
Additionally, appropriate blessings are said on food when not having a full (i.e. bread-based) meal.
There are five halakhic "food groups":


===== Before eating grain products – M'zonot =====
Before eating non-bread (e.g. cake) products of wheat, barley, rye, oats, or spelt (and rice, according to many opinions):


===== Before drinking wine – HaGefen =====
This blessing is made for wine made from grapes, but not any other fermented drink. Wine made from other fruits, and other alcohols, require the Shehakol blessing (see below). Also, hands might be ritually washed first depending on the minhag of the person saying the blessing on the grape wine (see above).


===== Before eating fruit – HaEtz =====


===== Before eating non-fruit produce – HaAdama =====
Before eating produce that grew directly from the earth:


===== Before eating other foods – SheHakol =====
Before eating or drinking any foods not in the first four categories:


== Holiday prayers and blessings ==


=== Shabbat ===


==== Shabbat candle lighting ====

A blessing is recited before lighting Shabbat candles.


==== Havdalah ceremony ====

Havdalah is recited Saturday night, usually about an hour after sunset, measured as the time when three stars appear in the sky, at which time Shabbat is over. It is a ceremony consisting of four blessings.


=== Hanukkah ===

Two blessings are recited as the Hanukkah candles are lit. On the first night, the Sheheheyanu blessing is said as well.


=== Yom Tov ===
Main article: Yom Tov


==== Candle lighting ====
On Yom Tov (when it falls on a weekday), it is permissible to transfer a flame (but not to create a new flame).
The festival candles should preferably be lit before sunset on erev yom tov (the afternoon before the holiday), but if they were not lit before sunset, they may (and should) be lit after sunset from a pre-existing flame.


==== Over apples and honey on Rosh Hashanah ====
On Rosh Hashanah eve, at the start of the festive meal, it is customary to dip some cut raw apples into some honey as symbolic of asking God to grant a sweet new year.

==== Eating in the sukkah ====

On the Sukkot holiday, a blessing is made before eating in the sukkah.


== Blessings on special occasions ==


=== Mezuzah ===

The following blessing is said when attaching a mezuzah to the doorpost:


=== Sheheḥeyanu ("Who has kept us alive") ===

This blessing is said whenever something pleasant that has not happened for a while is encountered. This includes all holidays except Shabbat. It is said on the first night of Hanukkah, but not for the other nights of that holiday. The blessing is also recited upon such occasions as affixing a mezuzah (particularly on a new home), buying new dress clothes, or eating a rare fruit.


=== On immersion in a Mikvah ===

This blessing is made on immersion in a mikvah (ritual bath), e.g. by a woman following menstruation. 

When immersing utensils in a mikvah, the final words are modified to "al tevliat keilim," or "concerning immersion of utensils."


=== Blessing for surviving illness or danger ===
The Birkhat HaGomel blessing is said after surviving illness, childbirth, or danger (including a hazardous journey or captivity).

Mizrahi Jews recite the following Biblical verse before the blessing:
Among Mizrahi Jews, the Congregational Response at the end begins as follows:
This prayer has its origins in the Talmud:

Rav Judah said, in the name of Rav, There are four person who have to offer thanksgiving: (1) One who has crossed the sea, (2) one who has crossed the wilderness, (3) one who has recovered from illness, and (4) one who has been freed from captivity.This was deduced from Psalm 107, where these four situations are mentioned.  In the days of the Temple, such a person would bring a thanksgiving sacrifice, but as this is no longer possible, such a person stands and recites the blessing.The word גמל (gomel) means a recompense, a reward, and frequently a generous benefit. Joseph H. Hertz, in his commentary to the prayerbook says:  "The Benediction is not limited to the above-mentioned four classes [listed in the Talmud quotation], but is recited after any signal escape from danger.  This Benediction is followed with deepfelt sympathy by the fellow-worshippers." Hertz mentions an instance in Britain in 1940 when was recited by an entire congregation because they were the survivors of a Blitz bombing of the previous night.Most halakhic authorities hold that the HaGomel blessing must be said publicly, in front of a minyan of 10. It is customary for men to say it after being called to the Torah. All Conservative and many Orthodox authorities hold that women are also obligated to say the Birkhat HaGomel blessing. The blessing is not time‑dependent (preferably it should be recited as soon after the deliverance from danger as the opportunity presents itself), and it substitutes in part for the toda (Thanksgiving) offering, one of the classes of korbanot (sacrifices) which women were obligated to offer (e.g. after childbirth) in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem. Accordingly, these authorities say that women are eligible to be counted in the minyan of 10 equally with men for the special purpose of the mitzvah of saying the HaGomel blessing and its congregational response publicly.

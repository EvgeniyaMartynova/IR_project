In a poll of 400 likely voters by EPIC/MRA, conducted on October 17 and 18, 2010, Benishek led with 42 percent to McDowell's 40 percent. Though Benishek won the Republican primary by a margin of only 15 votes, Allen, who placed second, chose not to seek a recount.Sabato's Crystal Ball rated the race as "Leans Republican". In October 2010 The Cook Political Report and CQ Politics rated the race as "Leans Republican". In November 2010 The Rothenberg Political Report rated the race as "Toss-up/Tilt Republican". Prior to the election FiveThirtyEight's forecast gave Benishek an 88 percent chance of winning, and projected that he would receive 52 percent of the vote to McDowell's 45 percent. On election day Benishek was elected with 52 percent of the vote to McDowell's 41 percent. Benishek was re-elected in 2012, again against McDowell, and in 2014.

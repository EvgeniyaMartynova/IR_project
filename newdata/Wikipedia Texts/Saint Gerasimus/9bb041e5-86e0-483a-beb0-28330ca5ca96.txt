Gerasimus of Kefalonia

Venerable Saint Gerasimos of Kefalonia (Greek: Άγιος Γεράσιμος) is the patron saint of the island of Kefalonia in Greece.


== Life ==
Gerasimos (1506–1579) came from the aristocratic and wealthy Notaras family. He was ordained a Monk at Mount Athos, went to Jerusalem for 12 years, spent some time in Crete and Zakynthos and in 1555 arrived on Kefalonia. He spent his first 5 years in a cave in the area known as Lassi. He subsequently cultivated the area where the monastery of Saint Gerasimos now exists near Valsamata.  The monastery which he established cared for the poor and became a center for charity.


== Veneration ==
Saint Gerasimos is believed by natives of Kefalonia to protect them and to also heal them of illness.  Many natives of the island name their children after Saint Gerasimos as a tribute to the saint who protects them.
The body of Saint Gerasimos is at the monastery, made available for veneration as it has never decomposed.  After his death, his body was buried twice and exhumed intact, thus leading the church to ordain him as a saint.  Kefalonians throughout the world still revere and pray to him.
In 1953, immediately after a powerful earthquake on the island of Kefalonia destroyed 90% of the island, there were many claimed sightings of Saint Gerasimos throughout the island who is believed to have comforted and tended to the injured trapped inside homes and buildings.
During the feasts of Saint Gerasimos – August 16th and 20 October (translation of relics) – his body is passed over ill and sick persons for the purpose of healing them.  His body is also displayed by the church during liturgy at the monastery on many occasions.
A church named after Saint Gerasimos was established in New York City by Kefalonians who emigrated to New York in the early 20th century.

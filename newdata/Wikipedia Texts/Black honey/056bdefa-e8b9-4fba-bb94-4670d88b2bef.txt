Kuromitsu

Kuromitsu (黒蜜)  is a Japanese sugar syrup, literally "black honey".  It is similar to molasses, but thinner and milder. 
It is typically made from unrefined kokutō, and is a central ingredient in many Japanese sweets.  It is one of the ingredients used in making wagashi, and it goes well with kuzumochi, fruits, ice cream, pancakes, etc.

Black Honey (album)

Black Honey is a British four-piece indie rock band formed in Brighton, England in 2014. The band is composed of lead singer and guitarist Izzy Baxter Phillips, guitarist Chris Ostler, bassist Tommy Taylor, and drummer Tom Dewhurst. The band released an eponymous self-titled debut EP in late 2014 followed by a series of singles leading to the release of self-titled debut album in 2018.In early incarnations, Black Honey were partly defined by their signature guitar sound which evokes spaghetti westerns, Tarantino movies and Twin Peaks type connotations. Although this sound continues to be present in the latest material, the band's repertoire in this aspect has expanded since the middle of 2017.
Through 2014 to 2017, Black Honey's output consisted of the regular release of Singles and EP's. The EP "Black Honey" was released in 2014, and the EP "Headspin" followed in 2016. One of the characteristics of these releases was the vinyl format, featuring ambitious artwork by Olivia Savage, which remains an emblematic element of a Black Honey "physical copy".
The self titled  debut album  was  released on 21 September 2018, it reached number 33 in the UK album chart, despite being unsigned to any major record label. The album is wide-ranging in its genres, borrowing elements from pop, hip-hop, indie and rock. With this album, the band have clearly pursued a more ambitious objective than previously.
The musicians are known as being protective of their creative control and as a result have released material when they think it is right. The band members are directly involved in all aspects of music production and also video production in collaboration with chosen directors/producers. The band are also involved with other artistic content such as fashion, publicity and album art.

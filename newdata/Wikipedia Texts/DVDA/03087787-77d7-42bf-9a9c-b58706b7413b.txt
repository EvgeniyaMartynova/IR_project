DVDA (band)

DVDA is a comedy band featuring the South Park crew members Trey Parker (lead vocals, keyboards), Matt Stone (vocals, bass guitar, drums), Bruce Howell (guitars), D. A. Young (keyboards, vocals) and Nels Dielman (drums). The name refers to a sexual position meaning "double vaginal, double anal", referenced in the duo's film Orgazmo. DVDA's songs appear in several other works written, directed and/or starring Stone and Parker.
A portion of DVDA's songs satirize other songs, such as "Montage" which satirizes the "Push It to The Limit" montage sequence from the film Scarface. The band has opened for Ween and Primus and performed at the Lapdance film festival in 2000.

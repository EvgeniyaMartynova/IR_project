H100 series

The H100 series (H100å½¢) is a diesel-electric multiple unit (DEMU) train type on order by Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido) to replace ageing KiHa 40 series DMU cars. The trains are nicknamed "DECMO", standing for "Diesel Electric Car with MOtors". Two pre-series cars were delivered in February 2018 for testing and evaluation.


== Design ==
Based on the GV-E400 series DMUs on order by JR East, the H100 series trains are the first diesel-electric multiple units to be operated by JR Hokkaido, with diesel engines driving generators, which in turn power electric traction motors. The trains have stainless steel bodies, and a maximum speed of 100 km/h (60 mph).


== Interior ==
Passenger accommodation will consist of longitudinal seating close to the doorways, and 2+1 transverse seating inside the cars. The cars will have universal access toilets.


== History ==
Details about the new trains were announced by JR Hokkaido on 12 July 2017. Two single-car pre-series units were delivered from the Kawasaki Heavy Industries factory in Kobe in February 2018. These will undergo test-running and evaluation until March 2019.

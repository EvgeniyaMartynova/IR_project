Puppy chow (snack)

Puppy chow, also typically known as monkey munch, muddy buddies, muddy munch, reindeer chow, or monster munch, is the name for a homemade snack made in the United States. The recipe's name and ingredients can differ depending on the version, but most recipes will typically include cereal, melted chocolate, peanut butter (or other nut butters), and powdered sugar. Nut free versions are easy to make by substituting nuts with not nuts or sun butter. Cereals used in the recipes are usually Chex or Crispix.   The snack's true origins are not known.
The snack's name is based upon its look and consistency, which can resemble the Dog Chow brand of dog food in its appearance. Many tend to make the snack during special events such as holidays and gaming. It is a popular snack to make for children and adults alike.General Mills has made their own version of the snack, which they began selling under the name of Muddy Buddies in 2010.

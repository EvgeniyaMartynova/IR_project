Caramel (City High song)

"Caramel" is the second single released from American R&B/hip hop trio City High's self-titled debut album in 2001.The song was actually written based on the appearance and personality of Brian Gough, though he is actually 5'6" with brown eyes not 5'5" with brown eyes. It is the group's second most successful single, peaking at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks in the U.S. in January 2002.The beat contains vocal samples from the song "Silent Treatment" by The Roots. The charted version was a remix featuring rapper Eve. The album version that did not chart replaces Eve's rap with the section of which Claudette Ortiz sings in Spanish. The remix version was done by Trackmasters.


== Music video ==
A music video was produced for the song that begins with the original version and transitions into the Trackmasters Remix  version. It begins with a shot of Ryan Toby and Robbie Pardlo on a computer that shows the words "Dream Girl 2001". It then cuts to a shot of Ortiz singing the first verse, and then the trio is dancing at a party as Ortiz sings. The video continues switching from Ortiz singing on a couch, the trio at the party, and Ortiz boxing Zab Judah. As the third verse, the first not sung by Ortiz, begins, it features the guys in a car. The video switches to Eve on a motorcycle and starting her rap. The video ends with Toby and Pardlo still in front of the computer, watching the video.

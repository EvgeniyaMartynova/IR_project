Fiat 500e

The Fiat 500 (codeproject Type 312) is a two-door, four-passenger, transverse front-engine, front-wheel-drive A-segment city car manufactured and marketed by the Fiat subdivision of FCA since 2007 in hatchback coupé and fixed-profile convertible body styles, over a single generation — with an intermediate facelift in Europe with model year 2016 . The 500 is internally designated as the Type 312 by FCA.
Derived from the 2004 Fiat Trepiùno 3+1 concept (designed by Roberto Giolito), the 500's styling recalls Fiat's 1957 Fiat 500, nicknamed the Bambino — a model that was designed and engineered by Dante Giacosa with more than 4 million sold over its 18-year (1957-1975) production span.Translated from concept to production design under the design direction of Frank Stephenson, the 500 features Dante Giacosa's 1964 breakthrough front-wheel drive breakthrough layout — which ultimately became an industry standard, the layout "adopted by virtually every other manufacturer in the world" for front-wheel driveThe 500 uses Fiat's Multiair hydraulically actuated variable valve timing (VVT) engine technology, winner of the 2010 International Engine of the Year as well as Popular Science's Best of What's New.Announced on May 5, 2006, photographs of the 500 were presented on March 20, 2007, officially debuting on July 4, 2007, with 250,000 people in attendance and with new models prominently displayed in 30 Italian cities.Manufactured in Tychy, Poland and Toluca, Mexico, the 500 is marketed in more than 100 countries worldwide, including North America, where the 500 marked Fiat's market return after 27 years. With the millionth Fiat 500 produced in 2012; and production reaching 2 million in 2017, after 10 years, the 500 has won more than 40 major awards, including the CAR Magazine Car of the Year (2007) and the World's Most Beautiful Automobile. In 2009, an art installation designed by architect Fabio Novembre featured 20 full-size fiberglass replicas of the Fiat 500C, shaped as planters, along Milan's famous Via Monte Napoleone.


== Development ==
Since 1998, Fiat's entry-level model in Europe had been the Polish-built Seicento, itself an updated version of the 1991 Cinquecento. These models had only ever been sold with three doors, although Fiat had responded to the growing demand for five-door city cars in 2003 by launching the Panda, which replaced a three-door model of the same name which had slotted into Fiat's European range between the Cinquecento/Seicento and the larger Punto. Around the time of the Panda's launch, Fiat set about developing a three-door city car to replace the Cinquecento.
Driven by the tremendous success of the Smart Fortwo, especially in Italy, Fiat began examining a variety of small car concepts "to regain its small-car crown," — developing an "intense interest at producing a Smart (Fortwo) competitor" — and concluding that "most customers want more than just the Smart's two seats."The 2004 Fiat Trepiùno concept, from which the 500 derives, was introduced at the 74th Geneva Motorshow — designed at Centro Stile Fiat by Roberto Giolito in a style strongly reminiscent of the original Fiat 5001957.The name "Trepiùno" is a contraction of the Italian words "tre più uno", or "three plus one" in English; as the design accommodates three adults and one child — by reducing requirements ahead of the front passenger (with high-tech, space-saving, thin materials), sliding the front passenger forward, and positioning the third adult directly behind the passenger, allowing a fourth, smaller, occasional passenger to sit behind the driver.The concept design was translated into the 2007 production model under the direction of Frank Stephenson. According to Stephenson, aerodynamic concerns were paramount with the new 500, saying we preferred the look without the spoiler as on the original Nuova 500.  Nonetheless, the small rear spoiler at the top of the rear hatch provides a CD of .32 — where without the spoiler the drag coefficient would have been 0.40.The 500 uses a widened variant of the Fiat Mini platform.


== Models ==
In addition to the distinct 500C (cabrio), Abarth (full sport), and 500e (all-electric) models, the 500 is marketed variously around the globe with other trim levels — for example, the Sport and Turbo trim levels in the United States, and the Pop Star trim levels in Europe.


=== 500C (2009-) ===

The fixed-profile convertible variant of the 500 debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2009 designated the 500C (C for Cabrio), historically recalling the fixed-profile convertible of the original 1957 Fiat 500 — as well as similar fixed-profile convertibles such as the Vespa 400 (1957), Citroën DS 3 (2013), Nissan Figaro (1991), Citroën 2CV (1948–1990) and the Nash Rambler Convertible "Landau" Coupe (1950).
The 500C features fully stamped body-side panels retaining the hatchback 500's profile (door frames, roof pillars and side windows) to increase structural rigidity, reduce scuttle shake, and retain side and curtain airbags — in trade for a less open experience than a fully pillarless convertible. Weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) more than its hatchback counterpart, the 500C features a slightly longer windshield than the hatchback, with a concealed and reinforced upper structural cross-member; a stronger front cross-member behind the instrument panel; a rear strut on which the retracted roof folds; reinforced B-pillars; and the rear anti-roll bar setup from the Abarth, high performance model.
The top itself is a  dual-layer, three-position power-retractable cloth top with a glass rear window,  electric defroster and an integrated color-matched spoiler with a center high-mounted stop lamp that remains visible with the top in any position. The top retracts in three stages: over the two front passengers, over all four passengers (to the rear spoiler) and fully retracted with its stack folded behind the rear head restraints just above the rear cargo opening.  The top is controlled either via the key remote or by open/close buttons at the windshield header adjacent to the interior ceiling light and retracts to the first two stages at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph), to its third stage at up to 50 mph — and is available in black, tan or red.
With its 50/50 split-fold rear seats in their upright position, the 500C rear cargo capacity is reduced from 9 cubic feet to 5.4 feet compared to the hatchback — offering 23.4 cubic feet cargo volume with the 50/50 split-fold rear seats folded.  At its rear trunk lid, the 500C features "parallelogram" liftgate hinges.  When the rear cargo lid is opened while top is fully lowered, the top automatically closes partly — for greater cargo access. Because of limited rear visibility, 500C models are equipped with an ultrasonic rear park assist system to audibly indicate obstacles when backing.


=== Abarth 500 (2008-) ===
The Abarth 500 is a performance model of the Fiat 500 tuned in-house by FCA's Abarth subsidiary. It was unveiled at the 78th Geneva Motor Show, a year after the rebirth of Abarth brand and company. All models use a turbocharged and intercooled version of the 1.4 L Fire I4 petrol engine.
The Abarth 500's 1.4 L engine is equipped with an IHI RHF3-P turbocharger, and is rated at 135 PS (99 kW; 133 hp) at 5,500 rpm and 180 N⋅m (130 lb⋅ft) (206 N⋅m (152 lb⋅ft) in sport mode) torque at 3,000 rpm. It includes a five-speed C510 transmission, low ride suspension, electric power steering with sport setting, 6.5 x 16" aluminium alloy rim with 195/45 R16 tyres and four-wheel disc brakes (front ventilated). Interior includes turbo pressure gauge, gear shift indicator, aluminum foot pedals, Blue&Me entertainment system with telemetry and GPS. The car costs £13,600 in the UK.  A 5-speed semi-automatic transmission (called MTA) is available as an alternative to the manual transmission.
The Abarth version of the 500C (cabriolet) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. Abarth 500C has top speed of 205 km/h (127 mph) and it can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 8.1 seconds.


=== Fiat 500e (2013-) ===
An electric conversion of the Fiat 500 was first shown at the London Motor Show in July 2008. The non-OEM conversion, carried out by Micro-Vett, entailed fitting a 22 kWh lithium-ion battery pack and an electric motor but retained the 5-speed transmission; it was marketed by the NICE (No Internal Combustion Engine) Car Company and was on sale for GB£25,000 (equivalent to £32,800 in 2018). The NICE/Micro-Vett 500 claimed a range of 75 miles (121 km) and a top speed of 60 mi/h (97 km/h).A prototype electric 500 by Fiat/Chrysler was shown as the 500 Elettra or 500 BEV Concept at the 2010 Detroit Auto Show in January, positioned as a competitor to the Mini E, although details of the electric vehicle were not initially available. The electrified 500 appeared to be a working prototype, as it contained a traction battery and motor with a pushbutton transmission. Shortly after the show, Fiat/Chrysler announced an all-electric 500, based on the 500 Elettra Concept, would go into production starting in 2012. It had a target range of 100 miles (160 km) and an estimated retail price of $32,000, half of which was attributed to the cost of the battery. The production 500e was unveiled in November 2012, at the Los Angeles Auto Show, followed by Frankfurt Motor Show 2013.
AvailabilityDeliveries began in California by July 2013, and around 2,310 units were sold in the U.S. in 2013. The American rollout was scheduled to continue to other states with mandates of sales of zero emission vehicles, but Fiat-Chrysler does not have plans to make the 500e officially available in Europe. The Fiat 500e went on sale in Oregon in the summer of 2014, and sales are limited to just two states. However, Scuderia-E has imported and sold used 500e vehicles which were originally on sale in the United States for the European market, refitted with higher-capacity batteries and a CCS combination socket for fast charging.The 500e is assembled at the Toluca Car Assembly plant in Mexico.
DesignThe 500e is powered by a 111 hp (83 kW) and 147 lb⋅ft (199 N⋅m) permanent-magnet, three-phase synchronous-drive electric motor, and its 24 kWh liquid-cooled/heated li-ion battery delivers a range of 80 mi (130 km), and up to 100 mi (160 km) in city driving according to Chrysler. The combination of alternating current motor, battery, and inverter has a claimed efficiency of 92%. Charge time is less than four hours when connected to a Level 2 (240 volt) source using the on-board 6.6 kW charging module. Although the 500e does not come equipped with or offers as an option a DC fast charging connector, the development engineers state the car is equipped to handle charging at up to 480V and 70 amps if the appropriate connector is retrofitted to the car.The official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) range is 87 mi (140 km). Under its five-cycle testing, the EPA rated the 500e combined fuel economy at 116 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe) (2.0 L/100 km equivalent) overall, 122 MPGe (1.9 L/100 km equivalent) in city driving and 108 MPGe (2.4 L/100 km equivalent) on the highway. Regenerative braking is employed to extend range; under normal braking (i.e., excluding panic and emergency stops), the brake pedal engages only regenerative braking down to speeds of 8 mi/h (13 km/h), when the conventional mechanical brakes begin to engage.Robert Bosch GmbH supplies all the powertrain components for the 500e, including the electric motor, power electronics, and battery. The motor, which Bosch have designated the SMG ("sequential motor-generator") 180/120, is shared with other vehicles, including the smart fortwo electric and PSA GROUP's HYbrid4. The SMG 180/120 weighs just 62 lb (28 kg) and spins at a speed up to 12,500 rpm. The inverter, designated INVCON 2.3 by Bosch, converts direct current energy stored in the traction battery to alternating current for the SMG 180/120 and weighs less than 15 lb (7 kg) in a package 12.2 in × 7.5 in × 6.1 in (310 mm × 190 mm × 156 mm) (L×W×H), including connectors. Chrysler developed and integrated the electric powertrain, and reportedly had been working on an electrified 500 even before the company was purchased by Fiat. Ward's named the 500e powertrain to its list of 10 Best Engines for 2014.

Designers and engineers of the Fiat 500e worked to minimize drag while keeping the iconic styling of the conventional powered Fiat 500. For the 500e to achieve a 0.311 coefficient of drag (Cd), as compared to the 2013 Fiat 500 Lounge model's 0.359 Cd, eight exterior refinements were developed in the wind tunnel to enable the 48 count drag reduction. The result of hours of wind-tunnel testing allowed the 500e to achieve an additional five miles of range compared to its gasoline-powered sibling. Among these changes are front fascia sealing, aerodynamically optimized front fascia design, drag-reducing rear fascia design, liftgate-mounted aerodynamic spoiler, and under-vehicle bellypans. The battery adds 600 pounds (270 kg) for a total kerb weight of approximately 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg), but it is located low in the chassis behind the front seats, changing the front:rear weight balance from 64:36 (on the conventionally gas-powered 500) to 57:43 (for the 500e).Development of the production 500e started with prototypes assembled by hand at Chrysler headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan; the prototypes used components from suppliers (later announced as Bosch) and were shipped to Sonoma County, California (as the initial planned market was California) for testing in the summer of 2012. The Chrysler engineering team was tasked with integrating the hardware components and tuning the finished car to behave as close to a conventionally gas-powered 500 as possible. Some of the aerodynamic refinements developed for the production 500e were intended to be backfitted to the regular 500.

Fiat describes the 500e's unique exterior design as retro-futuristic, and the vehicle has a smartphone app that notifies the owner of the vehicle's status. Behind the steering wheel the 500e has an all-new 7-inch thin-film transistor (TFT) display to provide increased functionality with more intuitively delivered information of the power gauge, driving range and state of charge. In addition, the new Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC) utilizes its full-color capabilities with the use of picture graphics to illustrate vehicle functions including a trip computer, tire-pressure monitoring and vehicle status messaging system. The available TomTom navigation pairs with the Fiat 500e's standard BLUE&ME Handsfree Communication technology and features a 4.3-inch touchscreen display mounted on top of the instrument panel.
PricingThe Fiat 500e pricing starts at US$32,500 including a US$700 destination charge and before any applicable government incentives. Leasing is available with a down payment of US$999 due at signing and US$199 per month lease for 36 months. The leasing pricing is the same as the current lease offer on a gasoline-powered Fiat 500 Pop. Sergio Marchionne reported that Fiat loses $14,000 on every 500e it sells, and only produces the cars because California rules require automobile manufacturers who sell a certain number of cars in the state to sell a percentage of that total as zero emissions vehicles.In April 2013, Fiat North America announced that to avoid range anxiety concerns and allow customers to cover longer travel distances, each 500e purchase will include the use of rental vehicles for up to 12 days a year for free through the first three years of ownership. The program, called ePass, entitles 500e owners to a business account with enough points to rent a gasoline-powered standard car with Enterprise Holdings, which owns Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National Car Rental and Alamo Rent a Car. Fiat will deposit additional points the following two years to extend the program. The gasoline-powered cars available for the ePass program are the Fiat 500, the upcoming Fiat 500L, the Dodge Dart or the Chrysler 200. Customers will also have the option to upgrade to a larger vehicle such as a minivan or a pickup truck subject to terms of the program.Some electric cars depreciate more rapidly than conventionally powered cars and trucks, according to NerdWallet if depreciation is calculated based on the pre-tax credit price. For all-electric cars depreciation varies between 60% to 75% in three years. In contrast, most conventionally powered vehicles in the same period depreciate between 45% to 50%. In 2016, it was reported that wholesale prices of used three-year old Fiat 500e were as low as US$5,000 (equivalent to $5,220 in 2018), and were being sold at retail for US$10,000 (equivalent to $10,440 in 2018).
SalesThe entire production run of 2013 models was sold out by June 2013, before the first cars were delivered to new owners. About 16,549 units have been sold in the U.S. through May 2016. Because Fiat/Chrysler does not report sales of the 500e model independently, sales figures are estimated from state rebate data.
RecallsIn August 2013 Chrysler issued a recall to replace bolts that secure the Fiat 500e half-drive-shafts. The recall is not related to the 500e's electric powertrain and affected 291 model year 2013 Fiat 500e cars, including vehicles at dealers' lots. When an investigation was launched after a customer's 500e exhibited power loss, engineers discovered two assembly steps that had not been properly completed, thereby creating a condition that could lead to half-shaft separation. Fiat 500e owners affected by the recall will receive free rental vehicles while their cars are being repaired at no charge.

=== Engines ===
FCA launched the 500 with three Euro5-compliant engines: two petrol/gasoline and one diesel engine. The 1.3 Multijet was equipped with a diesel particulate filter (DPF). Despite the 500's name, which originally corresponded to its engine displacement, the lowest displacement is 1242 cc with 69 metric horsepower (PS), notably larger and more powerful than both the original 5001957-1975 and the Cinquecento1991–1998.
A smaller, turbocharged two-cylinder Twinair engine with 85 PS was later unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, entering production the following year. 
The TwinAir received the Best New Engine Award for 2011 and was marketed the "world's greenest petrol engine," based on official Euro test cycle data for emissions and fuel consumption.A naturally aspirated version of the TwinAir was introduced later with larger bore and longer stroke, a displacement of 964 cc (0.964 L; 58.8 cu in) and a higher compression ratio. This engine delivers 60 PS (44 kW; 59 hp). Availability is limited to selected markets, e.g., the Netherlands.The 105PS 0.9 TwinAir engine model was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.

=== Safety ===
The new 500 has seven airbags in all models and available ABS brakes, ESP (electronic stability program), ASR (antislip regulation), HBA (hydraulic brake assistance) and hill holder. The 500 was awarded five stars by EuroNCAP, succeeding the BMW MINI as the shortest car to have a five-star rating. Fiat also said that the 500 was engineered so that it would have achieved a six-star rating had EuroNCAP adopted this classification.
The Fiat 500 passed the Euro NCAP car safety tests with following ratings:

The car was named "Worst Car For Passenger Injuries" in a study by a US based insurance group analysed rates for Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Medical Payments (MedPay) policies, which cover payouts to injured passengers.The Fiat 500 also scored "Poor" in small overlap crash testing by the IIHS

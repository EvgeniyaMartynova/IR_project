GamePlay (game engine)

Decima is a proprietary game engine launched in November 2013. It houses tools and features like artificial intelligence and game physics. The engine is compatible with 4K resolution and high-dynamic-range imaging used for games on the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows.


== History ==
The first game the engine was used for was Killzone Shadow Fall. In June 2015, Guerrilla Games announced that Horizon Zero Dawn was using the engine for development. In August 2015, Until Dawn was announced to be using the engine along with Havok physics. In December 2015, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood used the engine along with PlayStation VR.  In June 2016, Hideo Kojima announced preparation for Kojima Productions' independent game Death Stranding, inspecting two engine candidates, of which the latter had been used to create the first teaser that was unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 conference. After receiving the Industry Icon award at The Game Awards 2016, Kojima premiered a trailer for the game with the engine's logo. At PlayStation Experience, Kojima had announced that he had partnered with Guerrilla Games, using the engine for development on Death Stranding. According to executive producer Angie Smets, they had simply called it "the engine", until Kojima said he wanted to work with it and had to spontaneously come up with a name: Dejima, the island where a Dutch trading post appeared in the 17th century and once symbolized the strong Dutchâ€“Japanese trade relations. For a long time, the Netherlands was the only foreign country allowed to trade with Japan.

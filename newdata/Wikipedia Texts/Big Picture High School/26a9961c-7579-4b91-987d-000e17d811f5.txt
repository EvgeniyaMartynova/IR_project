Durango, Colorado

Durango is the county seat and the most populous municipality of La Plata County, Colorado, United States.  It is home to Fort Lewis College. The United States Census Bureau reported a population of 16,887 in the 2010 census.


== History ==
The town was organized in September 1880 to serve the San Juan mining district. The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG) chose the site on the Animas River for its depot following a brief and most likely perfunctory negotiation with Animas City, two miles to the north. The city was named by ex-Colorado Governor Alexander C. Hunt after Durango, Mexico, based on his favorable impression of that city resulting from a scouting trip undertaken on behalf of William J. Palmer, the head of the D&RG.

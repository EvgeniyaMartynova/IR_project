Her eldest son by her second marriage, Christopher Sandford, was proprietor of the Golden Cockerel Press.
She spent much of the early part of the last century crossing Europe in Creeping Jenny, a caravan drawn by white oxen, and is credited with being the first person to install a bath in a mobile home.

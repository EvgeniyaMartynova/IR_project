== Choral music ==
Choral department
The Parkersburg South High School Choral Department has been creating musical excellence since the school’s inception in the fall of 1967. Eric Roth, a young music educator began building the choral program at Parkersburg South High School. The Patriot Chorus (now formally known as the Concert Choir) and the Women’s Chorus began performing for local and state events. 
Following Eric Roth, directors Mr. Matheny and Bev Roney were instrumental in continuing to build a foundation of musical excellence. In the fall of 1974, Daniel B. Thomas created the Lords and Ladies of Parkersburg South High School: The Madrigal Singers.  The Madrigal Singers became a popular group throughout the Mid-Ohio Valley and across the state of West Virginia. The Madrigal Singers presented Renaissance music at its highest quality by striving to recreate the time period through costuming and sound. 
In the fall of 1997, Pamela McClain began the Chamber Ensemble to add another avenue of musicianship at Parkersburg South. With all three performing groups at Parkersburg South, the Choral Department had traveled throughout much of the eastern United States and Canada receiving superior marks from adjudicators and winning numerous awards. The Parkersburg South High School choral department remains very active throughout the school year and sings for various functions throughout the community. 
In 2004, Ms. Melissa R. Life became the sixth director at the high school and has vowed to keep the tradition of musical excellence alive and well. In 2008, the Parkersburg South Choral Department now includes, along with the concert and chamber choirs, and the madrigal singers, a new freshman chorus (due to the integration of the 9th grade in the high school system), and a women's chorus, Bella Voce. In the spring, Ms. Life is preparing a men's chorus as well.

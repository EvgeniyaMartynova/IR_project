Tyler Mowry House

The Tyler Mowry House is an historic house at 112 Sayles Hill Road in North Smithfield, Rhode Island.  It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a gable roof and two interior chimneys.  The entry is centered on the main (south-facing) facade, with sidelight windows and pilasters supporting a complex entablature and cornice.  A 1-1/2 story ell extends to the east.  The interior of the house has retained much of the original Federal-period woodwork, plasterwork, doors, and hardware.  The house is distinctive as a remarkably unaltered house from the early 19th century, lacking modernizing alterations such as electricity and plumbing.The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

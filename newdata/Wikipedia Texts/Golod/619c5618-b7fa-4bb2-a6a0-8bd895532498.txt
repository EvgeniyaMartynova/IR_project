Evgeny Golod

Evgenii Solomonovich Golod  (Russian: Евгений Соломонович Голод, October 21, 1935 – July 5, 2018) was a Russian mathematician who proved the Golod–Shafarevich theorem on class field towers. As an application, he gave a negative solution to the Kurosh–Levitzky problem on the nilpotency of finitely generated nil algebras, and so to a weak form of Burnside's problem.
Golod was a student of Igor Shafarevich. As of 2015, Golod had 39 academic descendants, most of them through his student Luchezar L. Avramov.

Skyline Conference

The Skyline Conference is a college athletic conference based in the New York City area that competes in the NCAA's Division III.
The league was originally chartered on May 16, 1989 as a men's basketball conference and now sponsors 17 sports (nine for men and 8 for women). The Skyline Conference sponsors baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's golf, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's soccer, softball, men's and women's swimming and diving, men's and women's tennis, and men's and women's volleyball.
Primarily comprising schools from the New York metropolitan area, the Skyline Conference currently has 11 full-time member schools, as well as five part-time members that compete in men's lacrosse and men's volleyball only.
Prior to the 2007-08 academic year, the league introduced the Skyline Presidents Cup. St. Joseph's (LI) won the first three Presidents Cups (2007-10), followed by Farmingdale State winning in 2010-11. St. Joseph's (LI) collected its fourth Presidents Cup in 2011-12, with Farmingdale State regaining the title in both 2012-13 and 2013-14.
In May 2018, Manhattanville College announced that they would leave the MAC Freedom Conference and return to the Skyline for the 2019-20 academic year.  Manhattanville was a charter member of the Skyline before leaving to join the MAC in 2007.

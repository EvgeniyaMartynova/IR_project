The company was acquired in 1993 by  Firas Chamsi-Pasha, a Syrian former agent of Hield. Mr Chamsi-Pasha dropped 90% of the company's customer base and concentrated its production in the most expensive segment of the cloth market, with retail price up to £4,200 a metre in 2005 for fabrics such as a 12.9 micron wool or a super-fine wool with an 18 ct gold stripe. Mr Chamsi-Pasha marketed Super 180s fabrics in 1998 and Super 210s fabrics in 2000. He claimed in 2003 he was willing to pay "silly prices" to acquire wool with a fiber measuring less than 12 microns and had bought 26 pounds of wool with a fiber measuring 11.5 microns. The company uses antique machinery together with up-to-date equipment, such as a £120,000 scouring machine.

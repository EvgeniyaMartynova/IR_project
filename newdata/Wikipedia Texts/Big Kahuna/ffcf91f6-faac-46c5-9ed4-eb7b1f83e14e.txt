Noah's Ark Waterpark

Noah's Ark (officially Noah's Ark Family Park Inc.) is the largest water park in the United States. It features 51 water slides and dozens of various attractions. The park is located in the village of Lake Delton, Wisconsin.


== History ==
In 1979, the Waterman family purchased 205 feet (62 m) of frontage property on U.S. Route 12 in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin and created a bumper boat ride and built a go-kart track. The park opened as "Noah's Incredible Adventure," which became the name of a Noah's Ark attraction in 2003. In 1994, the Gantz family of Dubuque, Iowa, purchased Noah's Ark and added the "OctoExplorer", a yellow submarine with moving periscope, water guns and soft-surfaced waterslides. In 2003, Noah's Ark Waterpark celebrated 25 years of operation. In 2012, the park was purchased by Palace Entertainment.
While under ownership of Palace Entertainment, six attractions have been closed and three have been added. Other changes include fencing the park's perimeter, removing of per-use lockers, and instituting a fee for parking.
The iconic ark structure at the front of the park was destroyed by an electrical fire in 2012. Originally a ticket office, the ark was being used as a museum and storage facility at the time of the fire.


== Rides ==
The park uses over 2 million gallons of water on its rides every day. Its lifeguards earned the Platinum Award from Jeff Ellis and Associates Inc. (2006, 2017), the highest waterpark safety rating possible.

=== San Jose Earthquakes (2003–2005) ===
Dominic Kinnear states that the first time the Earthquakes coaching staff first got a good look at Brian Ching was facing him in the July 17, 2002 third round match of the U.S. Open Cup when San Jose defeated the Seattle Sounders 4-3 after sudden death extra time. Kinnear, assistant coach at the time, and head coach Frank Yallop were impressed with how Ching matched up with Earthquakes defender Eddie Robinson, considered one of the best defenders in MLS at the time. Ching began training with the Earthquakes the following January. On February 11, 2003, San Jose traded Devin Barclay to D.C. United in exchange for the first overall pick in the 2003 MLS Supplemental Draft and on February 28, 2013, they used that pick to draft Ching.Ching made his official Earthquakes debut in Guatemala City on March 16, 2003, playing a full match in a 4-2 Champions' Cup loss to C.S.D.

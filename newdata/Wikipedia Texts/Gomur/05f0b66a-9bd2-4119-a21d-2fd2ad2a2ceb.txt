Gomk

Gomk (Armenian: Գոմք; also Romanized as Gomk’; formerly Gomur) is a small village in the Vayots Dzor Province of Armenia.  In the village is a 17th-century church and an important shrine/khachkar from 1263.  The inscription upon it reads, 

In 712 of the Armenian era, under the pious Prince Prosh, Mkhitar, Arevik, son of Khoidan, set up this cross and chapel.  In the village there was not even a church.  We have built this church with our own means with much trouble, for us and our parents. You who read, remember us in your prayers.

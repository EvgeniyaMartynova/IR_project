The movie performed moderately at the box office. However, The comedy between Sathyaraj and Goundamani was well received and appreciated by the public. The movie is especially famous for Meena's glamour. Even though Meena had done glamorous roles in Telugu and Kannada movies regularly, this was the first time she had been overtly glamorous in a Tamil movie.
There was a high anticipation for this movie since the previous combination where Sathyaraj, Meena and Guru Dhanapal were associated with in the movie Thai Maaman went very well and was a super hit at the box office.

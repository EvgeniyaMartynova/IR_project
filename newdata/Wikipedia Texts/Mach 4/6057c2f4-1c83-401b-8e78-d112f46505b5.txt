Fly Castelluccio Mach

The Fly Castelluccio Mach is a family of Italian paramotors that was designed and produced by Fly Castelluccio of Ascoli Piceno for powered paragliding. Now out of production, when it was available the aircraft were supplied complete and ready-to-fly.


== Design and development ==
The Mach was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules as well as European regulations. It features a paraglider-style wing, single-place accommodation and a single 14 hp (10 kW) Solo 210 engine in pusher configuration powering a two-bladed or four-bladed wooden propeller through a reduction drive.As is the case with all paramotors, take-off and landing is accomplished by foot. Inflight steering is accomplished via handles that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw.

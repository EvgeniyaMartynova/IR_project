Hendra was originally a farming district, an expansion of the Nundah settlement. The crops were citrus fruits, grapes and pineapples. There were also dairy herds.The Brisbane Courier advertised the “Grand drawing and distribution of land prizes”  in January 1870. This portion of land had been part of land allocated to the Queensland Turf Club, tickets were advertised at £1 each.  A plan for the subdivision notes its location within the Parish of Toombul and Eagle Farm Racecourse reserve. In October 1887 "Hendra Railway Station Estate" was advertised to be auctioned by James R. Dickson & Company Auctioneers. The estate was made up of 83 allotments and was advertised as being close to both Hendra and Clayfield stations. The area was then part of the Shire of Toombul. 
In  March 1889, “Raceview Estate” comprised 34 allotments, was advertised to be auctioned by John MacNamarra & Co Real Property Salesmen. The estate was part of the Eagle Farm Racecourse Reserve, close to Hendra Railway Station and overlooking the Racecourse itself. In September 1926 “Petersen Estate” was advertised to be auctioned by A.S.Phillips & Sons, Auctioneers. The estate comprised 25 allotments  with some fronting Newmarket and Gerler roads. The remaining streets that formed the estate are now known as Rita St, Dorames St and Olive St. The map advertising the sale also notes its proximity to Hendra State School, Nudgee Road and its convenience to Hendra Railway station.

Crayon (band)

Crayon was an indie pop band from Washington State featuring Brad Roberts (guitar/vocals), Sean Tollefson (bass/vocals) and Jeff Fell (drums).


== History ==
Crayon formed in 1990 in Bellingham, Washington, which is about 60 miles north of Seattle. A bit more punk than twee, Crayon were obviously influenced by bands like Beat Happening and The Modern Lovers. Their sound was a cross between the Seattle based grunge and twee. Many considered their unique style, combining heavily distorted guitar with strong indiepop elements to be the missing link between UK twee bands like The Pastels and American indie bands like Tsunami and the more abrasive Unwound. Some dubbed this new style of music  "love rock," while others referred  to it as "cuddlecore" due to the coy nature of their songs.
In the four years they were together, Crayon  released a handful of 7" singles and one full-length album on Harriet Records. They played a fair amount of live shows across the United States and shared the stage with a number of diverse bands including:  Superchunk, Pavement, Tiger Trap, Built to Spill, The Melvins, Bikini Kill, Karp, Heavens to Betsy, Alan Clapp, Seaweed, Hazel, The Cows, Ed's Redeeming Qualities, Some Velvet Sidewalk, cub, Nothing Painted Blue, The Stinkypuffs, Engine Kid, Mecca Normal, Unwound, Southern Culture on the Skids, New Bad Things, Henry's Dress, Unsane, The Crabs, Smog, Lois, New Bomb Turks and The Softies.
Even though the trio only recorded one album and were never commercially successful, some critics have cited Crayon as one of the most influential bands to come out of the sleepy college town of Bellingham, Washington. Roberts left the group in 1994 and Tollefson & Fell went on to form the seminal indie pop band Tullycraft in 1995.
In 2014 HHBTM Records reissued the album, Brick Factory, on limited edition vinyl and cassette to commemorate the 20th anniversary of its release.

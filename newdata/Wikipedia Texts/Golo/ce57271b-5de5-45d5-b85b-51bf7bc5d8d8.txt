Gollo people

The Gollo are an ethnic group living in the South Sudanese state of Western Bahr el Ghazal.  The area occupied by the Gollo lies to the west of the town of Wau and is delimited by Deil Zubier (North), the source of the Mbomo river (East), the confluence of the Wara river (West) and the Kpango river (south). The most important settlements are Kayango, Abushakka, Manga.
The society is mainly agrarian, with little trade with neighboring tribes.
The tribe has been plagued by multiple upheavals that has seen their numbers reduced to several thousands in recent times and has eroded their political organization.

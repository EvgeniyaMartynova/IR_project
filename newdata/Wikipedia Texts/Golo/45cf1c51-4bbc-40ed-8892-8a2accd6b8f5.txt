Golo Footwear is a fashion company established in 1915 by Adolf Heilbrunn, who was from Germany. Golo initially designed and manufactured slippers in Dunmore, Pennsylvania. The company was known for experimenting with materials not traditionally used in footwear, such as cork, stretch fabrics, Gore-Tex for rainboots, and clear lucite sandal wedges.There are presently 22 Golo boots, shoes, and sandals in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, including an over-the-knee boot made of different-colored patent leather zip-on layers,  stretch patent leather boots designed for Jacques Tiffeau in 1967, and the denim platform boots designed by Leila Larmon and Stephen Bruce.

Golo (department)

Golo was a department of France from 1793 to 1811.  It was located in the northern and eastern parts of the island of Corsica.  The capital was Bastia. The department was named after the river Golo.
Golo was created in 1793 by the division of the former department of Corse, which covered the whole island. Corse was reconstituted in 1811 by re-merging Golo with Liamone.

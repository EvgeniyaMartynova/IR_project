Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs

A number of cabinet committees are set up by the Prime Minister of India as per the need and requirement. They are extra constitutional as they do not find mention in the constitution.
Cabinet committee on Political affairs(CCPA) is set up and chaired by the Prime minister and often described as 'Super cabinet' as it is the most important of all. Political affairs committee deals with all policy matters pertaining to domestic and foreign affairs.
Also CCPA is enjoined to deal with policy matters concerning foreign affairs that do not have external or internal security implications, as matters with such implications are required to be dealt with by the Cabinet committee on Security(CCS).

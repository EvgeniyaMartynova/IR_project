Turmoil is inspired by the 19th century oil rush in North America. The player has to earn their way to become a successful oil entrepreneur. As the player make money digging up and selling oil, the town will grow along with them, allowing the player to buy upgrades, such as more horses or bigger pipes.

The player goes up against three rival AIs in each level.

California's 12th congressional district

California's 12th congressional district is a congressional district in California.
Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, has represented the district since January 2013.
Currently, the 12th district is entirely within the city of San Francisco.
Prior to redistricting by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission of 2011, the 12th district consisted of portions of both San Mateo County and San Francisco.  It is the smallest district by area outside New York City.


== History ==
When the 12th Congressional District was created after the 1930 Census, it was located in Los Angeles County. As California's population grew, however, the district generally was moved northward, eventually to the San Francisco peninsula.)
Richard Nixon, who would subsequently serve as the 37th president of the United States, represented this district from 1947-1951. Nancy Pelosi, the former 52nd speaker of the House and current speaker of the House, is the current representative of this district, after previously serving California's 8th Congressional district between 1993-2013.

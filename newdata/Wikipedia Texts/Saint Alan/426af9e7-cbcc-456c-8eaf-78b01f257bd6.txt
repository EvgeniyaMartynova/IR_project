Alan of Lavaur

Saint Alan of Lavaur (French: Alain or Ã‰lan de Lavaur) is the saint to whom Lavaur Cathedral (Tarn, France) is dedicated.
His feast day is 25 November.
He is assumed to be a bishop and dated to the 7th century, but there is very little if any corroboration available, and it has been suggested that Alan of Lavaur may be nothing more than a pale reflection of the well-known Amand of Maastricht.

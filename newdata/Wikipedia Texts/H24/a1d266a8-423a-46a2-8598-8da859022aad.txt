The Lioré et Olivier LeO H.242 was a French-manufactured flying boat that was used for European passenger air services in the 1930s. Several were operated by Air France.

== Variants ==
H-24.01
First prototype. Powered by two 373 kW (500 hp) Renault 12Jb engines. One built.
H-241
The initial four-engined long-range heavy-weight variant of the H-24. The hull was almost exclusively made of anodised Duralumin, for corrosion resistance. Although construction began before the H.242, the sole H.241 was completed later, but did not enter production.
H-242
Initial production. Powered by four Gnome-Rhône 7Kd Titan Major radial engines. Two were built for Air France and delivered in December 1933 and February 1934. They could carry ten passengers.
H-242/1
Revised production version, with a modified engine installation. Twelve were built for Air France and delivered between March 1935 and May 1937, carrying twelve passengers. Most H.242/1s were fitted with wide chord NACA cowlings over the front engine only, but some aircraft were fitted with narrow chord Townend rings around the front engine.
H-243
an un-built projected version for the French navy with enlarged hull.
H-244
A projected high-speed inter-continental flying boat for Air Union, abandoned when Air Union was absorbed by Air France.
H-246
A major redesign, the four engines now all in tractor configuration.

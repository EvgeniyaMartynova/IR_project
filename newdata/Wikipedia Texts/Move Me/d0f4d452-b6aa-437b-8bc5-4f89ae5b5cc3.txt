Move Me (Midge Ure album)

Move Me, released 25th September 2000, is the fifth solo album by former Ultravox frontman Midge Ure. Ure produced, arranged  and recorded it almost entirely at home. It was released by BMG Records in continental Europe and was not released in the UK until 14th May 2001 by Curb Records. It was also released in the U.S. by Koch Records. "Move Me" was later re-released 2006, by the German Record label Hypertension, as "Move Me+" with a bonus CD featuring two instrumental tracks called "Higher" and "Fall" plus live tracks from 2000, radio sessions and acoustic versions. Promo-videos were made for  "You Move Me" and "Beneath A Spielberg Sky" and they were both released as singles.Ure said about the album in 2000: "If Ultravox had carried on I would like to think that this is probably how they would sound now. It's dark, it's interesting, it's melodic, it's got very interesting sounds."  
"The Refugee Song" was inspired by the refugee crisis in Kosovo 1999.

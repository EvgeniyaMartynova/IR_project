DUX submachine gun

The DUX-53 and DUX-59 were submachine guns designed at the Oviedo Arsenal in Spain. They were based directly on the design of the Finnish 9mm Model 44 submachine gun, which in turn was based on the Soviet PPS-43. A large number of these weapons were produced for the West German Border Guard, and was later licensed to be produced by Ansch√ºtz and Mauser until the mid-1950s.

Hello Again (The Cars song)

"Hello Again" is a song performed by the rock band the Cars, released in 1984 as the fourth single from the album Heartbeat City. It was the fourth Top 20 hit from the album, reaching number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; it also reached number 8 on the Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart and number 22 on the Mainstream Rock chart.


== Music video ==
The music video for the song was directed by Andy Warhol, who also appeared in the video as a bartender. A then-unknown Gina Gershon also appeared in the video. Keyboardist Greg Hawkes said "I think [Warhol] mainly did some of the conceptualizing and showed up to be an extra. And he invited his various friends to be in it. It was like any video shoot, but with a more interesting cast of characters. And you could always look over on the set and go 'Hey that's Andy Warhol.'"The music video explored the controversial topics of sex and violence (mostly the former) that were being featured in music videos at the time.


== Reception ==
"Hello Again" was described as "eccentric" by AllMusic critic Greg Prato, who also cited the track as a highlight from the Heartbeat City album. Donald Guarisco, also of AllMusic, said, "One of their strongest tracks [on Heartbeat City with experimental roots] was 'Hello Again,' a stylish new wave rocker with plenty of experimental touches." Guarisco also said it "is a song that represents the Cars striking a unique balance between their gift for pop hooks and their love of experimental sounds."In his review of the compilation album Greatest Hits, Greg Prato felt that "Hello Again" should have appeared, stating "why was the title track from Heartbeat City (an unsuccessful single) included instead of the 1984 Top 20 hit 'Hello Again'?"

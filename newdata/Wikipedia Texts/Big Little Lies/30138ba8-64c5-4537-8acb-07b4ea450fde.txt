=== Development ===
On August 6, 2014, it was announced Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon had optioned the screen rights to Liane Moriarty's novel Big Little Lies. The actresses were expected to develop the project as a film in which they would both star. Bruna Papandrea and Per Saari were set to executive produce alongside Kidman and Witherspoon. Moriarty was also expected to produce as well. On November 25, 2014, it was announced that Kidman and Witherspoon had decided to develop the project into a limited television series instead of the originally planned film. Additionally, it was announced that television series would be written by David E. Kelley. On May 8, 2015, it was announced that HBO had given the production a series order and that in addition to writing, Kelley would also executive produce. On October 23, 2015, it was reported that Jean-Marc Vallée was in talks to direct the first episode of the series with the potential to direct more. On December 17, 2015, it was announced that Vallée would direct all seven episodes of the series. On November 28, 2016, it was announced that the series would premiere on February 19, 2017.The show was initially conceived of and billed as a miniseries of seven episodes. In the wake of the Emmy nominations, Reese Witherspoon said: "As of right now, I think it's pretty whole. I feel really good about where it is, and if this is all it ever was, it's a beautiful thing we all accomplished together", while Vallée came out strongly against the idea of producing a second season: "There's no reason to make a season two. That was meant to be a one-time deal, and it's finishing in a way where it's for the audience to imagine what can happen. If we do a season two, we'll break that beautiful thing and spoil it". Later, when the show garnered an array of critical accolades, he changed his mind: "It'd be great to reunite the team and to do it. Are we going to be able to do it, altogether? I wish."


=== Second season ===
In July 2017, two weeks after the series was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series, HBO revealed that a second season was possible, and that Moriarty had been asked to write a story for it. In December 2017, after the Critics' Choice Television Award and Golden Globe Award nomination voting periods were over, HBO officially renewed the series for a seven-episode second season to be written by Kelley, directed by Andrea Arnold, and based on a new novella by Moriarty. Vallée remains an executive producer of the series. Meryl Streep joined the cast as the mother of Alexander Skarsgård's character.The announcement of the second season, and—specifically—its timing, enraged the producers of rival shows that were competing for award nominations in the limited series category, particularly since the announcement was made after voting for the Critics' Choice Awards and Golden Globe Awards had ended. The Producers Guild of America restarted voting for the 2018 PGA Awards, reclassifying the show from a limited series to a drama series.In July 2019, it was reported by IndieWire that director Andrea Arnold lost creative control after filming had completed, and it was given to season 1 director Jean-Marc Vallée in an attempt to unify the style between the seasons. Arnold was initially promised by HBO that the show would be done in her vision, including post-production, and was unaware that Vallée would edit the footage she had shot. Once Vallée completed his work on Sharp Objects, he took over the editing process along with his own editorial team in Montreal. HBO also ordered 17 more days of additional photography, to be filmed by Arnold, but were overseen by Vallée. Significant reworking of the episodes also took place, where episodes were shortened. In response, HBO programming president Casey Bloys stated, "There's a lot of misinformation around that subject" and "the director typically does not have final creative control". Bloys clarified that Vallée came back to "hone the episodes" after being asked by the entire producing team, including Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, and that they were clear with Arnold about how the process would work from the start.


=== Future ===
HBO president Casey Bloys said a third season of the show was "not realistic" due to scheduling the show's actors. However, Bloys mentioned that HBO is more than willing to greenlight a third season if the cast are able to work out their schedules.

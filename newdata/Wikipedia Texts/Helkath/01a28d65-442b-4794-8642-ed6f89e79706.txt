=== Adadah ===
Adadah is the name of a town mentioned in Joshua 15:22, in a list of towns inside the territory of the Tribe of Judah. The name "Adadah" appears nowhere else in the Bible. According to the Encyclopaedia Biblica, the name "Adadah" may be a miswritten version of Ararah, a name equivalent to "Aroer".

=== Arah of the Sidonians ===
Arah of the Sidonians is a place-name which appears in Joshua 13:4. Other translations render the name Mearah. The initial syllable me- here is commonly interpreted as a preposition, yielding the translation "from Arah" instead of "Mearah". The me- is also interpreted as "from" by Thomas Kelly Cheyne, although he additionally proposed that further scribal error had influenced the word.


=== Arumah ===
Arumah is a location mentioned in Judges 9:41, as the place where Gideon's son Abimelech lived for a time. The location is generally considered to be the same as the modern Jebel el-Urmah.


=== Ascent of Luhith ===

== B ==


=== Beer ===
Beer was a location reached by the Israelites during their Exodus journey, mentioned in Numbers 21:16-18. After the death of Aaron, the Israelites moved on, apparently at pace, through a series of locations along the Moabite/Amorite border. There was a well at Beer, where Moses was able to assemble and refresh the travelling community, and which was associated with a song regarding the Israelite leaders and 'the lawgiver' in providing water.
Another Beer (or Bera)  is mentioned in Judges 9:21 as the place to which Gideon's youngest son, Joatham or Jotham, fled to escape from Abimelech after his 69 brothers had been killed. Matthew Poole described Beer as "a place remote from Shechem, and out of Abimelech’s reach"; and the Pulpit Commentary suggests it is "either the same as Beeroth, among the heights of the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 9:17), now El-Birch, 'the first halting-place for caravans on the northern road from Jerusalem' (Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine', p. 210); or a place called by Eusebius 'Beta', now El-Birch, eight Roman miles from Eleutheropolis (now Beit Jibrin), and possibly the same as the place of the same name described by Maundrell as four hours from Jerusalem, and two hours west of Bethel; or, as Ewald thinks, Beer beyond Jordan (Numbers 21:16 - see above)". The commentary concludes that "it is impossible to decide which, or whether any, of these is the place designated as Jotham's place of refuge.


=== Beer-lahai-roi ===
Beer-lahai-roi or well of the Life which saw me is the name of a well in the Negev which is known for its appearance in a story in which God appears to Hagar. Later the Book of Genesis claims that Isaac stayed near it. Genesis locates this well in the wilderness of Beer-sheba, "on the way to Shur ... between Kadesh and Bered".it Because the Beer in Beer-lahai-roi is simply the Hebrew word "well", the King James Version renders the whole expression "the well Lahairoi".
The biblical references to it may place it somewhere in the vicinity of the modern Bir 'Asluj.


=== Beeroth ===
A minor city in [[Gibeon] in Joshua 9:17. 


=== Beon ===
Beon is a location mentioned only in Numbers 32:3. It may be a copying error for "Meon".


=== Bera ===
An alternative name for Beer (Judges 9:21)


=== Bered ===
Bered is a location mentioned only in Genesis 16:14, which locates Hagar between Kadesh and Bered at the time of her meeting with an angel while pregnant.

=== Beth Jeshimoth ===
Beth Jeshimoth (Hebrew, Beit ha-Yeshimot) was a town in the Transjordan, which is mentioned in four verses of the Hebrew Bible: Numbers 33:49, Joshua 12:3 and 13:20, and Ezekiel 25:9. Numbers mentions it in a description of where the Israelites encamped during their wilderness journeys. According to Joshua 13:20, it was part of the land allocated to the Tribe of Reuben. Ezekiel 25:9 lists it as one of three cities which constitute "the glory of the country" of Moab, in a passage in which God promises to punish Moab. During the First Jewish-Roman War, Beth Jeshimoth (Bezemoth) was captured by the Roman Imperial army, and was used by them to resettle deserters who had joined the Roman ranks.The King James Version spells the name as Bethjesimoth and Bethjeshimoth. Classical Greek sources: Bezemoth


=== Beth Lebaoth ===
Beth Lebaoth or Lebaoth is located in the Negev, and in territory which according to the Book of Joshua was assigned to the Tribe of Simeon.


=== Beth Pelet ===
Beth Pelet (spelled Bethpalet and Bethphelet in the King James Version) was a location in the territory assigned to the Tribe of Judah by Joshua 15:27, and was occupied by Judahites in Yehud Medinata following the return from the Babylonian captivity according to Nehemiah 11:26. Its location is not certain, but may have been along the southern edge of Judah near the border with Edom.

=== Camon ===
Camon, Kamon or Camoun was the place where the biblical judge Jair was buried (Judges 10:5). It was a city of Gilead according to Josephus, and in the opinion of the editors of the Pulpit Commentary: "Polybius mentions a Camoun among other trans-Jordanic places, but its site has not been verified by modern research". However, Easton disagrees:

It has usually been supposed to have been a city of Gilead, on the east of Jordan.


=== Carem ===
Carem appears in the Septuagint version of the Book of Joshua (Joshua 15:59-60)


=== Casiphia ===
Casiphia or Kasiphia is a place-name found only in Ezra 8:17, referring to an unknown location in Babylon. Ezra is recorded as having gotten Levites from Casiphia in order to serve in the temple of Jerusalem.

== D ==


=== Diblah ===
Diblah (also called Diblath) is a place-name found in Ezekiel 6:14. It is probably a variant form of the name Riblah.


=== Dilean ===
Dilean is a place-name found in Joshua 15:38, in a list of locations allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Shephelah. The site is unknown, but from the position of the town in the list, it would appear to be somewhere north of Tel Lachish and Eglon.


=== Dimonah ===
Dimonah is a place listed in Joshua 15:22 as being inside the territory of Judah along its southern border with Edom. It may be the same as Dibon.


=== Dura ===
The "plain of Dura" is a location mentioned in Daniel 3:1, as the place where the king of Babylon built an image of himself. The location is uncertain, as there were several places named Dura in the region.


== E ==


=== Eglaim ===
Eglaim is a Moabite city mentioned by Isaiah in his proclamation against Moab (Isaiah 15:8). Its location is unknown.


=== Elealeh ===
Elealeh was a Moabite town. Every time it is mentioned in the Bible, Heshbon is mentioned as well. The Book of Numbers assigns Elealeh to the Tribe of Reuben. Thomas Kelly Cheyne believed that where the present Hebrew text of Isaiah 15:8 reads Beer Elim, the original likely read b- [Hebrew preposition "in"] Elealeh. Today the location of the biblical Elealeh is called el-ʿAl.


=== Eleph ===
Eleph is the name given in Joshua 18:28, apparently for a town in territory of the Tribe of Benjamin. Because the name "Eleph" means thousand, and because the form found in Joshua is in Hebrew ha-eleph, literally, "the thousand," Thomas Kelly Cheyne believed there was an error in the text, and that ha-eleph was a copyist's mistake for either Taralah or Irpeel. Another understanding of the word is that it is part of a compound name for a town called Zela Haeleph, instead of "Zela" and "Eleph" being two distinct towns, as in the King James Version.


=== Elon-beth-hanan ===
Elon-beth-hanan (sometimes written Elonbethhanan, Elonbeth-hanan, Elon Bethhanan, etc.) is apparently the name of a place recorded in 1 Kings 4:9. 1 Kings 4 asserts that Solomon, king of Israel, divided his kingdom into twelve administrative districts, each with a governor responsible for delivering taxation from the region to the king. The region assigned to a Ben-Deker is recorded as including Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan. Instead of beth, some manuscripts read ben, the Hebrew word for "son of," yielding the reading "Elon son of Hanan." Instead of "Elon-beth-hanan," the Septuagint reads "and Elon as far as Beth-hanan", a reading endorsed as "probably right" by the Encyclopaedia Biblica, although the Encyclopaedia expresses doubt as to whether "Beth-hanan" is correct.


=== Elon-meonenim ===
See Meonenim.


=== Eltolad ===
Eltolad is a location in Canaan mentioned in the Book of Joshua. Joshua 15:30 considers it a part of the territory of Judah in the Negev along the southern border with Edom, but Joshua 19:4 treats it as part of the territory of the Tribe of Simeon. 1 Chronicles 4:29 refers to it as "Tolad."


=== Enam ===
Enam, according to Joshua 15:34, was a town in the Shephelah of the Tribe of Judah. It may be the same location as the Enaim where, in the narrative found in the book of Genesis, Tamar seduced the patriarch Judah.


=== En-eglaim ===
En-eglaim (Eneglaim, En Eglaim) is a location mentioned in a vision of the prophet Ezekiel. According to his vision, the Dead Sea (a salty lake in which fish cannot live) would one day be filled with fresh water, and fishers would cast their nets "from Engedi to En-eglaim." According to Thomas Kelly Cheyne (1899), a likely theory would be that the place referred to is near where the Jordan River empties into the Dead Sea, resulting in the freshwater fish washed into the Dead Sea dying of the excessive salt content and washing up dead on the beach. Cheyne suggested Ain Hajleh (Ain Hajlah) as a possible location, thinking that the Hebrew Eglaim might be a later version in a text which originally read "Hoglah," as in the place-name "Beth-hoglah." At present the exact location is still unidentified, though proposals include Ain Hajlah, Ain Feshka, or Eglaim.


=== En-gannim ===
En-gannim is the name of two towns mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.
A town in the Shephelah of Judah, according to Joshua 15:34.
A town in the territory of the Tribe of Issachar, according to Joshua 19:21. See also Anem.


=== En-haddah ===
En-haddah is a town mentioned only once in the Bible, in Joshua 19:21, where it is assigned to the territory of the Tribe of Issachar. Due to its placement in a list of towns, it would appear to be close to En-gannim, which immediately precedes it.


=== En-hakkore ===
En-hakkore is the name of a fountain, mentioned only in Judges 15:18-19. In the biblical narrative, Samson the Israelite hero is thirsty, and calls (kara) to God in fear that he will die of thirst. In response, God causes a spring to miraculously appear. Samson memorializes the incident by naming the spring En Hakkore, Hebrew for "spring of the caller." According to Encyclopaedia Biblica, the original etymology of En-hakkore is "spring of the partridge," while the meaning "spring of the caller" is a later legendary invention.


=== Ephratha ===
Ephratha (Bethlehem); from the Septuagint version of the Book of Joshua (Joshua 15:59-60)


=== Ese ===
Esek is the name of the first of two wells which, according to Genesis, were the object of an argument between Isaac and herdsmen from the Philistine city of Gerar.

=== Eth-kazin ===
Eth-kazin (KJV Ittah-kazin) is the name of a place along the border of the territory of the Tribe of Zebulun, according to Joshua 19:13.


=== Ezel ===
Ezel appears to be the name given to a cairn, rock or milestone in a biblical story concerning David and Jonathan (1 Samuel 20:19). David, the future king of Israel, is a close friend of Jonathan, the son of then-king Saul. Jonathan warns David that Saul may be seeking to kill him, and instructs David to flee. Jonathan instructs David to wait "at the rock Ezel" until Jonathan can understand Saul's intentions, which he will then signal to David so that David can know whether to flee or stay in Saul's court. According to some biblical critics, the word "Ezel" is not a proper noun in Hebrew, and is either a scribal mistake of some kind or a word which is not understood by biblical scholars. The Revised Standard Version refers to it as "yonder stone heap".


== G ==


=== Galeed ===
Galeed, according to Genesis 31:47-48, is the name given by Jacob to the place where he and Laban reached a peace agreement. The name is Hebrew for "heap of witness", and is a reference to the pile of stones erected by Jacob and Laban as a memorial, or "witness", of the agreement between the two relatives. Laban called the stone "Jegar-Sahadutha", the Aramaic equivalent of the Hebrew "Galeed".


=== Gallim ===
Gallim is a biblical place-name. In the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, Gallim is the name of one location, while the Greek Septuagint contains two locations by that name.
In Isaiah 10:30, the village of Gallim is mentioned alongside Laishah (Tel Dan) and Anathoth, placing it somewhere north of Jerusalem. Michal in 1 Samuel, best known for being the wife of David, was briefly the wife of Palti, son of Laish, a man identified as coming from Gallim.An additional Gallim (or Galem) is mentioned in the Septuagint text of 15:59a, which contains additional cities assigned to the tribe of Judah which are not recorded in the Masoretic Text.


=== Gath-rimmon ===
For the biblical town of Gath-rimmon, see its modern name, Tel Gerisa.


=== Gebim ===
Gebim is a biblical place-name which appears only in Isaiah 10:31, in which it is said that "the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee." The location of Gebim is unknown.


=== Gederothaim ===
Gederothaim is a place-name which appears only in Joshua 15:36, in a list of locations possessed by the Tribe of Judah in the Shephelah. Because it appears immediately after the mention of Gederah, some scholars have suggested that "Gederothaim" was introduced by a mistaken copying of the name "Gederah."


=== Geliloth ===
Geliloth is a place-name mentioned in Joshua 18:17, where it describes a location along the boundaries of the territory assigned to the Tribe of Benjamin. The name means "stone-circles."


=== Gibbar ===
Gibbar is a "district of Judah" mentioned in a list of returnees from the Babylonian captivity, where the list claims that 95 of the "sons [i.e. people] of Gibbar" returned.


=== Ginath ===
For the possible place-name Ginath, see List of biblical figures § Ginath.


=== Gittaim ===
Gittaim is a place-name which appears several times in the Hebrew Bible. According to Thomas Kelly Cheyne, "there were probably several Gittaims".
A town called Gittaim in the territory of the Tribe of Benjamin appears in Nehemiah 11:33.
A town called Gittaim is where the Beerothites were accepted as resident aliens according to 2 Samuel 4:3.
Based on readings found in the Greek Septuagint, Cheyne suggested that "Gittaim is also probably the name of a town in or near Edom", referred to in Genesis 36:35 and 1 Chronicles 1:46, where the Hebrew text now reads "Avith".
In the Septuagint, 1 Samuel 14:33 contains a reference to a Gittaim (Greek geththaim), although Cheyne believes the Septuagint's reading here to be a "manifest error".


=== Gur-baal ===
Gur-baal is the name of a place mentioned in 2 Chronicles 26:7. According to the Chronicler, it was inhabited by "Arabians", and was the object of a successful attack by Uzziah, the king of Judah.

=== Hali ===
Hali is mentioned only in Joshua 19:25, in a list of cities assigned to the Tribe of Asher. Stanley Cook believed the name "Hali" may have been a scribal error for "Helbah."


=== Hammath ===
Hammath was one of the fortified cities of Naphtali (Joshua 19:35).


=== Hammon ===
Hammon is the name of two places in the Hebrew Bible. The first is along the borders of the Tribe of Asher. The second is a Levitical city inside the territory of the Tribe of Naphtali, which is probably identical to Hammath and Hammoth-dor.

=== Hamonah ===
Hamonah is a city mentioned in Ezekiel's apocalyptic prophecy, located, according to the text as it now stands, in the "Valley of Hamon-Gog." Thomas Kelly Cheyne expressed doubt as to whether the text originally read "Hamonah," suggesting that scribal error may have obscured a more original reading.


=== Hapharaim ===
Hapharaim or Haphraim is a town listed as being part of the territory of the Tribe of Issachar in the Book of Joshua.


=== Hareth ===
Hareth or Hereth is a forested area in Judah to which David and his family return after leaving refuge in Moab, at the direction of the prophet Gad. It is thought to have been somewhere on the border of the Philistine plain, in the southern part of Judah.


=== Hazar-addar ===
Hazar-addar is a name which appears only in Numbers 34:4, where it refers to a location on the southern edge of the territory belonging to the Tribe of Judah. According to Thomas Kelly Cheyne, the original text of Joshua 15:3 probably contained a reference to the place city.


=== Hazar-enan ===
Hazar-enan (sometimes spelled Hazar Enan or Hazarenan)  is mentioned in Ezekiel 47:17 as a location along the northeastern edge of the land of Canaan according to Ezekiel's "ideal" borders. The Aramaic Targum Jonathan ben Uzziel on Numbers 34:9–10 renders its translation as ṭirath ʿenawatha ("walled suburb of the springs").

Hazor-hadattah, Aramaic for "New Hazor," was a place mentioned in Joshua 15:25, on the border between Judah and the Edom.


=== Heleph ===
Heleph, as the Masoretic Text now stands, appears to be the name of a place located in the territory of the Tribe of Naphtali. It appears only in Joshua 19:33. According to Thomas Kelly Cheyne, the verse appears to have undergone copying errors, and the word "Heleph" was probably not an original part of the verse.


=== Helkath ===
Helkath is a location on the boundary of the tribe of Asher.


=== Helkath-hazzurim ===
Helkath-hazzurim, a term which appears in 2 Samuel 2:16, is the name of a site where the troops of David fought the troops of Ish-bosheth. The location is described as "Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon," although Stanley A. Cook suggested that the words "which is in Gibeon" were a later explanatory note added to the text, and that the story may originally have been set in another location.


=== Hena ===
Hena is the name of a place or nation mentioned only in a single speech in the Hebrew Bible, by the Rabshakeh, an official of Sennacharib, who mentioned it in threatening the Judahites in the time of king Hezekiah. The Rabshakeh warned the Israelites that his employer, the Assyrian Empire, would defeat the kingdom of Judah, and that the Israelites should not trust their deity to save them. He supported his argument by pointing to other places conquered by the Assyrians, and pointed out that the gods of those locations had not managed to prevent conquest. "Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?" The locations of Hena and Ivvah are unknown to the present day. Thomas Kelly Cheyne suggested that the name "Hena" has found its way into the verse "through a scribe's error."


=== Hepher ===
Hepher is a place name found in the Hebrew Bible. In the conquest narratives of the Book of Joshua, there is a list of 31 kings defeated by the invading Israelites. These kings are unnamed, but referred to simply in terms of what town they ruled, and a "king of Hepher" is listed among them in Joshua 12:17. Later, in the narratives about Solomon, Solomon divides his land into twelve districts, each ruled by a governor in charge of collecting tribute. The district assigned to the Ben-Hesed included "all the land of Hepher." In addition to these explicit references to a place known as Hepher, there are veiled references to Hepher in etiological genealogical passages, in which historical regions and ethnic groupings are described as if descended from a family tree populated by individual forefathers. In these narratives, a "person" named Hepher is described as being a descendant of Manasseh, indicating that Hepher was, at some point, ruled by people identified with the Tribe of Manasseh. The people of Hepher are identified as "Hepherites" in Numbers 26:32.
The biblical mentions of Hepher are not enough to locate the town with any precision: it is not even certain whether Hepher is to be found in the Transjordan or in Cisjordan.


=== Heshmon ===
Heshmon is the name of a town mentioned in Joshua 15:27, in a list of towns on the border between Judah and Edom. The name Heshmon may be the basis for the term Hasmonean (Hebrew hashmoni), as the Hasmoneans may have had their origin in Heshmon.

=== Hosah ===
Hosah, according to Joshua 19:29, was a city on the border between the Tribe of Asher and Tyre. Where the Masoretic Text reads "Hosah," an important Greek Septuagint manuscript reads "Iaseif," leading to uncertainty about what the original reading was. The location is unknown.


=== Hukkok ===
Hukkok was a town near Zebulun, on the border of Naphtali (Bibleref2|Joshua 19:34}}). Many commentators have identified it with Yaquq.

"But the Amorites were resolved to dwell in Harheres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributary. And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward."1 Kings 4 records that Solomon divided his kingdom into districts under various governors, and chose a man named Ben Deker as governor "in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan".In Joshua 19:42, a Shaalabbin is listed as a location within the territory allotted to Dan, and it is thus likely to be the same as the location "Shaalbim" which Dan was unable to occupy.

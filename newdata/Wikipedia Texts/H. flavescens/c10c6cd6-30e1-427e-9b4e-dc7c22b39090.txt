Hypocnemis flavescens

The Imeri warbling antbird (Hypocnemis flavescens) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is found at lower levels in humid forest in southern Venezuela, south-eastern Colombia and north-western Brazil (west of the Branco River).
The Imeri warbling antbird was described by the English zoologist Philip Sclater in 1865 and given the binomial name Hypocnemis flavescens. Until recently, it was considered a subspecies of Hypocnemis cantator, but based on vocal differences and to a lesser degree differences in plumages it is now treated as a separate species.There are two subspecies:
H. f. flavescens Sclater, PL, 1865 – east Colombia, south Venezuela and northwest Brazil
H. f. perflava Pinto, 1966 – central Roraima in northern BrazilIts conservation status has been assessed by BirdLife International as Least Concern.

Gamma Phi Delta (fraternity)

Gamma Phi Delta (ΓΦΔ) is a national Christian fraternity founded in 1988 at the University of Texas at Austin.  It is composed of several chapters in Texas and other states. The Gamma Phi Delta National Office is located in Fort Worth, Texas and is governed by the National Executive Committee.


== History ==
Gamma Phi Delta Christian Fraternity was founded on March 21, 1988, on the campus of University of Texas at Austin, and incorporated on March 16, 1994.
Kelvin C. James, Curtis Campbell, Rodney Walker, and Dwight Burns conceived the idea to form such an organization, due to what they perceived as a lack of Christian organizations for college-educated men at UT-Austin.
These men, along with Luis Lopez, Eric Wilson, David Porter, Derek Riley, Jeffrey Holmes, James Lee, George Floyd, Michael Satterfield, Alex Bird, Bernard Jackson, Ikless Pettit and Melbourne McDonald, are now known by the members as the "Sixteen Visionaries."
The fraternity originally began as a fellowship and Bible study.  As time progressed, many of the Visionaries were urged to pledge a fraternity.
After attending various interest meetings and parties of the fraternities established on the campus at the time, the Visionaries unanimously voted to establish their own organization in the spring of 1988.


== Vision ==
The vision of Gamma Phi Delta is "to provide an organization of men who have dedicated themselves to Jesus Christ in every aspect of life; who desire to grow and show excellence (1) spiritually, (2) mentally, (3) physically, and (4) socially. Gamma Phi Delta is a fraternity for brothers who choose to be committed to God by taking their communities for Jesus Christ. We will do it through fellowship, evangelism, and discipleship, in return becoming real men, men after God's own heart."

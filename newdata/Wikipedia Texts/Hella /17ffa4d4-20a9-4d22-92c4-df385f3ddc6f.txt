== General information ==

Leikanger was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).  The original municipality was large and it was identical to the old Leikanger parish (prestegjeld) with the six sub-parishes (sokn) of Leikanger, Fresvik, Rinde, Vangsnes, Tjugum, and Mundal.  In 1849, the sub-parishes of Vangsnes, Tjugum, and Mundal were transferred into the newly created Balestrand parish (prestegjeld).  The new parish was separated from Leikanger municipality in 1850 to form the new Balestrand municipality.  This split left Leikanger with 2,368 residents.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the Hella-Eitorn area (population: 31) was transferred from Balestrand back to Leikanger.  Also, the Tingstad area (population: 5) was transferred to neighboring Sogndal municipality.  These changes left Leikanger with 2,680 residents.  On 1 January 1992, the sub-parishes of Leikanger lying south of the Sognefjorden, including Feios and Fresvik (total population: 572) were transferred to the municipality of Vik.  This move left Leikanger with only one sub-parish: Leikanger.On 1 January 2020, the three neighboring municipalities of Balestrand, Leikanger, and Sogndal will merge to form a much larger municipality called Sogndal.


=== Name ===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old farm Leikanger (Old Norse: Leikvangir), since the first Leikanger Church was built there.  The first element is leikr which means "sports" or "athletics" and the last element is the plural form of vangr which means "meadow".  Prior to 1889, the name was written Lekanger.


=== Coat-of-arms ===
The coat-of-arms were granted on 5 September 1963. The arms are green with a yellow-colored apple tree branch with two apples and three leaves attached.  The apple tree branch is a symbol for the many orchards in the municipality and thus for the local economy. The three leaves symbolised the three parishes that used to make up the municipality (before two of them were transferred to Vik in 1992).


=== Churches ===
The Church of Norway has one parish (sokn) within the municipality of Leikanger. It is part of the Indre Sogn deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin.

East Kameng District

Pakke Kessang district is one of the 24 districts of Arunachal Pradesh state in northeastern, India. It shares an international border with Tibet in the north and a state border with Assam and district borders with West Kameng, East Kameng, Papumpare and Kurung Kumey, which was bifurcated from East Kameng district on 1 December 2018.


== History ==
The area around the Kameng river has at various times come under the control and influence of the Mon kingdoms, Tibet and the Ahom kingdom. Aka and Nishi chiefs would exert control over the area whenever no major political powers dominated the area.
The Kameng Frontier Division was renamed as the Kameng District. The Political Officer was also redesignated as the Deputy Commissioner of Kameng. However, for political reasons, the Kameng district was bifurcated between East Kameng and West Kameng on 1 June 1980.


== Geography ==
East Kameng district occupies an area of 4,134 square kilometres (1,596 sq mi), comparatively equivalent to Alaska's Unimak Island.
Like West Kameng, the East Kameng climate ranges from arid in the tundra of the north through a cool temperate climate to a humid subtropical climate in the southern sub-himalayan hills bordering Assam.


== Transport ==
The 2,000-kilometre-long (1,200 mi) proposed Mago-Thingbu to Vijaynagar Arunachal Pradesh Frontier Highway along the McMahon Line, (will intersect with the proposed East-West Industrial Corridor Highway) and will pass through this district, alignment map of which can be seen here and here.


== Economy ==

Most tribes practise a form of slash and burn agriculture known as Jhum.  After clearing the land, crops like barley and rice are planted, and fruit trees are planted to make orchards. Fishing activities first started between 1965–66 and gained momentum in November 1980, when the Fishery Department first started functioning independently. As of today, the Fishery development activities are headed by a District Fishery Development Officer, who was originally the Superintendent of Fisheries. However, this department was understaffed. Funds were also given for rural agriculture and paddy-cum-fish culture activities.
With the advancement of modern technology, horticulture based on apples and oranges is becoming increasingly popular. Today, temperate and sub-tropical fruits are planted in orchards with chemical fertilizers.


== Divisions ==
The district is divided into 2 sub-divisions: Seppa and Chayangtajo, which are further divided into 13 administrative circles, namely, Chayangtajo, Sawa, Khenewa, Bameng, Lada, Gyawe Purang, Pipu, Seppa, Richukhrong, Pijirang, Pakke-Kessang, Seijosa and Dissing Passo.
There are 5 Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly constituencies located in this district: Bameng, Chayangtajo, Seppa East, Seppa West and Pakke-Kasang. All of these are part of Arunachal West Lok Sabha constituency.

=== Population ===

According to the 2011 census East Kameng district has a population of 78,690, roughly equal to the nation of Dominica.  This gives it a ranking of 624th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 19 inhabitants per square kilometre (49/sq mi) . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001–2011 was 37.14%. East Kameng has a sex ratio of 1,012 females for every 1,000 males, and a literacy rate of 62.48%.East Kameng is inhabited by various tribes of similar origin but with distinct cultures and beliefs, practising the Donyi-Polo religion. The most populous of these, the Nishi, are scattered throughout the entire district. Other tribes, especially the Miji, Puroik and the Aka, are found in regions near the Kameng river.
Since independence, much of the population has relocated to the district capital, Seppa. With the coming of modernism, festivals such as the Sarok of the Aka, Nyokum of the Nishi, Jonglam-Ponklam and Chindang of the Miji and the Gumkum-Gumpa are celebrated in full flair in Seppa.


=== Language ===


==== Koro ====

The Koro is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by approximately 800–1200 people in the East Kameng district who live among the Aka (Hruso), but their language is distantly related, with distinct words for basic vocabulary. Although it has resemblances to Tani further to the east, it appears to be a separate branch of Tibeto-Burman. Koro is unlike any language in the various branches of the Tibeto-Burman family. Researchers hypothesize it may have originated from a group of people enslaved and brought to the area.Koro was recognised as a separate language in 2010 by a linguistic team of David Harrison, Gregory Anderson, and Ganesh Murmu while documenting two Hruso languages (Aka and Miji) as part of National Geographic's "Enduring Voices" project. It was apparently noticed by earlier researchers.

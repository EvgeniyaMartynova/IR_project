Villa Juárez, Sonora

Benito Juárez is one of the 72 municipalities (municipios) of the Mexican state of Sonora. It borders with the municipio of Cajeme. The municipal seat is Villa Juárez.


== History ==
The region was settled in the 1940s after the construction of the Angostura Dam and 151 members of the government division of irrigation were given land in the Mayo Valley in place of what would have been compensation with cash.
In 1943 the ex-employees settled in a place they later appropriately named "Colonia Irrigación" ("Irrigation Colony") and later it became dependent on the town (comisaría) Bacobampo until it itself became a town in 1947. In 1957 "Colonia Irrigación" was renamed as Villa Juárez (after president Benito Juárez). Another settlement in the region was called "Sube y Baja" ("up and down") populated by indigenous inhabitants.
In 1996 the region incorporated into a municipio with the name of Benito Juárez. Before this time the town was part of the municipio of Etchojoa.


== Government ==
The presidents of the municipio have been:

Ernesto Cornejo Valenzuela (2003–2006)
María Cristina Carvajal Pak (2000–2003)
Ramón Marquez Vera (1997–2000)
Luis Herrera Portillo (1994–1997)

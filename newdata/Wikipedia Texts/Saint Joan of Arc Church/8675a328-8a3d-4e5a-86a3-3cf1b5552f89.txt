Church of St Joan of Arc

The Church of Saint Joan of Arc (French: L'église Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc) is a Catholic church in the city center of Rouen, northern France.The church of Saint Joan of Arc was completed in 1979 in the center of the ancient market square known as the Place du Vieux-Marché.  This is the place where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake for heresy in 1431. A small garden, Le Bouchet, which is outside and to the north of the church marks the exact spot.  
The modern church Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc and the adjacent market halls were designed by the architect Louis Arretche.  The sweeping curves of the structure are meant to evoke both the flames that consumed Joan of Arc and an overturned longship.  Many early Christian churches were designed in the shape of an overturned boat.  The market halls simultaneously resemble smaller overturned boats and fish with gaping mouths, which are also rich Christian symbols.

The stained glass windows come from the 16th century Church of Saint Vincent, whose ruins are located a few metres away. The old church was almost completely destroyed in 1944 during World War II, but the windows had been removed and stored in a safe location during the war. They were then incorporated into the Church of Saint Joan of Arc. The 13 window panels depict Christ's childhood, Passion, Crucifixion and Resurrection, and life events of St.Peter, St. Anne and Saint Anthony of Padua:

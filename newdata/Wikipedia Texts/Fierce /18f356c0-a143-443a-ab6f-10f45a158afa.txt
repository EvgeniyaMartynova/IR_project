== Controversies ==


=== Lawsuit against Beyoncé ===
On September 27, 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch filed a lawsuit against Beyoncé, because Beyoncé was releasing a fragrance and clothing line called "Sasha Fierce". Abercrombie & Fitch took action by filing a lawsuit   accusing her of trademark infringement, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices because A&F already markets a men's cologne called Fierce. The company also cited a potential likelihood of confusion while sending Beyoncé a warning to "cease-and-desist." In response, Coty, Inc., the company Beyoncé hired for her fragrance, stated that the terms "Fierce" and "Sasha Fierce" were never intended to be used for the fragrance.

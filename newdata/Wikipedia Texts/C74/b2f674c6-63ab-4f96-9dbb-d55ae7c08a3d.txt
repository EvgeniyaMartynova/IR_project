Comiket

Comic Market (コミックマーケット, Komikku Māketto), more commonly known as Comiket (コミケット, Komiketto), is a biannual dōjinshi fair in Tokyo, Japan. A grassroots, DIY event focused on the sale of dōjin (self-published works), Comiket is a not-for-profit, volunteer-run event administered by the Comic Market Preparatory Committee (ComiketPC). Inaugurated on December 21, 1975 with an estimated 700 attendees, it has grown to become the largest fan convention in the world, with an estimated attendance of over half a million.

=== Dōjin marketplace ===
Comiket is focused primarily on the sale of dōjin: non-commercial, self-published works. Approximately 35,000 circles (a term for groups or individuals who create dōjin) participate in each edition of Comiket. Different circles exhibit on each day of Comiket; circles producing works on a common subject, such as a particular media franchise or manga genre, are typically grouped on the same day. The most common item sold at Comkiet is dōjinshi (self-published comics that are often derivative fan works based on anime, video games, and other media), though circles also sell dōjin soft (video games), computer software, music, novels, clothing, and other goods. Since Comiket's inauguration, sample copies of all works sold at Comiket are collected and archived by ComiketPC, with over 2.1 million works having been archived.


==== Trends in derivative works ====


=== Cosplay ===

Comiket is a major outlet for cosplay enthusiasts. Since Comiket 80 in 2011, restrictions on cosplaying have been gradually relaxed, with a shift from regulating objects (e.g. a ban on items that could be used as weapons) to regulating behavior (e.g. a ban on swinging around long objects).


=== Corporate booths ===
Comiket hosts 190 corporate booths each year. This includes both large commercial companies, such as video game studios and manga publishers, as well as celebrity meet and greet sessions.


== Operations ==


=== Schedule ===

Comiket is held twice yearly, in August and December. These are typically referred to as NatsuComi (夏コミ, Natsukomi) and FuyuComi (冬コミ, Fuyukomi), contractions of Summer Comiket and Winter Comiket respectively. Since 1995, both events have run for three days each, with NatsuComi generally occurring Friday to Sunday in mid-August, and FuyuComi generally occurring the three days prior to New Year's Day. Both events run daily from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m, with corporate booths open until 5:00 p.m and the entire convention closing an hour early on the final day of the event. Comiket has been held at Tokyo Big Sight in Ariake, Tokyo since 1996.


==== 2020 Summer Olympics changes ====
In August 2018, ComiketPC announced modified schedules for Comikets 96, 97, and 98 due to the 2020 Summer Olympics. As the East Wing of Big Sight will be closed in 2019 for renovations, the corporate booths of C96 and C97 will be moved to Aomi Exhibition Hall, and both events will expand to four days of programming. C98 in 2020 will be moved to Golden Week in April and May in order to not conflict with the Olympics in August. Furthermore, admission to all three events will require the purchase of a wristband – the first time in Comiket's history it will not be free to attend – in order to offset the cost of running the event across four days, and to depress attendance in light of the smaller venue space. Wristbands for all four days will be included with the purchase of a print event catalog. Individual wristbands will also be available to purchase at Big Sight the day of the event.


=== Event size ===

Comiket is the largest fan convention in the world, growing from fewer than 10,000 attendees in 1982 to over half a million by 2004. Since 2007, attendee numbers have fluctuated in the region of 500,000 for Fuyukomi and 560,000 for NatsuComi. Because of the extremely high volume of attendance at Comiket, mobile phone companies set up temporary antennas, while the Tokyo Metro makes special arrangements to accommodate the large crowds. Hour-long queues to enter Comiket during peak hours are common, while some attendees queue up to five hours before the event to ensure early admission. Popular circles are frequently placed near the venue's loading docks so that their queues can extend outside. ComiketPC recommends that first-time attendees arrive in the afternoon to avoid queues.


=== Catalog ===
For every Comiket, a catalog is released that contains information about the event. The catalog includes a list of all participating circles, maps of the convention layout, directions to and from the convention, rules for the convention, results from surveys held among Comiket participants, articles about topics relevant to dōjinshi creators, and one to two pictures ("circle cuts") for every participating circle. It is available in print and DVD-ROM format, and since Comiket 83, is available online behind a partial paywall.Catalogs are made available for sale at stores two weeks before the event. The print version is roughly the size of an average phone book, while the DVD-ROM version includes features such as advanced search functions and a clickable map. To date, there is no English edition of the catalog available, though the catalog does contain a four-page basic guide for attending Comiket in English, Chinese, and Korean.Prior to Comiket 96, a purchased catalog was not required for admission to Comiket (see 2020 Summer Olympics changes above).


=== Participants ===

The overwhelming majority of Comiket circle participants are amateur and hobbyist artists: 70% of participating circles lose money, while only 15% turn a profit. The majority of circle participants at Comiket are female, with women composing 57% of participating circles at Comiket 84. General attendees at Comiket tend to skew male, with men comprising 64% of attendees at Comiket 78.


=== Philanthropy ===
Since 1993, ComiketPC has donated over ¥60 million to sustainable forest management to offset paper used in the production of dōjinshi. Since 2007, ComiketPC has worked with the Japanese Red Cross Society to organize bloodmobiles at Comiket events.


== History ==

Comiket was inaugurated in 1975 by Meikyu, a dōjin circle founded by Yoshihiro Yonezawa, Teruo Harada, and Jun Aniwa while studying at Meiji University. The first Comiket was organized amid a period of immense change and upheaval for manga as a medium, characterized by the closure of the experimental manga magazine COM and the ascendance of the Year 24 Group. A 1975 incident in which a dōjin creator applying for Nihon SF Taikai  was refused admission after criticizing the convention's focus on professional guests over dōjin creators in her application became a catalyst for the founding of Comiket as a fan convention.As Comiket grew, a lottery system to allocate exhibition space was implemented in 1979, as the number of applications from circles began to surpass available space. In 1981 the event moved to Harumi Fairgrounds and began publishing an event catalog in 1982. Comiket would change locations frequently throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, as the Japanese bubble economy led to an upsurge in trade shows that made it difficult to secure a consistent venue. The murders by Tsutomu Miyazaki and subsequent moral panic against otaku would lead to further difficulties in Comiket's ability to secure a venue. Tokyo Big Sight hosted Comiket for the first time in 1996, and remains the convention's primary venue.
In 2012, anonymous threats made against circles creating works related to Kuroko's Basketball led Comiket to prohibit the sale of all Kuroko's Basketball-related items at Comiket 85 (see Kuroko's Basketball § Controversies). Organizers refunded the registration fees for the roughly 900 circles producing Kuroko's Basketball items, resulting in a loss for Comiket of roughly ¥10 million. In 2015, ComiketPC organized a special event specifically focused on doujinshi related to the series. Affectionately nicknamed "Kuroket", the event hosted approximately 2,400 circles producing Kuroko's Basketball items.

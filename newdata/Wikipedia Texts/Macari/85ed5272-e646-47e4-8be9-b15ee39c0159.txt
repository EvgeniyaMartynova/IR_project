San Vito lo Capo

San Vito Lo Capo (Sicilian: Santu Vitu) is a town and comune in North-Western Sicily, Italy, administratively part of the province of Trapani.  The small town is located in a valley between  mountains, and is home to a public beach that is destination of local vacationers. The town's primary industries are tourism and agriculture, particularly olive groves owned by small farmers.
The town's eastern border is provided by a small range of mountains, the northernmost of which is peaked by a large cross visible from the public beach below.  The mountain is  home to numerous caves, most of which are inaccessible without professional climbing gear. A  cave, accessible by foot at the southern base of the mountain, was named "Caverna della Capra Guasto," or "Cave of the Dead Goat" by explorers Christian D'Angelo and William Spears.  
To the south is the Riserva naturale dello Zingaro. Other sights include the sanctuary-fortress, the chapel of Santa Crescenzia, the  historical lighthouse, several tonnaras and the Torre dell'Usciere, a coastal watchtower. 
San Vito Lo Capo is a well-known rock climbing destination. Along the coast on the west side of San Vito lo Capo is a coastal cliff nearly 4 km long.

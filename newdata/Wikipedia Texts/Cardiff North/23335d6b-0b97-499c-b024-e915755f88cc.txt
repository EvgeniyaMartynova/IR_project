Cardiff North (UK Parliament constituency)

Cardiff North (Welsh: Gogledd Caerdydd) is a
UK constituency in the city of Cardiff represented since 2017 by Anna McMorrin of the Labour party. Since its 1950 creation it returns one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the UK Parliament.  The affiliation of the winning candidate for Cardiff North was that of the winning party nationally for the years 1979-2015 – a bellwether seat.
Cardiff North is one of four seats won (held or gained) by a Labour candidate in 2017 from a total of five covering its county. McMorrin's 2017 win was one of 30 net gains of the Labour Party.
The seat has been relative to others a marginal seat since 2001 as well as a swing seat as its winner's majority has not exceeded 8% of the vote since the 14.3% majority won in that year. The seat has changed political allegiance twice since that year.


== History ==
This seat is the residential quarter of Wales' capital, over half of northern Cardiff consists of owner-occupied housing, with a higher number of a middle class population than other sections. Historically it has mainly elected Conservative MPs, but with new housing development Welsh Labour has overturned the nominal majority more recently, turning the seat into a national target swing-constituency. By 2004, the Conservatives held a majority of councillors within the district (13, against five Liberal Democrats, three independents and no Labour), but in the following 2005 general election Welsh Labour's Julie Morgan retained the seat but with a reduced majority.
BBC News political editor Nick Robinson profiled the constituency as part of the BBC's build-up to the 2010 general election: saying:

Morgan stood again for Welsh Labour in 2010, whilst the Conservatives chose Jonathan Evans MEP, who had previously been the MP for Brecon and Radnor. Evans won by 194 votes.
In 2015, Labour attempted to take the seat back but new candidate, Craig Williams, took it with a surprising majority of 2,137. Many had expected it to be very close run again. Labour retook the seat in 2017 on a 6.1% swing, producing a majority of 4,174; this was the first time in the seat's history it had voted for a Labour candidate in an election they did not win and the first time it elected an MP who is not a member of the largest party in the House of Commons since October 1974.

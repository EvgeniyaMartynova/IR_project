== Reception ==
In his review on Allmusic, Ken Dryden states "Houston Person is a very versatile veteran tenor saxophonist who tends to get overlooked in critics' polls, yet his extensive musical resumé is ample proof that he is a jazz master. This 2011 session ranges from a duet to septet, with everyone playing compact solos, keeping all but one under the six-minute mark, a lost art in modern jazz. ... Highly recommended". On All About Jazz, Greg Simmons noted " Houston Person isn't breaking any new ground with So Nice. He doesn't have to. He does what he does, and he does it really well".

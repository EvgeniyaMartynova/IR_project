Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis

Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis is a potentially fatal disorder with multiple cutaneous and systemic hemangiomas. The most common site of internal organ involvement is the liver. Death can result from high-output cardiac failure as a result of arteriovenous shunting. Early detection and treatment with steroids results in most patients remaining healthy, with serious problems developing for some patients during the hemangioma's growth phase.

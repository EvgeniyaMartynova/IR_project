== Biography ==
Parkhouse has been in comics since 1967, when he was drawing the occasional 'Power House Pin-Up' of Marvel superheroes for the back covers of Fantastic and Terrific, two British weeklies published by Odhams. In 1969 his first professional writing assignments appeared when he co-wrote two Marvel Comics stories, one starring the jungle lord Ka-Zar in Marvel Super-Heroes No. 19 (March 1969), and the other starring the eponymous superspy in Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. No. 12 (May 1969).
He also contributed a story for Western Gunfighters No. 4 (February 1970), pencilled by Barry Windsor-Smith
Since then he has worked on a wide range of titles from 2000 AD to Warrior and various Marvel UK titles.
His work includes "Big Dave" (with Mark Millar and Grant Morrison) in 2000 AD, The Bojeffries Saga with Alan Moore, Night Raven with David Lloyd and various strips in Doctor Who Magazine.  He illustrated three Dr. Who episodes in 1982–83.
In 2004 he provided the art for Angel Fire, which was written by Chris Blythe (better known for his colouring work). This was published by Shattered Frames, a company they established in the same year to produce British graphic novels. In the same year he also drew writer Joe Casey's miniseries Milkman Murders, published by Dark Horse Comics. Since 2011, he has been working with Peter Hogan on the Dark Horse comic Resident Alien.

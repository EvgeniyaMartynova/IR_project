== Rail transport ==

Purna Junction railway station (station code: PAU) is on the Kachiguda-Manmad section of Nanded (NED) Division of South Central Railway (SCR). In the meter gauge era Purna was the most important Junction.  Hundreds of railway employees were then stationed at Purna.   Nearly 50% of the population of the Purna city then was constituted with railway employees and their families.  Purna has massive land occupied by the Railway Department for staff quarters, filling point, washing area, etc. Railway Department has its own schools in Marathi and English, community cultural hall, sports complexes, and fields.  The economy of the city was mainly dependent of the railway population. All the trains then would halt here for 20 minutes to  90 minutes.  The crew would change here and fueling/watering to the trains would be done here. The engines of the majority trains would be changed here then. The railway population had then enriched the sports culture of the city.  After creation of the Nanded division, all major major operations of railways were diverted from Purna junction to Nanded.  Since then the city lost its prosperity and the economy of the city had an enormous adverse effect on it.   After Divisional adjustments in 2003, Purna now comes under the Nanded (NED) Division of SCR.

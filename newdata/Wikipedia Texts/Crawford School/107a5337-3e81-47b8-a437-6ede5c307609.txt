Anderson, initially with a capacity of 600, had it increase to 900 as a new wing opened in 1963.

In 1996 there were 1,500 students; an additional 300 had been re-assigned to other schools. In 1998 the school had almost 1,600 students.

Benavidez Elementary School, which opened on Tuesday January 21, 1992, relieved Cunningham of around 675 students and 29 teachers. Benavidez, along with two other schools, was a part of a $370 million Houston ISD school construction project, which originated from a school bond approved in March 1989. Rose Garza, the principal of Benavidez, said that the committee determining the name of the school named it after Roy P. Benavidez, a soldier in the Vietnam War who was given the Medal of Honor, because the school wanted to name the school after a Hispanic who could serve as a positive role model to the mostly Hispanic student body that occupied the school when it opened. HISD officials said that the district had little difficulty opening the three schools in the middle of the year, since the same teachers had been teaching the same students while they occupied the previously overcrowded schools in the preceding fall. On its opening day Benavidez referred 400 students to other schools due to overcrowding. After Benavidez opened, Benavidez and Cunningham each had about 700 students. In 1994, Benavidez had 1,065 pupils and it had to send 200 children to different schools. As of that year, 88% of Benavidez's children were Hispanic. By 1996, both Cunningham and Benavidez became overcrowded.

The school, first opened in 1912, was named after John Edward Durkee, a man from New York State who purchased an area he named "Little York" (after New York State) and sold land to the Harris County School District #25. The first Durkee school, a four-room, red-brick building, was developed on that land, which is now the site of Fonville Middle School.

In fall 1954 the current campus opened; the original Durkee building was initially closed but reopened to house some primary school classes in the middle of the 1954-1955 school year.

West University Elementary School opened sometime around 1928; originally Pershing Middle School was connected to WUES; Pershing later obtained its own campus in Houston in 1948.  In the 1970s and 1980s West University parents reshaped a school which Tim Fleck of the Houston Press described as "deteriorating" into "a community focal point that kept many West U children in public school through the fifth grade." West University Elementary School as, by the 1990s, became what Fleck described as "the prototype of how the increasingly minority district could maintain the allegiance of affluent whites" and "a selling point for parents moving into the area." The Rice School opened in August 1994 to relieve West University Elementary School and several nearby campuses. As a result, the attendance boundary was shifted, and the school began serving all of Sunset Terrace/Montclair; previously a portion of that community was zoned to West University, with the other portion zoned to Will Rogers. In 1996 37% of West University Elementary students had transferred there from other schools. In 2015 West U Elementary had 1,274 students, making it HISD's largest elementary school, with 96% of the students living inside the attendance zone.

About 100 of the around 300 students were homeless, and about 30 came from a Salvation Army shelter. Flores said that this was the highest number of homeless students during his career as a principal at Jones. In 2008 99% of the students were on free or reduced lunch. Every year the school held its "Gift of Giving" ceremony.
Before the start of the 2009-2010 school year Jones was consolidated into Blackshear Elementary School, a campus in the Third Ward. During its final year of enrollment J. Will Jones had more students than Blackshear. Many J. Will Jones parents referred to Blackshear as "that prison school" and said that they will not send their children to Blackshear. Jones was scheduled to house Houston Community College classes after its closure as a school. Supporters of keeping J. Will Jones created a campaign to try to keep J. Will Jones open. The Jones campus became the campus of Houston Academy for International Studies. Blackshear and Gregory-Lincoln elementary took portions of J. Will Jones's former territory in Midtown.

According to Lisa Sacaris, the educational liaison of the Cottage Grove Civic Association, the school had a capacity of around 450 students. Around 2007, the school district considered closing Stevenson. Sacaris added that the school was just beginning to attract families with young children before the school district announced a plan to close the school. The community was creating a plan to recruit additional families to the school. In May 2011 the school had 357 students. At that time the school district proposed closing the school and rezoning children to Memorial and Love Elementary Schools in order to cut costs. Sacaris, who stated her opposition to the closure, argued that the plan would not reduce costs because the district would have to spend more money to send school buses to send children to more distant schools. Sacaris also said that InTown Homes's plans to build 230 houses in the Stevenson attendance zone and the school's "Leader In Me Academy" are reasons to keep the school open. Jane West, the president of the superneighborhood that includes Cottage Grove, said that the school district would need the school's capacity within several years. West also stated that after the district closed nearby Ben Milam Elementary School, it was converted into a private preschool. The school district closed Stevenson in 2011. The post-closure preliminary Texas Education Agency 2011 rating was "Exemplary." The school district promoted the already-closed school as one of the 59 HISD schools that received exemplary ratings. The TEA ratings of Memorial and Love decreased from 2010 to 2011. Sacaris said that the news was "bittersweet."

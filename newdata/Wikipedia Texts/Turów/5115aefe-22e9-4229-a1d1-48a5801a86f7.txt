== History ==

The original athletic club was founded in 1948, as an athletic association with a football club in Bogatynia, called KS Miner Turoszów. In 1961, the club changed its name to Sports Club Turów. In June 1964, the athletic club added a sailing team. Then also in 1964, the athletic club formed the men's basketball section. Then in 1965, the club moved from Bogatynia to Zgorzelec.
The club was promoted to the Polish Premier League in 1978. After one season in the top division, Turów played in the lower Polish leagues for 25 years. The club won the Polish second division title in 2004, and was them promoted to up to the Polish first division once again.
In 2006, the basketball section took the name of KKS Turów Zgorzelec S.A, and the sailing club became a separate sports association called Sports Club Turów Zgorzelec. In 2007, the club reached a sponsorship agreement with PGE Group, and thus the club's name sponsor has been PGE Turów Zgorzelec since then.
Between 2007 and 2013, the club had 5 Polish League Finals appearances in the Tauron Basket Liga. However, the team lost in each of those finals appearances against Prokom Trefl Sopot / Asseco Prokom Gdynia.

In 2014, Turów won the Tauron Basket Liga championship, after they defeated Zielona Góra in the Finals 4–2. J.P. Prince led the team the whole season, and was rewarded with the PLK Most Valuable Player award. The 34-year-old veteran Filip Dylewicz was chosen as the 2014 PLK Finals MVP.
To add to the positive developments around the club, the team qualified for the 2014–15 Euroleague season. It would be the first appearance of the club on this level, and Turów is just the fourth Polish club to ever play in the Euroleague.
In July 2018, Turów withdrew from the PLK and was disestablished after PGE Group stopped financing the club.

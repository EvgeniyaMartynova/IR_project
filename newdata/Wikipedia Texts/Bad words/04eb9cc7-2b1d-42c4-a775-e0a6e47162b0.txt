Yoko! Jakamoko! Toto!

Yoko! Jakamoko! Toto! is an animated children's television series, produced by Collingwood O'Hare Productions Limited for HIT Entertainment and is currently distributed by Foothill Entertainment, which aired from 2 June 2003 to 29 August 2005 on CITV, and then aired on CBeebies from 26 January 2009. The show is about a bird-of-paradise, an armadillo, and a spider monkey who live and go on adventures in the wilderness and can only communicate by saying each other's names. An animated short film from the series made its American debut in 2 June 2003 as part of the New York International Children's Film Festival.
The show has aired on ABC in Australia (as well as its digital networks ABC Kids and ABC 2) from 24 February 2003 to 27 November 2006, TVO and Knowledge Network in Canada, Kids Central in Singapore, ATV in Hong Kong, e-Junior in the U.A.E., TBS in Japan, MiniMini in Poland, Discovery Kids in Spain, Canal 22 in Mexico, BFBS in Germany, Pakapaka in Argentina, ETTV in Taiwan, SVT in Sweden, NRK1 in Norway, France 3 in France and Cartoon Network (in the former Tickle-U block) in the US. Unlike most animated series, when the show was sold to several countries that don't speak English and have English as their first language it was never dubbed or translated into different languages or redubbed with a different range of voices as the characters in the show only had limited dialogue and can only communicate by saying anybody's names making all the voices retained and left alone.
While the series was in production, the distribution was done by Gullane Entertainment (formally known as The Britt Allcroft Company, the company that made Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends) up until July 2002, when the company was bought by HIT Entertainment.
Yoko! Jakamoko! Toto! has won numerous industry awards including Best Pilot at the Annecy International Festival of Animation, Best Writer at the British Animation Awards and two children's BAFTAs, including Best Writer and Best Pre-School Animation.

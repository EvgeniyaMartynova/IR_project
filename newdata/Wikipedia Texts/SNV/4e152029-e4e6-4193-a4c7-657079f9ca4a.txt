SNV Netherlands Development Organisation

SNV Netherlands Development Organisation is a non-profit international development organisation, established in the Netherlands in 1965.
Driven by the Sustainable Development Goals, SNV makes a lasting difference in the lives of people living in poverty by helping them raise incomes and access basic services. The organisation currently works in more than 25 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.


== History ==
SNV was established as the Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers ("Foundation of Netherlands Volunteers") in 1965, under the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Originally focused on posting young Dutch volunteers to the Global South, SNV stopped working with volunteers in 1988 in response to the changing needs of host organisations and countries. SNV has since evolved to become one of the largest Dutch development organisations.
In 1993 the organisation changed its name to SNV Netherlands Development Organisation and in 2002 formally separated from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

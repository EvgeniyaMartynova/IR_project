SNV (typeface)

SNV (also called VSS) is a sans-serif typeface used on road signs in several European countries. It was originally defined by the Association of Swiss Road Traffic Experts (German: Vereinigung Schweizerischer Strassenfachleute, VSS) and the Swiss Association for Standardization (Schweizerische Normen-Vereinigung, SNV). 
In Switzerland, it was replaced on road signs by ASTRA-Frutiger in 2003. It is still used on road signs in Belgium, Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Romania and the countries of the former Yugoslavia: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia.

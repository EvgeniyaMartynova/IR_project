Heng On station

Heng On (Chinese: 恆安; Cantonese Yale: Hàng'ōn) is a station on the Ma On Shan Line of Hong Kong MTR, named after the nearby Heng On Estate. It also serves other residential areas like Kam Fung Court, Kam On Court, Baycrest, Vista Paradiso, and Yiu On Estate. It also serves over 10 schools (including Renaissance College) and two sports centres – Ma On Shan Sports Ground and Heng On Sports Centre.
The print featured on the platform pillars and glass barrier is of farmland which used to exist in the Ma On Shan area.

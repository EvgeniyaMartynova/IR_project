Universal Business Language

Universal Business Language (UBL) is an open library of standard electronic XML business documents for procurement and transportation such as purchase orders, invoices, transport logistics and waybills. UBL was developed by an OASIS Technical Committee with participation from a variety of industry data standards organizations. UBL is designed to plug directly into existing business, legal, auditing, and records management practices. It is designed to eliminate the re-keying of data in existing fax- and paper-based business correspondence and provide an entry point into electronic commerce for small and medium-sized businesses.UBL is owned by OASIS and is currently available to all, with no royalty fees. The UBL library of business documents is a well-developed markup language with validators, authoring software, parsers and generators. UBL version 2.0 was approved as an OASIS Standard in October 2006. Version 2.1 was approved as an OASIS Standard in November 2013 and an ISO Standard (ISO/IEC 19845:2015) in December 2015. Version 2.2 was approved as an OASIS Standard in July 2018. Version 2.1 is fully backward compatible with version 2.0, but it adds 34 new document schemas, bringing the total of business document types defined by UBL to 65. Version 2.2 is fully backward compatible with version 2.1, and it adds another 16 document types for a total of 81.
UBL is described in an extensive overview in the article "What is UBL?" describing customizing and extending UBL, the governance of UBL, how UBL is modeled, and thoughts regarding deploying UBL.
UBL traces its origins back to the EDI standards and other derived XML standards.

== Subsets and customizations of UBL ==


=== Danish subsets: OIOXML and OIOUBL ===
In December 2003 Denmark legislated the mandatory use of a customization of UBL 0.7, using the OIOXML specification, for electronic invoicing for government procurement starting February 2005.  In March 2010 Denmark legislated the mandatory use of a customization of UBL 2.0, using the OIOUBL specification.
In 2011 the Danish government documented savings of €500,000,000 having used UBL.


=== Northern European Subset - NESUBL ===
As part of the Northern European cooperation on e-commerce and e-procurement, representatives from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, UK and Iceland set up a working group for developing a Northern European subset of UBL 2.0 documents. The main focus of NES is to define the semantic use of UBL 2.0 as applied to specific business processes. To achieve this the UBL 2.0 standard is restricted on additional levels by using "profiles" that apply to defined business situations. The use of individual elements is specifically described to avoid conflicting interpretation. Additionally each country has developed guidelines that describe the application of the NESUBL subset to domestic business practices. The goal is to enable companies and institutions to implement e-commerce by agreeing to a specific profile and thus eliminate the need for bilateral implementation. Additional countries have shown interest in joining the work. The NESUBL subset was published in March 2007.Since its publication, NESUBL subset has influenced government eProcurement initiatives across Europe, for example in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, The Netherlands, Turkey. It is also the basis for an eProcurement initiative, ePrior, by the European Commission, Directorate General's of the European Commission, starting with the Directorate General for Information Technology (DIGIT).  It is also the basis of the syntax for business documents created by the CEN/BII (Business Interoperability Initiative).


=== European-wide deployment of UBL in PEPPOL ===
PEPPOL, the Pan-European Public Procurement Online project now maintained by OpenPEPPOL, adopts the work products of CEN/TC434 and CEN/TC440 that include UBL customizations and syntax serializations of different document types for European business processes.  The goal of PEPPOL is to enable public procurement across borders within the EU.It was reported that CEN/TC434 has unanimously agreed to endorse UBL as one of two syntaxes complying with the forthcoming European Norm on e-Invoicing and will be listed in a specific CEN Technical Specification.
These efforts support Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement in Europe.
On March 3, 2017 this summary update of recent announcements was published, including references to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Italy (Emilia-Romagna region), Netherlands, Norway, Sweden.


=== Spanish UBL version based in CCI ===
In Spain, UBL is being used primarily for electronic invoice encoding. The UBL Spanish Localization Committee has been actively developing UBL awareness and has created implementation guidelines to allow easy adoption of UBL based on previous work done by CCI.


=== UBL Turkish Customization - UBL-TR ===
The UBL Turkish Localization Subcommittee customized the UBL 2.0 to be used in eInvoice process in Turkey. See also the IBM Knowledge Center.


=== Czech UBL Customization - ISDOC ===
The SPIS consortium (currently named ICT unie) created an UBL 2.0 customization ISDOC to be used for e-Invoicing in the Czech Republic. The recently released ISDOC 6 supports e-Requests too.


=== Peruvian UBL Customization - SUNAT ===
SUNAT, the national customs and tax administration for Peru, supports a customization of UBL 2.0.  Plans have been announced by SUNAT to migrate to UBL 2.1


=== Belgian UBL Customization - e-fff ===
In December 2011 the Belgian government specified a customization of UBL to maximize the interoperability of the  electronic invoice between Belgian actors.


=== Swedish UBL Customization - Svefaktura ===
SFTI, the joint project of the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SKL), Financial Management Authority (ESV) and the government contracting authority specified Svefaktura, a UBL customization.
As of November 1, 2018 it will be mandatory for Swedish electrical authorities to use PEPPOL.


=== Colombian UBL Customization - DIAN ===
DIAN, the Colombian national tax and customs directorate, implements  UBL 2 as the XML document format for electronic invoicing.


=== Norwegian UBL Customization - EHF ===
Difi, the Norwegian agency for Public Management and eGovernment, has chosen to use CEN BII as a base for the EHF formats and the Universal Business Language (UBL) as a foundation for the implemented syntax.


=== Dutch UBL Customization - UBL-OHNL and Simplerinvoicing ===
UBL-OHNL is a Dutch government-specific customization for submitting documents via Digipoort.
Simplerinvoicing is a community of e-invoicing, ERP and accounting software providers making e-invoicing in UBL available for everyone. It includes access to the PEPPOL network for secure and reliable transfer.
In response to the European Directive 2014/55/EU the Dutch government has mandated XML Invoicing for all contracts signed after January 1, 2017 using the UBL-OHNL customization via Digipoort or the Simplerinvoicing customization via PEPPOL.


=== Australia and New Zealand use of UBL ===
As part of a national initiative to increase the proportion of businesses participating in the Australian digital economy the Digital Business Council endorsed  an Interoperability Framework in 2016. The initial version of the framework includes a set of policies, standards and guidelines to promote the economy-wide adoption of eInvoicing. A subset of UBL 2.1 for the invoice and business response  document was included in this initial release. The subset was initially based on a working draft of the European Committee for Standardization's work under the CEN/TC 434 - Electronic Invoicing project
In 2017 OASIS established a localisation subcommittee to promote the harmonised use of UBL and to support the broader market adoption across Australia. The subcommittee facilitates an open dialogue for information sharing and collaboration, under the auspices of OASIS transparent governance and operating procedures.
Further guidance and support is facilitated by third parties such as

DCAF Online - a contemporary and transparent approach to businesses having visibility of the digital standards and frameworks their service providers support. Recognised service providers are listed and resources are available to support the economy-wide adoption of digital procurement.In February 2019 "the two countries’ intention to jointly adopt the Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL) interoperability framework for trans-Tasman e-invoicing" was announced by the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Australia.


=== Italian use of UBL ===
The future of e-invoicing in Italy will facilitate the correct implementation of the national Technical Rules for Interoperability between e-Procurement platforms (Circolare 3 AgID) and the automation of the end-to-end procurement process, based on PEPPOL or, where a PEPPOL specification is not available, by implementing a CEN BII profile using the OASIS UBL 2.1 syntax. In the long term, likely by 2022, the objective is to migrate to a single global standard, UBL, still supporting the other mandatory syntax with translations, and phasing out the national format.


=== Singaporean use of UBL ===
Singapore has established the first PEPPOL Authority outside of Europe with the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) to help businesses in Singapore to benefit from digitalisation and better position themselves to plug into the international marketplace.


=== United States and Canadian use of UBL ===
On October 4, 2018 the Business Payments Coalition e-Invoicing Subcommittee, an open technical committee consisting of US, Canadian, and Mexican interests in electronic invoicing and facilitated by the US Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, released its first review of the semantic model of an invoice, expressed using the business objects of OASIS UBL 2.2.

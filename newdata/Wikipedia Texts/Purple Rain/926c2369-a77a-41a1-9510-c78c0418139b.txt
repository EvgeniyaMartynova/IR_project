Purple Rain Tour

The Purple Rain Tour was a concert tour by American recording artist Prince and The Revolution following up on the success of his sixth studio album Purple Rain and his 1984 film Purple Rain. According to Spin, the tour sold over 1.7 million tickets.


== History ==
The tour marked the live debut of the band now named The Revolution as Wendy Melvoin made her appearance as the new guitarist in Prince's band, taking over for the departed Dez Dickerson, completing the iconic line-up of the band.
In addition to Prince and The Revolution, they were joined on tour by Apollonia 6, and Sheila E. and her band. Despite gaining fame from their appearance in the film and releasing a third album, The Time were not invited to tour, as by 1985 the group had been depleted, with many of its remaining key members quitting to embark on personal careers.

The Purple Rain Tour was the first Prince tour to open with brand new material. In this case, it was with the album opener, "Let's Go Crazy". A triple dose from the 1999 album followed: "Delirious",  "1999" and "Little Red Corvette".  An instrumental interlude of "Yankee Doodle" usually introduced another 1999 song, "Free".  The B-side "God" was often played, followed by a usual sequence of "Computer Blue", "Darling Nikki", "The Beautiful Ones" and "When Doves Cry" (featuring a mirror setup onstage to mimic the video of the song).  As encores, the remaining Purple Rain songs closed the concert, "I Would Die 4 U", "Baby I'm a Star" and "Purple Rain".  The three songs were extended, often taking 30 minutes to perform.  "Take Me with U" was often worked in, completing all the album tracks.  Other songs sometimes included were "Father's Song", "How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?", the new "Temptation", "Let's Pretend We're Married" and "Do Me, Baby".  On rare occasions, "International Lover", "Dirty Mind", "I Wanna Be Your Lover" would pop up.  Later in the tour, an instrumental of "Under the Cherry Moon" was sometimes played. The B-side "Irresistible Bitch" was segued into the unreleased "Possessed" on the Syracuse venue.

"Purple Rain"Notes

During performance of "I Would Die 4 U"/"Baby I'm a Star", Prince would invite Apollonia 6, and Sheila E. to jam with him for a 20-30 minute rendition of the songs.
At the Landover, Maryland concert, the performance of "I Would Die 4 U"/"Baby I'm a Star" were recorded and used as a promo video for the song played on MTV.
The Syracuse, New York concert on March 30, 1985 was recorded and released on VHS later in 1985.
Singers Bruce Springsteen and Madonna joined Prince on stage during "Baby I'm a Star" at the February 23, 1985 concert at The Forum in Inglewood, California.
A little known fact is that Prince performed his Purple Rain Concert a month before its first scheduled date in Detroit in a concert hall called "Bogarts" on Sept. 23, 1984 in Cincinnati, Ohio.  It was hinted on the local Urban Contemporary station, WBLZ, but only a few individuals knew that he would actually show up.  He played a full set for a crowd of 2500 as a trial run, and even Morris Day and Sheila E were present.

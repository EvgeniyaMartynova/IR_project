University College Boat Club (Oxford)

Oxford University Boat Club (OUBC) is the rowing club of the University of Oxford, England, located on the River Thames at Oxford. The club was founded in the early 19th century.
OUBC's boat house on the Isis (as the Thames is known at Oxford) burnt down in 1999 and much archival material, including photographs, was lost. OUBC now rows from its new purpose-built boat house in Wallingford, south of Oxford, following a successful fundraising appeal from 2004 to 2007. The boathouse was designed following a limited competition by Tuke Manton Architects LLP. The club has the use of the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake in south Oxfordshire for training purposes, along with the GB Rowing squad and University College Oxford Boat Club.


== The Boat Race ==
The club races against the Cambridge University Boat Club in The Boat Race on the Thames in London each year, with the Oxford boat based at the Westminster School Boat Club. Oxford's team are commonly referred to as the "Dark Blues".
It has featured medal-winning Olympic rowers (e.g., Matthew Pinsent & Constantine Louloudis) and coxes (e.g. Colin Moynihan, who played a leading role in organizing the 2012 Olympic Games in London).


== History ==
OUBC was one of five clubs which retained the right until 2012 to appoint representatives to the Council of British Rowing.  The others were Leander Club, London Rowing Club, Thames Rowing Club and Cambridge University Boat Club.

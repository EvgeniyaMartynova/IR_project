== Club career ==
Turner began his career at Derby County but moved to Ireland to join Sligo Rovers in December 2005 after the club returned to the top flight by winning the First Division title a month earlier. Turner helped Sligo to fifth position in their first season back in the big time and remained at the Showgrounds for the opening half of the 2007 season before signing for Bohemians in the July transfer window.
At Dalymount Park, Turner made his club debut in an FAI Cup win over Malahide United on 19 August 2007. However, after Sean Connor departed at the end of that season, Turner found himself out of favour under Pat Fenlon and he left the Gypsies by mutual consent in July 2008. He eventually signed for Partick Thistle. He had had a trial at Rangers F.C. before signing for Partick.He was released by the Firhill outfit midway through the 2008–09 campaign, however, and he returned to Ireland and signed for Dundalk.

== Background ==
The first episode of Crash Course aired on April 16, 2012, on BBC America, following the premiere of season 18 of Top Gear. The show's first episode features Hammond learning how to operate an American Army M1A2 Abrams tank at Fort Bliss. A total of six episodes were filmed. A trailer for the show's second season was released on September 25, 2012. The second season premiered on October 22, 2012. Writing for MotorAuthority.com, Nelson Ireson described the series as being like "Dirty Jobs but centered around vehicles". Ireson also commented that the BBC appears to be capitalizing on Hammond's "notoriety" as a Top Gear presenter due to the show being the top "unscripted" show on BBC America.

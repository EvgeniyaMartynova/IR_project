Famous Macedonia

Famous Macedonia (Greek: Μακεδονία ξακουστή, romanized: Macedonía xacustí, pronounced [mɐce̞ðo̞ˈɲi.ɐ ks̠ɐkuˈs̠ti]) is a song and military march, often regarded as the official anthem of Macedonia, Greece, and used by the Hellenic Army since the Balkan Wars.
It is associated with the Macedonomáchœ in the Macedonicós Agónas and can be heard on parades and in national anniversaries.
Until the recent introduction of 24-hour programming, it also marked the end of radio programs on the local Macedonian channel ("Rádjo Macedonía 102 FM"), played before Hýmnos is tin Eleftherían.
It is written in Dorian scale, in iambic 15-syllable. The beat is 2/4 and it can be danced as a chasápico. It can be performed in conjunction with the Makedonia dance. In addition, the text refers to Alexander the Great, who is the progenitor of the Greek Macedonians.


== Origin ==
The origin of the march is not certain. According to an ethnographic study conducted in villages in Serres and Drama, the song wasn't known or danced to in the area. Women from Ano Oreini and Petrousa attribute the Greek lyrics and the teaching of the dance to an anonymus teacher after World War II. Women from Petrousa claim that the melody of the song is a modification of a local malody of theirs, which was made "somewhere more centrally", and they dance to a similar melody with Slavic lyrics and different steps, similar to those of other local traditional dances.The musicologist Markos Dragoumis found a cassette with Ladino songs of Thessaloniki, which included the melody of the song, as a composition made for the opening of the Schola de la Alianza, the first Jewish school of Thessaloniki, in 1873. Dragoumis guesses that it was either composed for the opening of the school and later was transmitted to the groups in the area, or it was originally composed in the middle of the 19th century by some Western composer for the Ottoman Sultan and later used by the Jewish communities.According to the Greek Army's website, it is a military march—or emvatírjo (εμβατήριο)—based on the traditional Macedonicós Chorós (Μακεδονικός Χορός), which is related with Acrítes of Byzantium.

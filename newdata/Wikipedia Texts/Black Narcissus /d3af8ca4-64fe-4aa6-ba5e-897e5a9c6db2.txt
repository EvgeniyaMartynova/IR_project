== Reception ==
In a review for AllMusic, Jesse Jarnow states "listening to Black Narcissus can be a confusing and trying experience. Each sound suggests something new, and all three musicians are wont to follow that impulse as quickly as possible. It is liberating and beautiful, but also so hyper that it is impossible to listen to with anything but rapt attention. Unless one commits fully to the disc, it will probably sound like an experimental annoyance. If one is willing to surrender, though, there is a rich world waiting".

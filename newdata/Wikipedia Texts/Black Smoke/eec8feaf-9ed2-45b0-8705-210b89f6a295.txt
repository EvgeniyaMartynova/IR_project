== Themes and composition ==
Opening track "Highway Tune" is the first song the band had ever written, dating back to their original drummer. "Safari Song" is almost as old. Sam revealed that it originally had a "big percussion break with like bongos and congas, very kind of Santana, kind of South American style" that got cut from the version included on the EP."Flower Power" was written around 2014, when Jake created the guitar riff. Sam explained "Jake just started playing two chords together and, you know, magic happened. I sat down on the organ and started playing the part and then Josh came out and sang the song all the way through, like it was already written." He also said he was imagining the end of "America" by Simon and Garfunkel for its organ outro. Josh said to him it gave a San Francisco Haight-Ashbury vibe and was written with a "folk influence and a nod to that era's sound."The title track was written in the studio during the recording of the other three. Its lyrics are a "reflection on the lessons of history and that man does not always learn from the lessons of history" and "in a more positive light, embodies a unity of humanity."


== Reception ==
As of February 24, 2018, the EP has sold 70,000 units (including 47,000 in traditional album sales) in the U.S.

Field Artillery (magazine)

Field Artillery (or FA) is a discontinued bimonthly magazine on the subject of field artillery, published from 1911 to 2007. It was published by the US Field Artillery Association, Fort Sill, Oklahoma and was an official publication of the United States Army Field Artillery Corps. Its intended readership included active and reserve U.S. Army and Marine field artillerymen stationed around the world. In its final years, FA included much discussion of the military operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq.


== History ==
The magazine was first published as the Field Artillery Journal in 1911. It has gone through several name changes. Due to low subscriptions it merged with the Infantry Journal in 1950, and was published as Combat Forces Journal; CFJ became Army in 1954.
The US Army Artillery and Missile School began the in-house publication of Tactical and Technical Trends in Artillery for Instruction in 1957 that was renamed to Artillery Trends in 1958. After the Artillery branch split into the Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery branches in 1969, the name changed to The Field Artilleryman. Field Artillery Journal restarted in 1973 as an official Field Artillery branch publication. Due to budget cuts, the magazine dropped a number of sections and was renamed Field Artillery in 1987.As part of the cost-saving measures of Base Realignment and Closure, several branch professional magazines were directed to merge. Field Artillery ceased publication with its final edition of Marchâ€“April 2007. The successor is Fires, a merger of Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery magazines.

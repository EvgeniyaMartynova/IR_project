Gulf of Gonâve

The Gulf of Gonâve (French: Golfe de la Gonâve; Haitian Creole: Lagonav) is a large gulf of the Caribbean Sea along the western coast of Haiti. Haiti's capital city, Port-au-Prince, is located on the coast of the gulf. Other cities on the gulf coast include Gonaïves, Saint-Marc, Miragoâne, and Jérémie. Several islands are located in the gulf, the largest being Gonâve Island, followed by the much smaller Cayemites.

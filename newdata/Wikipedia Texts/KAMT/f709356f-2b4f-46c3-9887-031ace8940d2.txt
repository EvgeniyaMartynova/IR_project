KAMT-LP was a low-powered TeleFutura affiliate in Amarillo, Texas. Founded in 2005 and owned by Drewry Communications, it broadcast on UHF channel 50.
On June 25, 2008, original owner Equity Media Holdings disclosed that it was selling KAMT to Luken Communications, LLC.Equity Media Holdings has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy since December 2008 and offers by Luken Communications to acquire Equity-owned stations in six markets have since been withdrawn. On April 10, 2009, Equity Media announced a fire sale of all television stations - KAMT was set for an asking price of $750,000.  However, a buyer was not found until October, when Drewry Communications Group, then-owner of KFDA-TV (now owned by Gray Television), announced that it would purchase the station as part of a larger deal.The station's license was surrendered to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on October 6, 2010, and the KAMT-LP call sign was cancelled by the FCC that same day.

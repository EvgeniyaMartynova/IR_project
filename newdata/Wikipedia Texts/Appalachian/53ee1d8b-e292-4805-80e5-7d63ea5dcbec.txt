Appalachian Americans

Appalachian Americans describes Americans living in Appalachia, or their descendants.  While not an official demographic used or recognized by the United States Census Bureau, Appalachian Americans, due to various factors, have developed their own distinct culture within larger social groupings.  Included are their own dialect, music, folklore, and even sports teams as in the case of the Appalachian League.  Furthermore, many colleges and universities now grant degrees in Appalachian studies.  The term has seen growing usage in recent years, possibly in opposition to the use of hillbilly, which is still often used to describe people of the region.

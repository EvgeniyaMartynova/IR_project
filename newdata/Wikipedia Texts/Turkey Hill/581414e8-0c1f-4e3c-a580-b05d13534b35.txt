As the family increased in size, Linthicum added another story to the frame portion, making it two and a half stories high. Also on the property is a birdhouse, modeled after Camden Station in Baltimore City; a late-19th-century carriage house; a late-19th-century meathouse; and an early-20th-century garage also stand on the property.Turkey Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

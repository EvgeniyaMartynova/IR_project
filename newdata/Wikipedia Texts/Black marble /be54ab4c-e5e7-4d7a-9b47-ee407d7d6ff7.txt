The Black Marble

Black Marble is an American music project formed in 2012 in Brooklyn, New York. It is led by electronic musician Chris Stewart and formerly featured Ty Kube of Team Robespierre.


== History ==
Black Marble began in 2012 with the release of an EP on Hardly Art titled Weight Against the Door. Also in 2012, Black Marble released its first full-length album on Hardly Art titled A Different Arrangement. These works were described as "throwbacks to the cold-wave genre" by Leo Neufeld of the Miami New Times.In 2016, Black Marble released its second full-length album, titled It's Immaterial. It was released on Ghostly International. The album marked Ty Kube's departure from the project and Chris Stewart's move from the East to West Coast. Kristin Porter of SLUG said Stewart "keeps the band's Brooklyn, New York–synth roots alive, resulting in a collection of songs with amplified vocals, pastel-colored synths and a hint of modern-day deference, which is evocatively scored by Stewart's personal, nostalgic touch coupled with every happy-sad, Ian Curtis–garage dance party you've never been to."On July 25, 2019, the band announced that its third studio album, Bigger Than Life, will be released on October 25 through Sacred Bones Records. The record's first single, "One Eye Open", was released along with the announcement.In October 2019, Black Marble revealed the music video to their latest album song Private Show.

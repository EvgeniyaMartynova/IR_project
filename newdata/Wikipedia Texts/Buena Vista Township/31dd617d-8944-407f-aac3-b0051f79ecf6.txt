Buena Vista Township, New Jersey

Buena Vista Township (pronounced "BYOO-nuh VISS-tuh") is a township located in Atlantic County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the township had a total population of 7,570, reflecting an increase of 134 (+1.8%) from the 7,436 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 219 (-2.9%) from the 7,655 counted in the 1990 Census.Buena Vista was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 5, 1867, from portions of Hamilton Township. Portions of the township were taken on May 23, 1906, to create Folsom, and on September 1, 1948, to create Buena Borough. The name comes from the 1847 Battle of Buena Vista of the Mexican–American War.The township is headquarters for Troop A of the New Jersey State Police, which covers more than 2,000 square miles (5,200 km2) and 1.7 million residents.

On April 26, 2004, the Buena Vista Township Committee voted to temporarily rename the community of Richland, a section of Buena Vista Township. For the first half of the month of May, Richland became Mojito, New Jersey, named after the Cuban rum drink. Bacardi had offered to give the township $5,000 for recreation projects in exchange for a sign placed on U.S. Route 40 commemorating the new name. Richland was chosen because it is home to the family-run Dalponte Farms, a major east coast supplier of mint, an essential ingredient of the mojito.

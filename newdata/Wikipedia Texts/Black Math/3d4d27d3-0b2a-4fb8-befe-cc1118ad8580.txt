The would be fourteenth episode of the season, titled "Please, Baby, Please", was shot in November 2017, and originally scheduled to air on February 27, 2018. However on February 22, 2018, ABC announced that the episode would be pulled from the schedule and that a repeat of a past episode would air instead. USA Today stated that the episode "was apparently too political for the network". An ABC spokesperson said that there "were creative differences we were unable to resolve". On March 10, 2018, it was officially announced that the network had no plans to air the episode. In the episode, Dre tries to read a bedtime story to Devante during a thunderstorm, but instead improvises a new story based on recent social and political issues in the United States.

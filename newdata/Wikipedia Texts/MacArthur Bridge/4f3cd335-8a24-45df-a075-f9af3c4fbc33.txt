Keelung River

The Keelung River (Chinese: 基隆河; pinyin: Jīlóng Hé; Wade–Giles: Chi1-lung2 Ho2; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Ke-lâng-hô) is a river in northern Taiwan.
The Keelung River originates in the mountains west-northwest of the town of Jingtong in Pingxi District, New Taipei City, flows down to a rift valley and then flows ENE to Sandiaoling. Then it flows northward to a point between Chiufen and Keelung City, and then heads back in a general WSW direction to Taipei, where it joins the Tamsui River and flows out to sea. The land around the Keelung river was rich in gold and coal, and many areas were mined.

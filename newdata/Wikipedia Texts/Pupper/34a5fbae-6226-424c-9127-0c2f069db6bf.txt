DoggoLingo

DoggoLingo, also referred to as woof, bork and dog-speak, is an internet language that is created from word conversion, meme lexicon, and onomatopoeia. DoggoLingo is implied to be a dog's own idiom, and is presented as what humans have long believed goes on in the canine brain. Elyse Graham, assistant professor at Stony Brook University, describes DoggoLingo as "upbeat, joyful, and clueless in a relentlessly friendly way".


== Structure ==
DoggoLingo appends various suffixes "-o", "-er", "-ino" to existing English words (i.e. dog turns into doggo, pup turns into pupper) and DoggoLingo words that have been created (i.e. pupper turns into pupperino, bork turns into borker). DoggoLingo relies heavily upon onomatopoeia. Words such as blep, blop and mlem, that describe the action of a dog sticking out its tongue. Also, bork, boof, woof to describe the various canine barking sounds. DoggoLingo is simplistic and also creates words based upon the appearance of a canine. For example, a dog with a fluffy coat would be called a floof or a fluff depending upon the fur's visual texture. The DoggoLingo follows the same rudimentary style to create its verbs (i.e. doin me a in place of the verb to do) and adjectives (e.g. heckin in place of the degree modifier extremely).


== Origin ==
The exact origin of DoggoLingo is unknown. Various social media accounts such as WeRateDogs (Twitter), Dogspotting (Facebook), as well as social news aggregation and imageboard websites like 4chan, Reddit, or Tumblr have aided in popularizing the use of DoggoLingo by consistently using or hosting content that uses the lingo on their Internet pages. In 2014, the Dogspotting Facebook account gained popularity, especially in Australia where coincidentally adding "-o" to the end of words is also a feature of Australian slang.


== Other animals ==
Internet fan groups for other animals have adopted many of the conventions of DoggoLingo for their own related languages for their preferred animals (like Posso or Poss-speak for opossums). Lolcats may be a precursor to DoggoLingo.

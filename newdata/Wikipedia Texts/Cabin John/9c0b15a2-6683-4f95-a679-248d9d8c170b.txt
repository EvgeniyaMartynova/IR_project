== Route description ==

Cabin John Parkway begins at a partial interchange with Clara Barton Parkway in the unincorporated area of Cabin John. The interchange allows access from southbound Cabin John Parkway to eastbound Clara Barton Parkway and from westbound Clara Barton Parkway to northbound Cabin John Parkway. Each direction of the parkway crosses Cabin John Creek before the roadways come together to pass under the Union Arch Bridge, which carries the Washington Aqueduct and MacArthur Boulevard. Cabin John Parkway crosses Cabin John Creek again before continuing north as a four-lane freeway with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour (89 km/h) through a forested corridor paralleling the creek. After crossing Booze Creek, the two directions of the parkway divide toward their termini at I-495 (Capital Beltway) in Bethesda. The northbound direction of the Cabin John Parkway splits into single-lane ramps for northbound I-495 and I-495's interchange with MD 190 (River Road). The southbound parkway is formed by ramps from southbound I-495 and MD 190.Cabin John Parkway is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration and has an internal designation of I-495X. Trucks are prohibited on the parkway. Cabin John Parkway is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length.

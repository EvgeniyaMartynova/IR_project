Parker's Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador

Parker's Cove or Parkers Cove is a town in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The town had a population of 248 in the Canada 2016 Census, a drop from 301 in 2011. Parkers Cove consists of few attractions, some of which include a collection of "stages" (fishing shacks that are suspended above water) called "the walk" by locals, and the local convenience store dubbed "the shop".
Neither of these sites include any historical significance, the only site to hold historical significance is "the old road" which, as you can imagine, is the trail that was used to travel to and from Parkers Cove but is now used for recreational off-roading. To explain some geography and local lingo, upon entry of Parkers Cove via road sign, you are currently on "the branch". Once you reach the first house you are now going down "the hill", When you reach the bottom of the hill you will reach a stop sign at which you can either go left to go across "the gut" or take a right to go "out around the harbour". Going across the gut takes you to the walk and going out around the harbour takes you to not only the shop but also a place known as "red cove". Red cove is just a dead-end road that provides a great view of the Atlantic Ocean and it is not known why it's called "red cove".

Gândul

Gândul (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈɡɨndul], "The Thought") is a Romanian daily newspaper published in Bucharest. It was founded in May 2005 by Mircea Dinescu, who used to write a daily editorial called "Vorba lu' Dinescu", and Cristian Tudor Popescu, who was also the editor-in-chief until January 2008. Its initial circulation was about 52,000. In 2006, Publimedia acquired Gândul and subsequently changed the format, nameplate and design.

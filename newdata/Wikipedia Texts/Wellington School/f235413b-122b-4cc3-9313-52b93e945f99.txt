Gard, Bob Holland, Len Immke, George Minot, Dave Swaddling, Dave Thomas, Jack Ruscilli, and Jeff Wilkins. They spent three years refining plans, raising money, finding a property, and recruiting teachers and students. In 1982, The Wellington School opened with 137 students and 19 employees as the first co-ed independent school in Columbus. The first graduating class was in 1989 with 32 students.

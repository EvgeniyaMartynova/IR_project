The event was initially held at Camp Ozark Avalon, located in Boonville, Missouri but the 2011 and 2012 events were moved to the Shriner's campground in Laquey to accommodate growing attendance. 2016 ticket sales were set at 2000 and sold out.

The safety rangers of the event ("InterRangers") proudly offer Black Rock Ranger training and practical experience to those wishing to become BRC Rangers on the Playa. Instead of a Division of Public Works, or DPW, Interfuse's public works crew is known as TLA (The Leisure Army). Their motto, "All leisure, no army" is an inside joke that tells very little about all of the hard work they do in setting up the event infrastructure and keeping the essential services available and running.

Columbus Day Weekend - Myschievia began in 2005, when approximately 200 participants attended a location about 2 hours west of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Since 2006, Myschievia has been held in East Texas near Hughes Springs, Texas. Much like the Burning Man or any regional Burn, a theme may be chosen around which participants can creatively interact, though Myschievians chose not to have a theme in 2006 and 2007. Activities range from water balloon flights, to morning yoga classes, to themed dinners, to the annual Miss Myschievia pageant. The theme for the first year was "Trial By Fire," an old west courtroom-styled theme. The effigy was a 25-foot (7.6 m) tall model of the Scales of Justice. In 2006 the effigy was of the Roman Coliseum and featured several nights of spontaneous wrestling, both staged and real. In 2007 a giant head was constructed with a movable mouth. Its wild "hair," made of individual lengths of 2x6 lumber, was decorated and donated by the participants, who called the effigy "Unruly Man." For 2008, the theme was "Burning Bridges," and the effigy for 2008 was a bridge. In 2009, Pyrosynthesis was the theme, with the effigy being a flowerpot that participants could fill with their own "flowers," individual works of art intended to burn.

===== Vermont =====

It has moved around over the years, its first year being held in New Hampshire and has since settled in Vermont. It is still looking for a larger site than the ~60 acres used in 2009–2016. 600 tickets were sold for 2011 (capped) and 1050 tickets in 2016 (capped), largely restricted by limited nearby parking.


===== Virginia =====
Ignite (official site)
Ignite is the first Virginia regional burn sanctioned by (Burningman) and guided by the 10 Guiding Principles.  Originally blossoming out of Transformus's Town Hall and work-play weekend, Ignite! became an officially sanctioned Burning Man burn in 2015. Much like (Transformus) houses the city of Mysteria, Ignite! raises the city of Combustia. This is the place where your Burner spark can be fanned into flame for the year as you make new friends, learn together, and dance the night away. At Ignite! there is a focus on "Learn 'n Burn," where you, the community, can bring your knowledge and skills to share with others via our platforms for playful learning, which are called "playforms". Originally started in 2013, the playform concept has been met with resounding success and positive community feedback. Helping our community learn and grow is part of what makes Ignite! special. Never fear though, Ignite! has all the nighttime fun you expect from a good Burn: theme camps, music, dancing, fire performances, an Effigy burn, and plenty of interesting sights to see. Ignite! is an all-ages burn where family presence is encouraged! There is a neighborhood for families named "Kindleton" where those with little Burners can camp together. There are playforms just for kids, such as the "wiggle worm pentathlon," and several art projects, including building small effigies for the Temple Burn.


===== Washington =====
Critical Northwest (official site)
Critical Northwest (or CNW), formerly Critical Massive, is an annual alternative arts and performance festival staged in the greater Puget Sound region of Washington. Critical Northwest was started in 2002 by Burning Man participants from the Seattle area. The Massive organization became the Massive LLC in 2004 with a board of six members. In 2006, Ignition Northwest assumed producer responsibilities for the event, their board appoints a producer(s) each year.The original board produced the event at a local clothing-optional resort, Lake Bronson, in Monroe, Washington before moving the event to Lake Recreation Associates Campground (or LARC) in Mount Vernon, Washington in 2006, and the privately held campground of River outside of Maple Valley, Washington in 2007, returning to LARC 2008-2015 with the exception of 2013, when the event was held at the Shelton Fair Grounds. Ignition Northwest signed a 10-year contract with Masonic Family Park in Granite Falls early January 2016, establishing a permanent home for the event.The event is attended primarily by participants of the Seattle, Oregon, and British Columbia Burning Man community, with some participants coming from as far away as the United Kingdom. Much like Burning Man, Critical Northwest relies heavily on large theme camps, art, and individual participants to build the temporary village. Art grants are distributed through the local Burner-based nonprofit organization, Ignition Northwest. In 2007, approximately $7,500 was distributed to multiple art projects, over $12,000 was awarded in 2015.Many of the core values of Critical Northwest are borrowed from Burning Man, and the same short, memorable terms are used for them. Due to the fact that the event is held in the highest population density center of the Pacific Northwest region, including Idaho, Oregon, and portions of British Columbia, the event's environment is significantly different than the Black Rock Desert. The event has been held on the west side of the Cascade mountain range in the Pacific Northwest rain forest. Consequently, the size of the event with the number of participants has been limited significantly simply for the fact that there are few venues capable of holding several individuals for a week-long event in the Northwest. Attendance has been variable over the years, with almost 1100 people in 2013, and an average of 700 participants when hosted at LARC. Capacity at the new permanent venue is set at 800 for 2016, with ability to grow well beyond 1,000.Additionally, unlike Burning Man where the central effigy of a glowing neon man stays essentially unaltered from year to year (with alteration to its base and other design elements), the Critical Massive event may not have a central effigy, or indeed a last-night event. Usually, fire performances and other exhibitions occur on the last night of the event, but are limited in scope and size due to fire restrictions, especially in the forest-fire prone mountains.


===== West Virginia =====
Frostburn (official site)
Frostburn is a winter celebration of art and community on Marvin's Mountaintop in Masontown, West Virginia a short distance from Morgantown. The regional burn promotes the Ten Principles of Burning Man in a harsh environment, highlighting the need for community members to collaborate against severe weather to create and install interactive art and theme camps. A gift economy is encouraged, while commercial activity is generally prohibited. Frostburn participants are expected to actively contribute to the spirit of the event in radically expressive (but socially responsible) ways, leaving no trace of their presence after the event has ended.  Frostburn took place for its first five years at Cooper's Lake Campground, which also serves as the site of the annual Pennsic War (the largest annual event of the Society for Creative Anachronism). For the next two years, Frostburn was held Camp Kevin, further north near Brookville, PA, before moving south to Marvin's Mountaintop outside of Masontown, WV for 2015.  Frostburn happens yearly during Presidents Day weekend in February.
Constellation (official site)
Constellation is an experiment in community-based on the Ten Principles of Burning Man, intended for community members of the region to come together to connect, explore, build, burn, heal, dance and challenge themselves beyond the boundaries of what they all think possible.

Where the Sheep Sleep (official site)The Netherlands have their own lush green playa at the Veluwe area. This Dutch iteration of Burning Man principles is laced with Art, theme camps, performances and music, all brought and shared by participants from all over the world. The purpose of this long weekend is to dream together and create a reality that you won't forget. After the intimate first start July 29–31, 2016 at Kootwijk (near the Dutch Desert), with 750 participants; the 2017 edition is a day longer July 27–31, 2017 at Apeldoorn and grew organically. Don't expect alkaline-dried-out skin on this playa, but Dutch weather (rain and shine on the same day), plenty of wondrous participants, green acres and even a mutant vehicle or two.
The 2018 edition of WtSS which was held July 26–30 encountered unusually dry and hot weather conditions with temperatures over 38C/100F. Due to a long period of no rain before the event, all fire was forbidden by the authorities which led to the inception of a water-based 'Burn' at the end of the event.

Burn2 (official site)
Burn2 is the only officially recognized Burning Man regional in the virtual world (cyber space). Burn2 occupies a region (simulator or "sim") in Second Life® year-round, with extra regions added to their virtual space during its annual event nicknamed "Octoburn". Burn2 is run by a group of volunteers that include people directly involved with Burning Man, digital artists with a genuine interest in Burning Man, along with seasoned Second Life® programmers. The Burn2 regional is open year-round to WELCOME HOME BURNERS. This digital playa is unique in that it provides a home to Burners who may not be able to travel to their local regional. Participation is from Burners from all over the world! Burn2 offers classes for those interested in building in a digital world, offers mentors for newbies, and throws some fantastic parties! 
The core Ten Principles of Burning Man are celebrated, demonstrated and encouraged. Burn2 has many of the elements of the Burning Man Event, including being set in a desert playa virtual environment. At Burn2, you will experience many of the same organized groups as Burning Man; such as Greeters- who are the first people you meet at the entrance to events; Lamplighters- guardians of the Ten Principles and bringers of the flame to the virtual playa and the Temple; Fire Dancers- the Lamplighters who give special performances at selected events, Rangers- specially trained mediators always ready to help Burners to do their best to practice the Ten Principles of Burning Man, a Department of Mutant Vehicles- those crazy art cars you see rolling around in the dust, and Fashionistas- who loudly celebrate their Radical Self Expression in wild costumes as they strut their stuff in fashion shows on the playa!
Many talented artists generously build and gift their art to this community which is open year-round with events every quarter.Welcome to Burn2

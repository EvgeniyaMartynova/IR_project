Holy Martyrs of Lisbon

The Holy Martyrs of Lisbon (Portuguese: Santos MÃ¡rtires de Lisboa) were three Christian siblings, Verissimus, Maxima, and Julia, executed in Olisipo in the Roman province of Lusitania (modern-day Lisbon, Portugal), during the Diocletian Persecution.
The martyrdom of Verissimus, Maxima, and Julia is the subject of a series of paintings by Garcia Fernandes, painted c. 1530.

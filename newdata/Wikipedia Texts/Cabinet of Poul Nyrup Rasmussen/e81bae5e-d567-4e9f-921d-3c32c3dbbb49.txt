Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen III

After the 1998 Danish parliamentary election, the sitting Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was able to reform the government coalition of his own Social Democrats and the Danish Social Liberal Party. The resulting cabinet, which replaced the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen III, was formed on 23 March 1998 and was called the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen IV.
The cabinet was replaced by the Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I on 27 November 2001, after the Liberal Party's Anders Fogh Rasmussen had gained parliamentary support in the 2001 Danish parliamentary election.

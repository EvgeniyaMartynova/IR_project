Helladius (4th century hieromartyr)

Helladius or Helladios is a saint and hieromartyr (i.e. a martyred priest) in the Eastern Orthodox Church.
Almost nothing is known of his life or legend. It is said that he was a bishop who refused to deny his Christian faith; and that in consequence he was tortured, was thrown into the fire but miraculously survived, and was savagely beaten to death. It is said that Christ visited him in prison, and healed his wounds. It is also said that he died during the Persian invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.His feast day is variously given as 27 May  and 28 May.

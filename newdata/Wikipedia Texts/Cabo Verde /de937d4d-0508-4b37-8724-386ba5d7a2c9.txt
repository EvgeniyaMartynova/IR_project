The airline employed 14 pilots including 2 freelancers.The little airline grew fast under the command of Captain JC Bartz and actively contributed to the tourism development on the island of Boa Vista. Captain JC Bartz sold the airline back in 2007 to the Portuguese group Omni Aviacao, the owner of White Airways. Its head office is at the Amílcar Cabral International Airport in Espargos, Sal.

Udayar (caste)

The Udayar also called Parkavakulam is a caste found in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. They are composed of various sub groups such  as Srutiman, Nathaman, Malayaman, Moopanar and Nainar.


== Etymology ==
The word Udayar in Tamil means Lord or Possessor as in Possessor of land or kingdom.


== Origin ==
Malayaman was the hereditary title of the Velir chiefs of Miladu who served as feudatories of the Medieval Cholas. They ruled with Tirukoilur as their capital. The most famous among them was Malayaman Thirumudi Kaari. It is of interest to note that the mother of Rajaraja Chola I was a princess of Malayaman family. Similarly the title Srutiman was borne by many officials of the Chola dynasty, for example, the chief of the elephant corps of Rajaraja Chola I was one Srutiman Nakkan Chandiran. Their primary occupation seems to have been agriculture as they are recorded as cultivators of the left-hand class in an inscription (dated 1218 CE) of Kulothunga Chola III.


== Present Status ==
According to Selva Raj, the Udayar are "socially humbler" than the Vellalar community but, together with the Pallar and Kallar, form the Marava castes, who are quite dominant in the region variously known as Ramnad and the Maravar country.


== Religion ==
In Ramnad and the nearby areas of Pudukottai, Madurai, Salem, Namakkal, Tanjore and Trichy, they and their two fellow Maravar caste groups are prominent in their cult worship of the shrine at Oriyur that commemorates John de Britto, a 17th-century Portuguese Jesuit missionary and martyr. Raj says, "A notable feature of the Britto cult is that it is centered around caste identities rather than religious affiliation", and thus members of the caste-group, irrespective of their religious affiliation regard Britto as their clan-deity.Some Udayars are Roman Catholic Christians.

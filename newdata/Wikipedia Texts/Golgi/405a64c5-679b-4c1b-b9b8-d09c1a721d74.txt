Golgi I

A Golgi I (or Golgi type I) neuron is a neuron which has a long axon that begins in the grey matter of the central nervous system and may extend from there.
It is also known as a projection neuron. They include the neurons forming peripheral nerves and long tracts of brain and spinal cord.  Golgi II neurons, in contrast, are defined as having short axons or no axon at all. This distinction was introduced by the pioneering neuroanatomist Camillo Golgi, on the basis of the appearance under a microscope of neurons stained with the Golgi stain that he had invented. Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal postulated that higher developed animals had more Golgi type II in comparison to Golgi type I neurons. These Golgi type 2 neurons have star-like appearance.These Golgi Golgi type 2 neurons are found in cerebral and cerebellar cortices and retina.

1996 Hemsworth by-election

The Hemsworth by-election, 1996 was a parliamentary by-election held in England on 1 February 1996 for the House of Commons constituency of Hemsworth in West Yorkshire.
The vacancy was caused by the death of Hemsworth's Member of Parliament (MP), Derek Enright of the Labour Party. Enright, a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Leeds, had held the seat since a by-election in 1991.
The result was a Labour hold.
The election saw the first contest by the Socialist Labour Party, ahead of the party's official formation.  Based in nearby Barnsley, the organisation just saved its deposit, with 5.4% of the vote.

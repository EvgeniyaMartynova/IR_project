Uchimura Produce

Uchimura Produce (内村プロデュース), produced by Teruyoshi Uchimura, is a Japanese TV comedy program that aired from 2000 to 2005 on TV Asahi.


== Summary ==
The program that Teruyoshi Uchimura produces shows things with an original technique and concept every week.
There were only two regular performers: Uchimura and Ryō Fukawa at first. Later, a lot of young comedians appeared on the show, and Masakazu Mimura (Summers) became a regular.
This program was the stepping stone for the band consisting of Uchimura, Summers, TIM, and Ryō Fukawa, called NO PLAN. They released a single/DVD. NO PLAN had a live broadcast from Nakano Sunplaza in May 2004 and became successful.
This TV program was popular mainly with young men but finished regular broadcastings on September 26, 2005 as a result of TV Asahi reorganizing its late-night programs.
After the announcement to discontinue the program, demands for its continuation rushed into the official homepage. From the size of the reaction, Teruyoshi Uchimura posted a comment about the program's end on a homepage. Now, it sometimes is broadcast as a special program called "Uchimura Produce Special".
The DVD "Uchimura Produce ～Souseiki～"(内村プロデュース ～創世紀～, Uchimura Produce ～Creation period～) which contained episodes from the early period of the program in Japan was released on January 18, 2006 and jumped directly to first place first on the Oricon chart.
The movie PEANUTS, Uchimura' first directed movie, and in which a lot of performers from this TV program appeared, was released on January 28, 2006.

Gogo's Crazy Bones

Gogo's Crazy Bones (also referred to as Crazy Bones or Gogo's) are small, collectible figurines that became a popular fad during the late 1990s  through the 2000s. They are produced by Spanish company Magic Box Int., and PPI Worldwide Group, the sole distributor in North America.


== History ==
Crazy Bones was inspired by a children's game played in Ancient Greece and Rome called 'Astragal' (Knucklebones), where children played a similar game using sheep's knucklebones.
This ancient pastime is also known as Tabas.
Games played are reminiscent of marbles and jacks.
Crazy Bones is a modern version of this game, played with characters molded from plastic. There are hundreds of individual characters, each character having a unique face and name. Each series has a number of 'rare' (referred to as 'wanted', 'most wanted' or 'w' on trading cards.) pieces that are sought after by collectors and are sold on numerous websites for many times their original value.
Crazy Bones was launched in the United States by Peter Gantner after witnessing the success of Barcelona-based GoGos in Spain, which had sold over 350 million packs from its inception in 1996 to 1997.
Gantner formed Toy Craze in December 1997 with his brother David Gantner and businessman Scott Harris, and the company acquired the distribution rights in the US.
Some sources indicate Bill Flaherty, who became President of Toy Craze, also founded the company.
Gogos agreed to provide him with inventory with no upfront costs in return for 50% of all profits.
This deal was later renegotiated, and the manufacturer was later paid a royalty of sales.

A small company at the time of inception, Crazy Bones became a popular fad in the late 90s. The product was aggressively marketed to children, and promotional events took place in scout meetings, club groups, fairs, and shows, where free sample packs were distributed.
Toy demos have also taken place in SkyDome, where children were given free packs and taught how to play Crazy Bones.  This promotion was organized by the Canadian marketers of Crazy Bones, a joint venture by Wayne Fromm and Eric Segal of All 4 Fun Consumer Products Ltd. All 4 Fun Toy Products Ltd. also created a series of Crazy Bones for the Toronto Blue Jays, a cereal promotion with Cap'n Crunch and another with Wrigley. In 1999 and 2000 Fromm and Segal created one of Canada's largest collectible fad in the toy industry.. Fromm conceived of a musical band based on Crazy Bones in 2000, called B2Krazy.  This was a joint venture between Fromm, Segal and Iron Music.
Nearly four million free packs have been distributed.
Crazy Bones secured a number of high-profile partners, including McDonald's, which included the product as Happy Meal toys nationwide.
These Crazy Bones were significantly larger than the normal toys, possibly to reduce risk of choking among young children.Within two years, the company's revenues had grown to nearly $17 million. By favoring tours of scout meetings and the like over television and print advertisements, Toy Craze has also kept its marketing costs to around 10%.Crazy Bones were originally distributed in Canada through the Concord, Ontario-based company Playtoy Industries, where they enjoyed similar success.  Playtoy Industries declared bankruptcy in December 1999 and Wayne Fromm and Eric Segal catapulted Crazy Bones through a joint venture (www.frommtoys.com)
Crazy Bones enjoyed incredible popularity in the late 1990s. From 1998-2000, 31.5 million packages were sold.
Over 23 million figurines were sold in the UK and Spain in a recent relaunch between March and December 2008.Crazy Bones were banned in many schools, as they were blamed for encouraging theft, arguments, and in-class distractions.


=== Gogo's Crazy Bones in America ===


==== US ====
Crazy Bones was first released by an American company HotShots.HotShots later lost or sold the Crazy Bone patent. Toy Craze then obtained, distributed and licensed it, with Magic Box int. manufacturing them. 
The original bones were small plastic figurines made with faces. Each bone had a different name and personality. The long line of characters included the well known Jaws, Top Hat, and Eggy. Slight variations in design with a shift to a more spooky nature, of 59-78, led to production of the Mutant set of bones. On the other hand, Things, Ghost, Aliens, Buddies, and Sports were intended as each containing brand new characters.
"Sports" included 40 sports-uniformed Crazy Bones characters, whilst "Buddies" included 58 Gogos, each, like the past series, with its own function and design including: Liberty, Bookworm and Slick. In the "Things" series (60 units), all the bones are shaped like various everyday objects such as: a TV, a couch and a book, but as with the other series they had smiley faces. In the "Aliens" series, there are 60 different anthropomorphic figures of a classic grey, big eyed, alien. Some of the designs included: Salad Head (Caesar), Cyclops, Boris, Tut and others.
A "Third" series of Crazy Bones (in the old packaging and design) named "The New Generation" was later released, including 120 all new characters.  Some seem to be variations of the originals, or mutant original, but they are all meant as new characters to the series. A second sports series was released, but instead of uniformed characters, it features characters from the Original, Buddies, and Mutants series performing a sport (Eggy playing basketball or Speedy driving a car). There was also a series with magnetic characters, which are incredibly difficult to find. Rockers are music themed characters.
As of October 2010, the current distributor for Gogo's Crazy Bones in the US (as well as Canada) is Jonic Distribution North America.

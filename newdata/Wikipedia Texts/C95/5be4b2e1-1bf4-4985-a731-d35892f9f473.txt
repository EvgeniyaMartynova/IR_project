CFMC-FM

CFMC-FM, known on air as C95, is a Canadian radio station in the city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.  It shares studio space with sister stations CKOM and CJDJ at 715 Saskatchewan Crescent West, also the home of Rawlco Radio's Corporate Offices.


== History ==
Originally known on air as CFMC FM103, the station was purchased by Rawlco Communications in 1985, moved to 95.1 on the dial, and given the moniker C95.
In 2007, the station switched its format from hot adult contemporary to contemporary hit radio.  This format change happened right after Harvard Broadcasting was given approval to launch a CHR radio station (CFWD-FM).  In December 2012, shortly after CFWD-FM dropped its CHR format, CFMC-FM began to start leaning more towards a hot adult contemporary format again, ultimately taking on an adult CHR format.

List of The Amazing World of Gumball episodes

The Amazing World of Gumball is a British-American animated comedy television series created by Ben Bocquelet for Cartoon Network; its sixth season premiered on January 5, 2018. The Amazing World of Gumball revolves around the life of a 12-year-old cat named Gumball Watterson (Logan Grove, seasons 1 to 3; Jacob Hopkins, season 3 to 5; Nicolas Cantu, rest of season 5 onwards) and his frequent shenanigans in the fictional American world of Elmore. Throughout the series, he interacts with characters such as his former pet, brother and best friend Darwin (Kwesi Boakye, seasons 1 to 3; Terrell Ransom Jr., season 3 to 5; Donielle T. Hansley Jr, rest of season 5; Christian J. Simon, season 6 onwards), sister Anais (Kyla Rae Kowalewski), and parents Nicole and Richard (Teresa Gallagher and Dan Russell).
Bocquelet conceived The Amazing World of Gumball in 2007 while working as a development artist for Cartoon Network Studios Europe. Having been asked by the network to pitch an idea for a new series for Adult Swim, he took sketches of several unused characters he had created for commercials and started developing a concept for a new series based on them. As Cartoon Network was heavily interested in "family and school shows" at the time, Bocquelet decided to make the series a kid series called The Amazing World of Gumball which was a combination of both. He pitched the series to Daniel Lennard, vice president of Original Series and Development at Turner Broadcasting, who was impressed by the series' premise and ultimately greenlit its production. The first series to be greenlit by Cartoon Network Studios Europe, it first aired on May 3, 2011 with the episode "The DVD", which was watched by 2.120 million viewers in the United States.On June 2, 2014, Cartoon Network announced that the series had been renewed a fourth and fifth season. Both seasons combined consisted of 40 eleven-minute episodes.On June 22, 2016, Cartoon Network renewed the series for a sixth season which would consist of 44 episodes. On September 6, 2016, Ben Bocquelet announced he would be departing production of Gumball upon completing the sixth season; but production will continue without him. However, on October 7, 2018, he retweeted an article stating that the sixth season will be the last. However, on October 2018, the author of that article made a follow up article clarifying that there could still be more seasons. 
The series is rated TV-Y7-FV in the United States (and has a PG certificate in the UK on all DVD releases) for comedic fantasy violence, mild to moderate suggestive content (including use of sexual innuendo), rude (often dark) humor, and scenes of danger.Later in November 2019, a six-episode miniseries titled “Darwin's Yearbook” was announced.

APRA Awards (New Zealand)

The APRA Music Awards are several annual and two-yearly award ceremonies run in New Zealand by Australasian Performing Right Association to recognise songwriting skills, sales and airplay performance by its members. APRA hold the annual Silver Scroll Awards and song awards, selects an inductee into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame, and makes three professional development awards every second year. APRA also runs awards for its Australian members.


== APRA Silver Scroll Awards ==
Each year all songwriters that are members of APRA with a song on general release in the eligibility period can enter the APRA Silver Scroll Award. For the APRA Silver Scroll Award, a judging panel of APRA members decides a shortlist of songs, which is then voted on by APRA's wider membership of 10,000+ songwriters and composers. The votes of the wider APRA membership decide the winner and finalists for the APRA Silver Scroll Award. The APRA Silver Scroll Award is awarded purely on the basis of songwriting.

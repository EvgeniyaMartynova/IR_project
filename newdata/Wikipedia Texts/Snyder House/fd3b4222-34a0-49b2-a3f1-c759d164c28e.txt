List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto

This is a list of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto, that were constructed before 1920. The history of Toronto dates back to indigenous settlements in the region approximately 12,000 years ago. However, the oldest standing structures in Toronto were built by European settlers. Remains of a Seneca settlement may be found at the Bead Hill archaeological site, in eastern Toronto.
The first European structure built in Toronto was Magasin Royal, a French trading post established in 1720. In the 1750s, the French built several structures in the area (including Fort Rouillé), although the French would later destroy them in 1759, following their defeat at the Battle of Fort Niagara. In 1793, the government of Upper Canada arranged for the purchase of Toronto from the Mississaugas; in order to settle newly landed loyalist. Many of Toronto's oldest structures dates back to this early British settlement, known as York. The town of York was formally incorporated as the City of Toronto in 1834, with the passage of the Incorporation of the City of Toronto Act.

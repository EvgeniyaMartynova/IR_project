Harmony Company models

The Harmony Company of Illinois, United States, manufactured a wide variety of musical instruments which were popular during most of the 20th century.  This article is devoted to documenting these instruments.


== Numbering convention ==
Harmony's model numbers consisted of an 'H' followed by a 2 to 4 digit number.  The 'H' stood for the name of the company.


== Model and date stamps ==
Harmony hollow-body instruments were marked with inkstamps within the body of the instrument.  A model/batch number of the form nnnnHmmmm where 'nnnn' is a batch number and 'mmmm' is a model number ('6072H950' for example would be an H950 model).  They were also date stamped using an 'F' for instruments manufactured during the first half of the year and an 'S' for those built in the second half, and a 2 digit year code. ('F-45' would indicate the instrument was manufactured in the first half of 1945).


== OEM models ==
Harmony was an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for several other brands, most notably Silvertone. The OEM models were typically very similar to Harmony instruments but with cosmetic differences (e.g., finish color).
Pickups for almost all Harmony electric guitars and basses were manufactured by Rowe Industries in Toledo, Ohio, from the mid 1940s until the closure of Harmony in the mid 1970s.

Anistreplase

Anistreplase is a thrombolytic drug. It is also known as anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) after its components.Anistreplase has been developed by Beecham as Eminase. It is also known as anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC)


== Mechanism ==
It is a complex of purified human plasminogen and bacterial streptokinase that has been acylated to protect the enzyme's active site. When the drug is administered, the acyl group gets hydrolyzed, thereby freeing the activator complex. It converts plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn degrades fibrin (blood clots) to fibrin split products.

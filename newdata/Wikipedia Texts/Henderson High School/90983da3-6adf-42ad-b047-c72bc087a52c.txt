== Facilities ==
Henderson High School was the first school constructed to a new common design plan, which were used during the post-World War II period to speed up secondary school construction. The "Henderson type school" was a single-storey all-timber school design, with long wings of classrooms facing onto corridors, fanning out from a central spine. It was a derivative of the "Naenae type school" (after its first use at Naenae College in Lower Hutt), which with two stories and mixed concrete and timber construction was too slow for a major school building programme. The Henderson school design lasted four years, 1953 to 1956, before it was replaced in 1957 with a new design centred on self-contained classroom blocks. Other school in the Auckland area built to the Henderson design include One Tree Hill College, Rangitoto College and Selwyn College.The school has a small independently owned and operated tuck shop.


== International students ==
Henderson High School each year gets students from different countries, which include Brazil, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Japan, Korea, Macau, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.In 2018 three students at the Henderson High had converted bicycles into electric bicycles.

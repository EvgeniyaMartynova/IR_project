Museum Kampa

Museum Kampa is a modern art gallery in Prague, Czech Republic, showing Central European, and in particular Czech work. The pieces are from the private collection of Meda Mládek, wife of Jan V. Mládek.
The museum opened in 2003 and is housed in the Sova's Mills on the eastern bank of the Kampa Island on the River Vltava.
There is a large sculpture of a chair by Magdalena Jetelová outside the museum, which is a prominent landmark visible from across the Vltava.

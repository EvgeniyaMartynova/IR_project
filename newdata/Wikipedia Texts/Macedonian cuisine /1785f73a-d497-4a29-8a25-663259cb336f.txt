Macedonian cuisine (Greek)

Macedonian cuisine (Greek: Μακεδονική κουζίνα) is the cuisine of the region of Macedonia in northern Greece. Contemporary Greek Macedonian cooking shares much with general Greek and wider Balkan and Mediterranean cuisine, including dishes from the Ottoman past. Specific influences include dishes of the Pontic, Aromanian, Slavic, Armenian and Sephardi Jewish population. The mix of the different people inhabiting the region gave the name to the Macedonian salad.


== History ==


=== Ancient and Byzantine periods ===

The letters of Lynceus of Samos include reference to a Macedonian dish organized by Lamia of Athens for her lover Demetrius I Poliorcetes. Constants on menus across the centuries have been seafood and meats. At the wedding feast by Caranus referred to in Hippolochus's letter, around the 4th or 3rd century BC, grilled fish, eggs, oysters, orioles and a host of roasted delicacies were served.


=== Ottoman and Modern periods ===
A continuation from ancient days are dishes such as lamb cooked with quince or various vegetables and fruits, goat boiled or fried in olive oil: modern recipes from Kavala to Kastoria and Kozani offer lamb with quince, pork with celery or leeks.
The arrival of Greek refugees from Asia Minor and Constantinople in the early 20th century brought also Anatolian and Constantinopolitan elements in the cuisine of the region. 
Some current specialties are trahanas with crackling, phyllo-based pies (cheese, leek, spinach) and meat plates (such as pork, wild boar and bubalus). 
Favourites are tyrokafteri (Macedonian spicy cheese spread) and soupies krasates (cuttlefishes in wine). Unlike Athens, the traditional pita bread for the popular souvlaki usually is not grilled but fried. (Information included from 'Greek Gastronomy', GNTO, 2004)
Various products are produced from the buffalo meat. There is breeding especially around Lake Kerkini.

The first settlement at Big Springs was made in the fall of 1854.  The town was founded by William Harper and John Chamberlain but had always been a popular watering hole along the Oregon Trail. It was named from the mineral springs nearby.  On September 5, 1855, Big Springs was home to a free-state convention in which determined men vowed to give their lives to defend their homes from border ruffians from Missouri. The first sermon was preached in 1855 by Reverend W.A. Cardwell in the log home of Ephraim Banning. The first church was built a year later. Also in 1856, the first post office was established, as well as the first schooling took place then in the town hall. The post office was discontinued in 1903. The population did not grow, but hovered around 40 people, as there was no railroad running through the town.

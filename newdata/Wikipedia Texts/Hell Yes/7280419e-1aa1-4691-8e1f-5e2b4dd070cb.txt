Hell Yes (EP)

Hell Yes (sometimes known as Ghettochip Malfunction, or GameBoy Variations) is the first official remix album, second official, and third overall EP by American artist Beck. It features several songs from Beck's 2005 album, Guero. The prominent feature of the EP is the persistent use of sound effects and tones generated from 8-bit or 16-bit video game systems, giving the songs a somewhat 1980s retro or chiptune feel. The two artists who are responsible for the songs in the 4-song extended play are 8-Bit and Paza Rahm, both of whom are little-known artists.

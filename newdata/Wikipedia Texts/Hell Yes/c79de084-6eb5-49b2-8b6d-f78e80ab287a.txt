== Music video ==
The music video for "Hell Yes" features four QRIOs, developed by Sony Japan. The QRIO is designed to carry on conversations, adapt to its environment, and mimic human movements, including dance routines. Shots of Beck performing this song are imposed on the wall behind the QRIOs. At the time of the video shoot, there were only four working QRIOs in the world—all of which appear in this video. The video was directed by Garth Jennings.

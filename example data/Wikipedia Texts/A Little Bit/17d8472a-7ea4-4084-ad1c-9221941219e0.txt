The video for the single "Forever Not Yours" was shot in Havana, Cuba. The video was directed by Harald Zwart (who also directed the "Velvet" video) and the storyline is based on the story of Noah's Ark and today's celebrities. Look-alikes of Desmond Tutu, Madonna, and Queen Elizabeth II are included, among others.
The video for the single "Lifelines" features segments from the 1991 short film Året gjennom Børfjord, also known as A Year Along the Abandoned Road. In the short film a camera moves through a small village in Finnmark while the seasons change.

The cover for the album was made by Andy Frank during the shooting of Forever Not Yours video in Havana. It is an edited image of Jose Marti Parque Stadium. In the booklet there are also images of old theatre and old American car as well as other views which can be found on the streets of Havana.

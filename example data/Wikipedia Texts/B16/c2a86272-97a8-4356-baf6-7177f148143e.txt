Bundesstraße 16

The Bundesstraße 16 or B 16 is one of the German federal highways crossing southern Bavaria from east to south. It runs from the Bavarian Forest to Regensburg and then along the river Danube to Günzburg. From Roding to Regensburg the highway is developed without any junctions and is in parts signed as B 16n. From Günzburg to Füssen the B 16 runs from north to south.

Since a few years there are attempts to develop this Bundesstraße without any junctions and crossings of towns and villages. Therefore, many drivings were built. Today there are main through-roads only between Lauingen and Donauwörth. Several drivings are in planning:

Dillingen an der Donau: the plan is ready since 2009/0717; start of construction in the year 2010; completion in the year 2012;
Höchstädt an der Donau: in planning; start of construction not before the year 2012;
Tapfheim: preparatory planning

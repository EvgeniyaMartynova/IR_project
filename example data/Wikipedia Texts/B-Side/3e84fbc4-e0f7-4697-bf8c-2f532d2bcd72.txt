B-Sides (Avril Lavigne album)

B-Sides, also known as Let Go: B-Sides, is a promotional album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne. It was published before debut album Let Go by Arista Records in 2002. The compilation contains demo and original tracks not included in the final Let Go release. The songs were written and produced in 2001 under the management of Nettwerk in Los Angeles by Lavigne, the production team The Matrix and songwriter Cliff Magness after Arista sent her to McBride CEO of Nettwerk in the attempt to fit her image and attitude with her voice. Though Lavigne would release Let Go through Arista, she continued with Nettwerk for her management.

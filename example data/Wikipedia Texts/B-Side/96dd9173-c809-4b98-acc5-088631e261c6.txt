B-Sides (Pin-Up Went Down EP)

B-Sides is an EP by French avant-garde metal band Pin-Up Went Down, and their third release overall. It was independently-released by the band on 10 November 2012, being available for download on their official Bandcamp page. As its name implies, it is a collection of outtakes from their two studio albums, 2 Unlimited and 342, and at the time was meant to serve as a teaser for their unreleased third studio album, Perfreaktion.

A Girl Like You (The Smithereens song)

"A Girl Like You" is a song by the American alternative rock group The Smithereens. It is the first single released in support of their third album 11.
The song was to be used in the film Say Anything..., but it was ultimately cut from the film because the producers believed the song revealed too much of the story. Pat DiNizio stated that he wrote the lyrics with having a separate meaning from the movie in mind.
Backing vocals on the song were provided by Maria Vidal.

Polly Adler

Pearl "Polly" Adler (April 16, 1900 – June 9, 1962) was an American madam and author of Russian-Jewish origin, best known for her work A House Is Not a Home, which was posthumously adapted into a film of the same name.


== Early life ==
The oldest of nine children of Gertrude Koval and Morris Adler, Polly was the daughter of a tailor who travelled throughout Europe on business. Her early education was from the village rabbi. Polly Adler emigrated to America from Yanow, Russia, near the Polish border at the age of 12 just before World War I. The war stopped her family from joining her. She lived for a time with family friends in Holyoke, Massachusetts, where she cleaned house and attended school, and at age 14, she began working in the local paper mill; the following year she moved to Brooklyn, living for a time with cousins.She worked as a seamstress, at clothing factories, and sporadically attended school. At 19, she began to enjoy the company of theater people in Manhattan, and moved into the apartment of an actress and showgirl on Riverside Drive in New York City. It was at this apartment that she was introduced to a local bootlegger and gangster, who offered to pay Adler if she would allow him and his girlfriend to use her apartment. She began to procure for him and his friends, and became successful as a madam.


== Bordello owner ==
She opened her first bordello in 1920, under the protection of mobster Dutch Schultz and a friend of mobster Charles "Lucky" Luciano. One building in which she plied her trade was The Majestic at 215 West 75th Street, designed by architects Schwartz and Gross and completed in 1924 which contained hidden stairways and secret doorways. Her brothel's patrons included Peter Arno, Harold Ross, Desi Arnaz, George S. Kaufman, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Milton Berle, John Garfield, New York City mayor Jimmy Walker, and mobster Dutch Schultz. It has been theorized that the New York State Supreme Court justice Joseph Force Crater, missing since Aug. 6, 1930, died in Polly Adler's brothel.
Adler was a shrewd businesswoman with a mind for marketing. She determined that gaining publicity would be to her advantage, and she cultivated newspaper coverage by dressing flamboyantly, making grand appearances at nightclubs, and drawing attention to her beautiful employees. She also made large bribes to city and law enforcement officials to keep her business open.In the early 1930s, Adler was a star witness of the Seabury Commission investigations and spent a few months in hiding in Florida to avoid testifying. She refused to give up any mob names to the Seabury Commission when apprehended by the police. She survived by providing half of her income to her underworld safety net, and closed her business. She retired in 1944.
Adler attended college at age 50, and wrote a bestselling book, ghost written by Virginia Faulkner, A House Is Not a Home (1953), allowing her to live off the proceeds. She died in Los Angeles in 1962. A House Is Not a Home was made into a movie two years later, starring Shelley Winters as Adler. Her notoriety led her to be included in Cleveland Amory's 1959 Celebrity Register.

Shelley Winters portrayed Adler in the 1964 film version of Adler's book. The 1989 Perry Mason TV-movie Musical Murder revolved around a faux-musical based on Adler.

The television show M*A*S*H episode "Bulletin Board" features a party/picnic called the "First Annual Polly Adler Birthday Cook-out Picnic and Bar-B-Que", with all proceeds going to Sr. Teresa's Orphanage. The picnic scene climaxes with a tug of war between the officers and enlisted men; in the episode "Goodbye, Cruel World", Colonel Potter asks "Why does my company clerk's office look like Polly Adler's parlor?" after Corporal Klinger does some redecorating with items sent from home.

After signing to the newly formed Stroudavarious Records in 2008, Morgan began work on her first studio album since 2004's Show Me How. An album titled I Walk Alone was available through Morgan's fan club and at concerts, but its release to the public was delayed. Instead, A Moment in Time, which consists of traditional country songs, was released on October 27, 2009. The album features fourteen covers, including Mel Street's "Borrowed Angel," Glen Campbell's "By the Time I Get to Phoenix," and Freddie Hart's Number One hit "Easy Loving." Two songs on the album are duets, Tracy Lawrence ("After the Fire Is Gone") and Raul Malo ("Easy Lovin'").

In promotion for the album, Morgan made appearances on CMT and GAC throughout October. She appeared on Daytime on October 29, 2009, and she also appeared on The Daily Buzz on November 3, 2009. She also appeared as a celebrity guest judge on an episode of Iron Chef America. In 2010, Morgan played the role of "Lula" in the Broadway adaptation of Pure Country, the 1992 film starring George Strait.

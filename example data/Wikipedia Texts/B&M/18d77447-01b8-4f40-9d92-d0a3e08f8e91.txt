== History ==

The business was founded by Malcolm Billington as Billington & Mayman and the first store opened in Cleveleys, Lancashire, United Kingdom in 1978 and was acquired by Simon and Bobby Arora from Phildrew Investments in December 2004.In September 2006, the business saw significant growth, by acquiring the GlynWebb chain of Do It Yourself (DIY) stores, and converting them into the B&M Homestore format. The company also acquired a number of former Kwik Save, Woolworths and Au-Naturale stores.The business moved into a new office and modern 620,000sq ft distribution centre based in Speke, Liverpool in 2010, and new operations, logistics and finance directors joined the business in 2011. In May 2011, B&M also purchased a number of Focus DIY stores.In December 2012, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, one of the world’s leading private equity funds, acquired a significant stake in B&M, and Sir Terry Leahy and Vindi Banga joined the Board of Directors.In March 2014, the business acquired a majority stake in German discount retailer Jawoll, and then opened a new 500,000 sq ft distribution centre in Speke, Liverpool. In June 2014, the business was the subject of an initial public offering. However, upon detailed analysis by the Columbia Business school, it was found the IPO of B&M was overhyped due to an already saturated market in the UK.In November 2014, the business opened its 400th store (in Stockport) and claimed to serve in excess of three million customers every week.During July 2017, the company completed the acquisition of the smaller frozen food store chain Heron Foods for £152 million.


== Operations ==
B&M's strategy for acquiring products requires it to purchase directly from factories, or to seek overproduction and bulk buy opportunities, which means the retailer may make less profit by selling these items more cheaply than the competition, but makes up for it with the significant volumes being sold.Up to 30% of B&M's stock is sourced and purchased directly from China, though the retailer believes it can offset the higher import costs by increased sales volumes. Less than 10% of their products are sold for £1, giving them an advantage over single-priced competitors such as Poundland and Poundworld.Since September 2012, some stores have also been selling National Lottery goods.

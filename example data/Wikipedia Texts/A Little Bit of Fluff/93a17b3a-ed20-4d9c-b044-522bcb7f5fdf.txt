== Critical reception ==
Amongst contemporary reviews, The Derbyshire Advertiser noted "a riot of extraordinary and mirth-provoking scenes, and during its projection large audiences were continually laughing in the hearty manner that tells of real appreciation and enjoyment.  Ernest Thesiger, as Bertram Tully, was the outstanding character of the film, and his facial expressions were truly wonderful achievements”; while Cinema Chat wrote, "It’s a perfect scream from start to finish, and the acting in several of the ludicrous scenes is clever - that’s the very word for it.  We believe that this is Ernest Thesiger’s first appearance in the movies.”

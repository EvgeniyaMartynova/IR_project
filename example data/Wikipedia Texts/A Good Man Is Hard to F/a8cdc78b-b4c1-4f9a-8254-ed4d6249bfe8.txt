"A Good Man Is Hard to Find" is a song written by African-American songwriter and later actor Eddie Green, and first published in 1917.  It was first recorded by Marion Harris in 1919.  It is regarded as "one of the classic blues standards from the Roaring Twenties".


== History ==
The song was written by Green "in a bluesy style", and was first copyrighted in December 1917.  It was initially available as a piano roll.  By January 1919, the sheet music was reputed to have sold one million copies.  Green also used the song in a Broadway show in 1927.The recording by Harris – the first widely-known white singer to sing blues songs – for Victor Records was released in February 1919.  Other popular early recordings were made by Wilbur Sweatman's Original Jazz Band (1919), Ernest Hare (1919), Ted Lewis (1928), and Bessie Smith (1928).  The song became the signature tune of Sophie Tucker, who also first sang it in 1919.Among later recordings of the song are those by Fats Waller (1939), Teresa Brewer (1955), Brenda Lee (1959), Nancy Wilson (1962), Alberta Hunter (1980), Frank Sinatra (1984), and Maria Muldaur (2007).  There are at least 150 recorded versions of the song.The inversion of the phrase, as "A hard man is good to find", is generally attributed, though with some uncertainty, to Mae West.

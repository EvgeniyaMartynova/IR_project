Fulton Street Line (Brooklyn surface)

The Fulton Street Line or East New York Line was a streetcar line in Brooklyn, New York City, running mainly along Fulton Street between Fulton Ferry and East New York. In 1941, the streetcar line was replaced by the B25 bus route, operated by the New York City Transit Authority.


== Route description ==
The B25 bus route runs along Old Fulton Street and Fulton Street between Fulton Ferry and the Broadway Junction subway station (A, ​C​, J​, L​, and Z) in East New York, except in Downtown Brooklyn, where a block of the street past Borough Hall is closed. Along the way, subway transfers can be made at Court Street–Borough Hall (2, ​3​, 4, ​5​, N, R, and ​W), Jay Street–MetroTech (A, ​C​, F, <F>​​, N, R, and ​W), DeKalb Avenue (B, ​D, ​N, ​Q, ​R, and ​W), and at various points along the IND Fulton Street Line. This is based out of East New York Bus Depot.

Type B ship

The Type B ship is a United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) designation for World War II barges. Barges are very low cost to build, operate and move. Barges were needed to move large bulking cargo. A tug boat, some classed as Type V ships, could move a barge, then depart and move on to the next task. This meant the barge did not have to be rushed to be unload or loaded. Towards the end of the World War 2, some ships that had not been completed in time for the war were converted to barges. US Navy barges are given the prefix: YWN or YW. Due to shortage of steel during WW2, Concrete Ship Constructors were given contracts to built concrete barge with the prefix YO, YOG, YOGN and some named after elements, built in 1944 and 1945.

=== Freight Barges -YF - YFN ===
Most YFN barges were not self-propelled and most YF were self-propelled. A YFN could carry a load of 550 long tons. YFN were near shore with a steel hull. They worked in harbors, rivers and other protected waters.  They were 110 foot long, with a 32-foot beam and maximum draft of 8 feet.  
The Pacific Bridge Company built 27 YFN Freight Barges in 1943: YFN 576 to YFN 603. Pollock-Stockton Shipbuilding Company built: FN 619 to FN 742 YFN 998 to YFN 1016.


=== Refrigerated Freight Barges YFR - YFRN ===
Most YFRN Barges were not self-propelled and YFR Barges were self-propelled. Olson & Winge of Seattle WA made 10 YFRN: YFRN-833 to YFRN-841 in 1943 for the war. Defoe Shipbuilding Company of Bay City, Michigan build three: YFR-888, YFR-889 and YFR-890 in 1945. Long Beach Naval Shipyard of Long Beach, California built the YFRN-997 in 1945. A few barges were coveted to refrigerated barges, also called a reefer barge. 


=== Repair Barges ===

Repair Barges type TR, YRB, YRBM, YRDH, YRDM, YRR, LBE were built for World war 2. Repair Barge were self sustaining, 530 tons and 153 feet long built in 1944. They had a beam with of 36 feet and draft of 6 feet. Repair Barge had a machine shop, living accommodations. They repaired small boats and craft. The barge had generators, distilling plant, air compressor and steam boiler, The living space had bed berths, mess hall to support a crew of 48 men: 47 enlisted one Chief petty officer.
Floating Workshops are YR, 96 built, 24 built before ww2

Radiological Repair Barges are YRR, 14 built. Used to support nuclear plant overhauls of nuclear ships and submarines, also refueling and decontamination of used equipment.
LBE Landing Barge, Emergency repair used in WW2 to repair landing crafts.


=== Barracks Barge ===
US Navy Barracks Barges, also called berthing barge was 1,300 tons and 261 feet long. Used for use as a temporary barracks for sailors or other military personnel. A barracks ship also were used as a receiving unit for sailors who need temporary residence prior to being assigned to their ship. Barracks Barge are a type of auxiliary ship, called a APL for auxiliary personal living.
APB-35 to APB-51, Barracks Ships are propelled Barracks Ship built in 1944. APB has a full load displacement of 2,190 tons. APB are Benewah-class barracks ships, a sample is USS Benewah.

WW2 armament was four 20mm guns. Crew complement quarters could hold 71 officers and 583 troops. Some are still in use. Sample see USS Mercer (APL-39).
APL-59 to APL-72 are post WW2 Barracks Ships.


=== Landing Barge, Kitchen ===
Landing Barge, Kitchen or (LBK) was a landing craft used to support amphibious landings in North Western Europe during and after the Normandy invasion in the Second World War. Its primary purpose was to provide hot meals to the crews of the many minor landing craft not fitted with galley facilities. Constructed of steel, this shallow-draft lighter had storage and serving space to feed 900 men for one week. The kitchen capacity was able to provide 1,600 hot meals and 800 cold meals a day. Used by both the US and British on D-Day.  


=== Landing Barge, Vehicle ===
Landing Barge, Vehicle (LBV 1, mark 1) was a barge with a ramp added to load and unload vehicles like: jeeps and trucks during World war 2. A nine foot, four inch ramp was added to the stern of the barge for loading and unloading. LBV 2, mark 2, had an engine that could move the LBV up to 4 1/2 knots. Powered by 2 Chrysler RM Gas engines.  Used by both the US and British on D-Day. Built is three sizes: small (s) 70 feet long , medium (m) 78 feet long and large (l) 82 feet long. Each had a draft of about 4 feet loaded. 


=== Landing Barge, Oiler ===
Landing Barge, Oiler (LBO) use to store fuel oil or diesel fuel to fuel landing crafts. Had a 40 ton fuel tank, with two compartments and an engine that could move it up to 4 1/2 knots. Used by both the US and British on D-Day.


=== Landing Barge, Water ===
Landing Barge, Water (LBW) a barge (LBV2) with a 33 ton fresh water tank and an engine that could move it up to 4 1/2 knots. For the support of landing in World war 2. Used by both the US and British on D-Day. 


=== Landing Barge, Flak ===
Landing Barge, Flak (LBF) a Landing Barge, Vehicle with a 40mm anti-aircraft gun, manned by a crew of 5 army men. Also had Two 20-mm Hispano AA guns or two twin Lewis guns. The LBF were 60 to 90 feet long. Could also transport 15 troops. Used by both the US and British on D-Day. 


=== Concrete Barge ===
Built by Concrete Ship Constructors in National City, California in 1944 and 1945. These were a type of concrete ship. Steel shortages led the US military to order the construction of small fleets of ocean-going concrete barge and ships. Typical Displacement: 5,636 long tons (5,726 t), full load: 12,910 tons. Length:366 ft 4 in (111.66 m),  beam: 54 ft (16 m), draft: 26 ft (7.9 m), crew 52 officers and men. Ship armament 1 to 4 Ã— 40 mm AA gun Concrete Ship were fitted as needed some had diesel-electric power generators for refrigeration or tool use. Other were used to store fuel of water up to  60,000 barrels. Some were used for water distilling. Other were the Quartermaster's general store. 
Type MC B7-A2 tank barges made by Concrete Ship Constructors Inc in National City CA.B7-A2 were 5,786 deadweight tons concrete barges.

=== Concrete ===

Concrete Barges were used in WW1. Louis L. Brown built concrete barges at Verplank in New York.
YC-516 - Barge # 1 (Coal Barge #516), built 1918.
YC-442 - Barge # 442 - Built 1918, displacement 922 tons.

== United Kingdom ==
Thames lighters, or dumb barge, were non-self-propelled barges. The original Thames barges are  sailing vessels, many were converted for the war. LB or landing barges were used, some had ramps added and were called LBR or Landing Barge, Ramped. Some had engines and rudder added to be called LBV or Landing Barge Vehicle. They were used for different task: Landing Barges Oiler (LBO), Water (LBW), Kitchen (LBK) and Emergency Repair (LBE), Landing Barges Flak (LBF) and Gun (LBG). There was also one Landing Barge Cable (LBC). Many were used to for supplies to Normandy.


== Current barge classes ==
Type B I barge hull is designed to carry products which require the maximum preventive design to ensure no uncontrolled release cargo to the water or atmosphere.
Type B II barge hull. Barge hulls classed as Type II are those designed to carry products which require substantial preventive measures to ensure no uncontrolled release cargo to the water or atmosphere. But if released to the water would not make a long lasting public hazard.
Type B III barge hull. Barge hulls classed as Type III are those designed to move products of minor hazard and thus need less degree of control.

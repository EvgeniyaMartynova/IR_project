A New World (EP)

A New World is an EP by Ronnie Drew, produced by Phil Coulter. It was released through the Sunday World newspaper prior to the release of Drew's album There's Life In The Old Dog Yet in October 2006.  As well as the title track from the forthcoming album, the EP also featured Drew's interpretations of several of Coulter's own compositions, many of which had previously been recorded by other artists.  All of the recordings were new except for "Take Me Home", which features The Dubliners and which originally appeared on Phil Coulter's 1989 album Words & Music.

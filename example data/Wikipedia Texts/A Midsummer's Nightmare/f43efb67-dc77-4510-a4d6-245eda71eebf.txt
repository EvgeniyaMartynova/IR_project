A Midsummer's Nightmare (novel)

A Midsummer's Nightmare (1997) is a novel by Garry Kilworth. It is a comical parody of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.
In the book, Titania, Queen of elvesfolk, falls in love with a human baby â€“ a humorous contrast to A Midsummer Night's Dream where she falls in love with a half-man/half-donkey, and the elves have to leave Sherwood Forest in an old bus.

B-Sides and Rarities (Cake album)

B-Sides and Rarities (originally referred to as just Rarities on the band's website) is a rarities compilation album by Cake, an alternative rock band from Sacramento, California. It features several cover songs, including Black Sabbath's "War Pigs" and Barry White's "Never, Never Gonna Give You Up."
Originally, Columbia Records requested the band to release a greatest hits compilation, but the band promptly refused. During the legal fall-out, Cake formed its own record label, Upbeat Records, and released B-Sides and Rarities.A limited edition version of the album features a bonus track, a live version of "War Pigs" featuring Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips. It also features a scratch and sniff cover with "five different CD cover/scent variations (including red/fresh cut roses, brown/leather, green/fresh cut grass, purple/grape, and yellow/banana )."

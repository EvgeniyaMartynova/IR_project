== Critical reception ==
Billy Dukes of Taste of Country reviewed the single with favor, praising its summer vibe, writing The lyrics of “A Little More Love” fit Niemann’s brand of left-of-center country music perfectly, and his delightful exchanges with Brice are off the cuff, loose and inspired. Two singers who didn’t know each other as well as they do could not pull off the chemistry this funky beat is built on.

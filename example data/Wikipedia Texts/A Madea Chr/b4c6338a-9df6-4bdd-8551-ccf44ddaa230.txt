A Madea Christmas (musical play)

A Madea Christmas is a 2011 American musical play created, written, produced, and directed by Tyler Perry. It stars Perry as Madea and Cassi Davis as Aunt Bam.


== Plot ==
The members of the Mansell family—who can be identified without fear of stereotyping as mean mother Lilian (Chandra Currelley-Young), pompous father John (Maurice Lauchner), restless daughter China (Támar Davis), and virginal son Japan (Zuri Craig)—prepare for the holiday feast with the help of their saintly maid Margaret (Cheryl Pepsii Riley) and their mouthy chef Hattie (Patrice Lovely). Eager to impress China's super-rich beau/presumed fiancé Bobby (Shannon Williams), Lilian forces Margaret to work on Christmas instead of celebrating with her family. So China secretly invites the whole disreputable brood: Madea (Tyler Perry), Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis), and grown children Lucy (Alexis Jones), George (Jeffery Lewis), and Eric (Tony Grant). China was once in love with Eric; his reappearance lets her rethink her relationship with Bobby.

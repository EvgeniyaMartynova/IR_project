Divizia B

Liga II (also spelled Liga 2) is the second level of the Romanian football league system. The league changed its name just before the start of the 2006–07 season, previously being called Divizia B. It is currently sponsored by betting company Casa Pariurilor, and thus officially known as the Liga 2 Casa Pariurilor.

=== Multiple divisions ===
Since its inception in 1934, Liga II has had between 2 and 9 parallel divisions, with clubs divided based on a geographical criterion in order to avoid lengthy and expensive travels.
Generally, Seria I contains eastern teams while Seria II contains western sides, although clubs near the center of the country are allowed to choose in which series they will compete.
The first six teams from each series will play a play-off for promotion to Liga I. The teams placed 7th to 12th will play in a Relegation play-out. The last two teams will be relegated to Liga III. The first team in each series will promote at the end of the season to the Liga I and the teams placed on 12th place will play another match to decide who is the 5th team that will be relegated to Liga III.
Until the 2012–13 season Liga II had 2 groups of 16 teams each. At the end of the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons the last five teams were relegated.


=== Single division ===
Starting with the 2016-17 season, Liga II has a single division of 20 teams.

Children's Film Foundation

The Children's Film Foundation (CFF) is a non-profit-making organisation which makes films for children in the United Kingdom, typically running for about 55 minutes.


== History ==
It was founded in 1951. For 30 years it was subsidised by the Eady Levy - a tax on box office receipts, but this was abolished in 1985. It made a few further films in the mid-1980s, by which time it had been renamed the Children's Film and Television Foundation. Many of its films, dating back to the 1960s, were shown on the BBC in the 1980s, in the Friday Film Special strand. It made no films of its own since the mid-1980s, but it survived under its revised name, and in recent years has provided funding for other projects.
Frank Richard Wells (1903–82), second son of H. G. Wells and Amy Catherine Robbins, was a main executive at the CFF.In 2012 The Children's Film and Television Foundation changed its name and broadened its role to become the Children's Media Foundation.Its archive is now curated by the British Film Institute.

À la Carte (Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung album)

A la Carte is the fourth album to be released by Austrian band Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung (EAV) in 1984.
A la Carte is quite a well known French expression (meaning according to the card) which is used worldwide.  The album cover is a satirical take on this, as it shows a green pig's head, wearing headphones and eating a vinyl disc.  
This album was released a few times in Germany and The Netherlands.

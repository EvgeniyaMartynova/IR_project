== Overview ==
In 2006, after Arab Strap had split up after ten years together, Malcolm signed to Full Time Hobby and recorded A Brighter Beat. Malcolm has commented on the album, saying

If I was forced to describe it, which I am, I'd probably say it was a pop album for people who hate pop music. Or maybe I'd describe it as love songs for depressed people who find it hard leaving the house sometimes and worry too much about dying and the consequences of their daily actions and thoughts to be able to enjoy life fully.

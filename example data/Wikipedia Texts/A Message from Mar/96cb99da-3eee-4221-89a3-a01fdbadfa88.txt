A Message from Mars (1913 film)

For the 1903 New Zealand film version of the play, see A Message from Mars.A Message From Mars (1913) is a British science fiction film. In September 2014, the British Film Institute announced that they were putting the restored feature film online on their website.
The restored version is longer, and restores the original tinting and toning of the film. According to the BFI website, the plot (see below) is very similar to that of the Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol.

Parker is engaged to Minnie Templer (Bell), but Minnie has discovered Parker's selfishness and she is on the brink of calling off the engagement.
However, on Christmas Eve, a messenger from Mars comes to Earth to show Parker the error of his ways. The two of them become invisible and eavesdrop on all the terrible—and true—things Parker's friends and family are saying about him.

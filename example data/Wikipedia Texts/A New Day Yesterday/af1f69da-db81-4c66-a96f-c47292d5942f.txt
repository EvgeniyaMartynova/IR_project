Joe Bonamassa recorded his debut album at Pyramid Recording Studios in Ithaca, New York, working with producer Tom Dowd, and engineers Alex Perialas and Jason Arnold.

"Miss You, Hate You" was released as the first single from the album in 2001, including a music video which received airplay on shows including Chicago, Illinois-based JBTV and Brockton, Massachusetts-based Rage. "Colour and the Shape" was issued as a promotional single in 2002.After an initial low-key release, A New Day Yesterday "caught the ears of veteran record executives", according to CNN's Simon Umlauf, and was rereleased in September 2001 by Medalist Entertainment. Later reissues would follow in 2004 and 2009 by J&R Adventures (Bonamassa's own record label), in 2005 by Provogue Records and in 2012 by Mascot Records. All later releases include the original full-length version of "Miss You, Hate You" as a bonus track.

=== Critical ===
A New Day Yesterday received positive reviews from critics. AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia described the album as "a fine debut by guitar ace Joe Bonamassa", claiming that it proves the guitarist and vocalist to be "much more than a traditional bluesman". Rivadavia highlighted several songs on the album, including "A New Day Yesterday", the cover of which he dubbed "a jaw-dropping performance", the singles "Miss You, Hate You" and "Colour and the Shape", which he described as a "jolting double whammy" and "the most obvious standouts", and "If Heartaches Were Nickels", which he suggested featured "a tense, riveting performance". In a review of the album's lead single "Miss You, Hate You", Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine praised Bonamassa as "a bold talent, who rises above narrow radio formatics", outlining that the song "throws in all the ingredients of a classic rock moment, led by a thrush of driving guitars ... and a vocal that sounds like sandpaper against velcro".

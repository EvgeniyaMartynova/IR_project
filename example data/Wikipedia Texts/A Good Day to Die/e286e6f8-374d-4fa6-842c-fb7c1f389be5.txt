Music for The Native Americans

Music for The Native Americans is a 1994 album by Robbie Robertson, compiling music written by Robertson and other colleagues (billed as the Red Road Ensemble) for the television documentary film The Native Americans.
The album was Robertson's first foray into writing music specifically inspired by his Mohawk heritage.

== Reception ==
In his review for AllMusic, Ken Dryden called it "a fine studio set" additionally commenting: "An always effective vocalist who provided her own top-notch accompaniment on piano, Horn's almost conversational style of singing works very well whether she is swinging an oldie like 'I'm Old Fashioned' or delivering a lush, infectious interpretation of a ballad like 'A Lazy Afternoon'."

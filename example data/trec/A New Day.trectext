A New Day...

A New Day... was a Las Vegas concert residency performed by Canadian singer Celine Dion at the 4,000-seat Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. It was created and directed by Franco Dragone (known for his work with Cirque du Soleil) and premiered on 25 March 2003. 90-minute event, A New Day... introduced a new form of theatrical entertainment, a fusion of song, performance art, innovative stage craft and state-of-the-art technology. Dion was originally contracted for three years (Dion received about $100 million, plus 50 percent of the profits during the three-year contract),  however, due to its immediate success, the show continued for an additional two years. A New Day... ended on 15 December 2007, after a 5-year run. A New Day ... is the most successful residency of all time, grossing over US$385 million ($465.2 million in 2018 dollars) and drawing nearly three million people to 717 shows.Dion returned to Las Vegas on 15 March 2011 to perform her new residency, Celine.


== Background and creation ==
The original inspiration for the show occurred when Dion and her husband René Angélil visited Las Vegas in 2000, at a time when she was taking a break to start a family, and they watched a performance of O by Cirque du Soleil at the Bellagio. Dion was so moved and impressed by O that she insisted on going backstage afterwards to get to know the performers. Franco Dragone in turn heard about Dion's favorable reception of his work, and several weeks later, wrote a letter to them to put forth the idea of an artistic collaboration. Angelil called Dragone, they arranged an in-person meeting, and A New Day... was the result.
Dion initially intended for the show to be named Muse, but the band of the same name owned worldwide performing rights. Dion offered $50,000 for the rights, but the band declined, with lead singer Matthew Bellamy explaining that he didn't want people to think they were Celine Dion's backup act.The Colosseum venue was built using fast-track construction processes in only about 140 days. The stage was designed to slope upward at 5.7 degrees away from the audience, to provide the best acoustics possible in a circular theatre. The other purpose of the sloped stage was to show lighting details, designs, and textures of the stage for Dion's show. This proved extremely hard on the dancers' bodies, and a few were forced to leave the show early as a result of their injuries.
The original plan for the stage backdrop/scenery was to simply use a giant video projector, but when the lighting designer, Yves Aucoin, pointed out that this would create unacceptable shadows when dancers ran in front of it, Angelil went back to Phil Anschutz, whose AEG Live was underwriting the production, and persuaded him to contribute an extra $10 million for the construction of the largest indoor LED screen in North America. The LED Screen was produced by Mitsubishi Diamond Vision LED Screens. This was a HDTV LED Screen Installation with an 8mm Display "Dot Pitch". The screen consisted of many separate LED panels put together. The stage backdrop/video content design of the show is done by Dirk Decloedt.
Celine and her family moved to a house in Lake Las Vegas, located in Henderson, Nevada where they lived during the five years of the show.


== Critical reception ==

The year the show opened, A New Day... received mostly mixed reviews in the press, commenting on how there was not enough of a balance between concert and theater.  In TheaterMania.com, an article by Christine Westley praised the sets but wrote that Dion's performance was "inconsequential at best...  The most uncomfortable moments come when the music stops, the dancers disappear, and it's just Dion and her audience. This is when the show's split personality truly emerges: Dragone's alternate world is gone and now we have a Celine Dion concert, during which the star attempts witty banter as her fans scream out the mandatory declarations "We love you, Celine!" and then hold their breath, waiting for her to stop talking and start singing again."Phil Gallo of Variety praised the sets like the former article, but criticized choices in covers.  He stated, "Her run through a nostalgic trio — Etta James' first hit, 'At Last,' Peggy Lee's version of 'Fever' and the Frank Sinatra-phrased 'I've Got the World on a String' — magnified her lack of soulfulness, but they did display her capacity for mimicry: She phrases everything exactly as her predecessors did.  For 'First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,' it appeared Dion and her musical director Claude (Mego) Lemay had the softness of Roberta Flack's original in mind. But they then go out on a bizarre limb, progressively bloating the arrangement and her vocal interpretation. Worse yet, Dion ascends 70 feet into the heavens with dancers all around her. Nice effect, but another song would be more appropriate for it....  It's conceivable that future audiences will have more rapport with Dion and her music than opening night's high rollers and invited guests. Dion never looked like she was struggling, but if she didn't ask for audience participation, she wasn't going to get any anyway."In the documentary, A New Day... The Secrets, included as a bonus in the Live in Las Vegas: A New Day..., Dion and Dragone commented on making changes to the show through the years to include more appearances of the band members, or to change Dion's look to make it more like what fans expected.The year when A New Day... was going to close, Mike Weatherford of Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote a positive review.  He stated how Dion "...grew into 'A New Day' over the years, and for better or worse the show evolved into more of the diva showcase people expected at the outset: an upscale pop show with some artsy flourishes, not the swing-for-the fences collaboration with Cirque du Soleil director Franco Dragone that often tried too hard.  Some early mistakes disappeared quickly. It's been a long time since Dion flew on a harness rigging, or dressed up like the "Pat" character on 'Saturday Night Live,' with slicked-back hair and hitched-up, man-boy suspenders.  Other changes replaced the audacious with safe and sure-footed, but more ordinary choices. The show now opens with—wouldya believe it? -- the title song 'A New Day' instead of the solitary, a capella take on "Nature Boy." The standards "Fever" and "At Last" were replaced in May 2006 with a now-common tech trick, splicing in Frank Sinatra to help croon 'All the Way.'  And the homestretch now celebrates the cast as a bonded unit with the Ike & Tina Turner classic 'River Deep—Mountain High.' Dragone would have found it cheesy back in '03. Now, he probably realizes the show needed an energy that had been stifled in its overproduced infancy.  The world's largest hi-def screen no longer steals the show as it did before Best Buy shoppers knew the difference between a 720p and 1080p TV. But Dragone's elegant spectacle still makes the jaw drop now and then."


== Broadcasts and recordings ==

The show was first filmed to serve as a TV Special for the opening night. However, Celine in Las Vegas, Opening Night Live included only 8 songs.
In autumn 2003 (26-30 November 2003), the show was filmed again and a DVD was scheduled to be released in autumn 2004. Firstly, in June 2004, a CD entitled A New Day... Live in Las Vegas (featuring 13 live songs) was released and included promotional information that a DVD was going to be released in autumn. This release was cancelled with no plans to release it in the future. However, this DVD was shown to the audience during one of the shows when Celine was sick and couldn't perform.Reportedly, another DVD was recorded between 2005-2006 with Celine having long brown hair and new costumes as many different extracts have appeared.Finally, A New Day... was re-shot in high-definition during the 17–21 January 2007 week and released on DVD on 7 December 2007 and on Blu-ray Disc on 5 February 2008. The DVD represents the show as of January 2007.The two disc set, which contains more than 5 hours of never-before seen footage, including the concert and three exclusive documentaries: Because You Loved Me (A Tribute to the Fans), A New Day: All Access and A New Day: the Secrets, became very successful on the music DVD charts around the world.According to the Quebec press, Live in Las Vegas - A New Day ... was completely sold-out in the province less than a few hours after its release. In addition, Dion made history on 18 January 2008 when Live in Las Vegas - A New Day ... became the only music DVD to be certified triple diamond in Canada, selling over 300,000 units. Only five other DVDs have ever reached double diamond status in Canada. Dion's DVD also garnered the largest debut in Nielsen SoundScan history for a DVD-only release, with over 70,000 copies sold in its first week, which is something that has never occurred before in Canadian music history. Live in Las Vegas - A New Day ... held the number 1 position on the Music DVD Chart in Canada for many weeks after its release.
Outside Canada, the DVD peaked at number 1 in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, New Zealand and Estonia. It reached number 2 in Portugal and Sweden, number 3 in Argentina, Australia, Ireland and Greece, number 4 in Austria, number 6 in Italy and number 7 in Czech Republic. Live in Las Vegas - A New Day ... also debuted in the top 10 in Finland and Germany.
Nearly 500,000 copies of the DVD were sold worldwide in its first week of release. Live in Las Vegas - A New Day ... was certified 3x diamond in Canada, diamond in France, 4x platinum in Australia, platinum in Brazil, Portugal, Argentina and New Zealand, and gold in the Netherlands and Belgium. In Japan, it sold 30,000 copies during the first three months of its release. As of 26 September 2010, the DVD has sold 433,000 copies in the U.S. and has been certified 7x platinum (it is now eligible for 8x platinum after selling 400,000 copies).[16] According to Billboard, the DVD was the third best-selling music DVD of 2008 in the U.S. and the best-selling by a female artist.[17] At the end of 2009, the DVD was still charting in the top 10, being the tenth best-selling DVD in the U.S.

Even though the official DVD contains many extras, a lot of songs which were performed throughout the years have not been included:
"Nature Boy," "At Last," "Fever," "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", "Et je t'aime encore," "Have You Ever Been in Love", "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)", "God Bless America", "In Some Small Way",  "What a Wonderful World", "Can't Help Falling In Love", "Taking Chances" and "The Christmas Song".
In addition, two instrumentals: "A New Love" and "Aria Di Lucia De Lammermoor" have been omitted as well.

Audio versions of "Nature Boy", "At Last," "Fever" "Et je t'aime encore" and "What a Wonderful World" were included on the A New Day... Live in Las Vegas CD, released in June 2004

Various songs (both from the usual setlist and one-night only performances) have been broadcast during different TV programmes, promotional videos, etc.


== Set list ==

Additional notes

"Love Is All We Need" and "A New Day Has Come (Radio Remix)" were both rehearsed before the show's premiere but were never included in the actual show. The visuals for "A New Day Has Come" included giraffes.
Originally, during "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" Celine was flying while performing the song. Due to hernia issues, the song was then performed on stage to be finally cut in May 2004.
Initially, "Ammore Annascunnuto" was preceded by "Aria Di Lucia De Lammermoor" and thus performed in full. The instrumental interlude was cut when Celine stopped flying during "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" but performed the latter on stage. Since then, "Ammore Annascunnuto" served as an instrumental interlude with Celine appearing in the middle of the song and performing it in a shortened version.
Since 9 September 2006, Celine stopped performing "What a Wonderful World" but the song's instrumental was used as an outro. In the final year, it was replaced by "My Heart Will Go On" instrumental.
Since 10 November 2006, Celine started to leave the stage for the costume change near the end of "Love Can Move Mountains" which included then the rap parts of "Unison" performed by the band.
Taro Hakase, the original violinist in "To Love You More", joined Celine on stage to perform the song during the show on 7 July 2006.
David Foster joined Celine on the piano for "Because You Loved Me" during one of the shows in 2007. The performance was later included on Foster's DVD entitled "Hit Man: David Foster & Friends".

=== Early beginnings ===
Midnight Youth came together while at Rangitoto College in Auckland's North Shore with three members of the band playing together in New Zealand's high school Rockquest competition. Jeremy Redmore and Nick Campbell completed the group in mid-2006.
The band released two independent singles, "Supernatural" and "A New Day", in 2007 and played opening slots for Incubus, Ok Go and a re-formed INXS in their New Zealand shows. 
In 2008 they self-funded a trip to New York City to lodge and record with producer Terence Dover. With Hotbed Studios (vocals and bass) as their quarters and home base, Dover recorded them at studios across New York. Skyline Studios(Drums) in Manhattan, GödelString (Guitars, Drums, Vocals, Bass) in Brooklyn, The Buddy Project (guitars and vocals) in Queens and (Grand Piano) City College's Sonic Arts Center concert hall were all unique recording environments Dover selected for their debut record The Brave Don't Run.


=== Signing & debut album ===
After recording the album, the band signed with Warner Music NZ in September 2008 and released their third single, "The Letter", to widespread acclaim across New Zealand. The song became the band's first Top 40 hit in New Zealand in January 2009, eventually peaking at #19 on the NZ singles chart and spending 17 weeks in total inside the NZ Top 40.
Their follow-up single, "All On Our Own", debuted at #18 on the New Zealand RIANZ Singles Chart in March, 2009, and peaked at number six, after twelve weeks on the chart. The song went on to spend another 11 weeks inside the NZ top 40 and beat out international acts to be the most played song on NZ radio for 2009.The album spawned five singles in New Zealand in total: third single Learning To Fall was released in June 2009, its video filmed in Manhattan, New York, fourth single Cavalry spent seven straight weeks at number one on rock radio in New Zealand. 
Fifth single, Golden Love, initially gave the band exposure in the United States through a feature on the season finale of One Tree Hill in May 2010 before going on to have a second life after being featured in Korean TV drama Uncontrollably Fond in 2016. As of July 2018, the song has amassed over 8 million streams between Spotify and YouTube.
Midnight Youth's debut album, The Brave Don't Run, was released in New Zealand on 27 April 2009, and peaked at number two on the New Zealand Album Chart. The album was certified platinum in New Zealand in December 2009.
Midnight Youth were nominated for 8 awards in the 2009 New Zealand Music Awards, including Best Album "The Brave Don't Run", Best Single "All On Our Own" and Best Group. The band won the Best Rock Album award, Best Group award and Best Engineer Andrew Buckton.

Live in Las Vegas: A New Day...

A New Day... Live in Las Vegas is the first English-language live album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released by Columbia Records on 14 June 2004. It includes songs from Dion's Las Vegas residency show, A New Day.... The album also features studio recordings of two new tracks: "You and I" and "Ain't Gonna Look the Other Way". A New Day... Live in Las Vegas was certified Gold in the United States and Silver in the United Kingdom.


== Content ==
A New Day... Live in Las Vegas features thirteen live tracks from Dion's successful Las Vegas show, called A New Day... and two previously unreleased studio tracks: "You and I" and "Ain't Gonna Look the Other Way". It was also released with a bonus DVD containing 45-min documentary, called One Year... One Heart.
A New Day... Live in Las Vegas includes five live songs which weren't available on Dion's previous albums: "Fever", "I've Got the World on a String", "I Wish", "If I Could" and "What a Wonderful World". The studio versions of last two songs were included on her next album Miracle.
"If I Could" was originally recorded by Nancy Wilson on her Nancy Now! album in 1988. In 1993 Ray Charles covered it on My World, as well as Regina Belle on her album Passion. Barbra Streisand included the song on her Higher Ground album in 1997.
The French edition of A New Day... Live in Las Vegas contains "Contre nature" as a bonus track.
The originally scheduled Live in Las Vegas - A New Day... DVD release date (autumn 2004) was postponed because of changes and improvements made to the show since the initial filming. A New Day... was re-shot in high-definition during the 17–21 January 2007 week and released on 7 December 2007. The two disc DVD contains more than 5 hours of never-before seen footage, including the concert and three exclusive documentaries. Live performances of "Nature Boy", "At Last", "Fever", "Et je t'aime encore" and "What a Wonderful World" are available only on A New Day... Live in Las Vegas CD, as they were removed from the show at the time of filming the DVD.


== Critical reception ==
The album met with positive reviews. AllMusic said that "this live document of the Las Vegas show drives home the point that Celine is one of the most potent entertainers in adult contemporary music". According to them Dion is "equally as comfortable in high-tempo numbers chock-full of her signature vocal acrobatics as she is in quiet, contemplative moments. It's an ideal souvenir for those who have experienced the magic with their own ears and eyes. And while it's not the most definitive document of Dion's career, it certainly is a stirring testament to her accomplishments as the standard to whom most vocalists aspire".


== Commercial performance ==
A New Day... Live in Las Vegas has sold 530,000 copies in the United States and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It was also certified Silver in the UK. The album reached top ten in many countries, including number one in Greece and Quebec, number two in Canada, number four in Belgium Wallonia, number seven in Belgium Flanders, number nine in France, and number ten in the United States.


== Accolades ==

In 2005, A New Day... Live in Las Vegas was nominated for the Félix Award in category Anglophone Album of the Year.

Sonic Rush

Sonic Rush is a 2005 platform video game developed by Sonic Team and Dimps for the Nintendo DS as part of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series. It was released on November 15, 2005 in North America, November 18 in the PAL region, and November 23 in Japan. It is a 2D platform game, similar to earlier games in the series as well as later ones like Sonic Advance. Levels in the game are side-scrolling and displayed using both of the DS's screens. However, boss battles, the main characters' sprites, and a special stage are rendered in 3D, creating a 2.5D effect. The game's storyline follows the intertwining adventures of a new character, Blaze the Cat, and the series' main character, Sonic the Hedgehog. They respectively battle Doctor Eggman and his doppelgänger Eggman Nega at certain points.
The game was announced under the working title Sonic DS at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, and under Sonic Rush at E3 2005. The game's 2.5D format was based on Sonic Team's idea to combine elements from 2D and 3D games in the series. Upon release, Sonic Rush was well-received by critics, with praise stemming from the game's music and similarity to older games in the series and criticism stemming from its overall quickness. A sequel, Sonic Rush Adventure, was released in 2007.


== Gameplay ==

Sonic Rush is a 2D platform game, similar to earlier games in the series as well as later ones like Sonic Advance and Sonic Mania. The player controls either Sonic the Hedgehog or Blaze the Cat, who differ in terms of special abilities. In the tradition of past Sonic games, gameplay consists of moving quickly through levels, collecting rings and defeating enemies. The player collects rings as a form of health; when they are attacked by an enemy, their rings bounce in all directions. If they are hit by an enemy and have no rings, they lose a life. Both of the DS's screens are used to display the play area, with the player's character moving between them as necessary. Levels in the game are divided into "zones", each consisting of two acts of normal gameplay then a 3D boss battle. The course of the game differs depending on whether Sonic or Blaze is chosen; the seven zones are the same, but are accessed in different orders. During boss battles, Blaze fights Doctor Eggman and Sonic fights an Eggman doppelgänger called Eggman Nega. As the characters' stories progress, they meet each other several times and unite in the final zone that comes after the seventh. The game features special stages the player can access via certain handles in order to obtain the Chaos Emeralds. These Special Stages resemble those of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and utilises the DS' stylus controls.New features include a grading system that grades the player based on the time it takes for them to complete the level; they can return to levels later to try for a higher grade. There is a point system based on the one in Sonic Advance 2 but displaying points in multiple categories. There is also a "Tension Gauge" on the left side of the screen which is filled by doing tricks and defeating enemies. The energy it generates allows the player to use boosts of speed while moving; defeating enemies, moving through the level more quickly which results in more points and a higher grade, and when playing as Sonic, accessing the special stage. Although the game is primarily two-dimensional, there are three-dimensional elements which create a 2.5D effect. For the first time in the series, Sonic and Blaze's sprites are rendered in 3D.The game  has a two-player mode in which Sonic and Blaze race to the end of a chosen level from the game. There is also a feature in which players who own the game can send a demo of the game to other Nintendo DS users.


== Plot ==

Blaze the Cat is somehow pulled from her native dimension into Sonic's world. Her world had seven Sol Emeralds—similar to the Chaos Emeralds—but they were stolen by Doctor Eggman. She then makes it her goal to retrieve them; this is where Sonic meets her. While she is searching for the Sol Emeralds, Sonic is searching for the Chaos Emeralds, which have been stolen by Doctor Eggman Nega, Eggman's alternate counterpart from Blaze's dimension. Blaze meets Cream the Rabbit and is surprised by her politeness. Meanwhile, Miles "Tails" Prower learns that Blaze's and Sonic's Space-Time Continuum are merging somehow causing it to expand until it rips and everything disappears. Sonic grows suspicious of Blaze, and along with Tails, looks for her. Soon, after they find Blaze and Cream, Sonic questions Blaze about her nature, but she refuses to give any information and leaves with Cream. Sonic follows her to Eggman Nega's base, where it is revealed that Eggman and Eggman Nega are working together to collect both the Chaos Emeralds and the Sol Emeralds. Blaze declares that she is the only one who can save their worlds, without anyone's help. Sonic and Blaze fight each other, until Sonic wins the fight and Blaze realizes the error of her ways.
After Eggman kidnaps Cream, Blaze goes after him while Sonic takes on Nega. Sonic collects the last of the seven Chaos Emeralds; and meets Blaze, who fails to protect the Sol Emeralds. Sonic and his friends help Blaze realize the meaning of friendship and she turns into Burning Blaze—apparently her answer to Sonic's Super Sonic form—while Sonic turns into Super Sonic. They fight Eggman and Eggman Nega and defeat them. The two worlds are restored, forcing Blaze to return to her own world. As she flies there, she realizes that she truly understands her powers. Later, on Sonic's planet, Cream is crying because she misses Blaze, but Sonic tells her that Blaze promised to return someday.

Sonic Rush was developed by Sonic Team and Dimps, and published by Sega. Yuji Naka, Sega's executive managing director, announced the game at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, along with Project Rub. A demo of the newly titled Sonic Rush was featured at E3 2005, and won video game publication IGN's "Biggest Surprise" award. Blaze the Cat, a new character, was revealed at Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2005. The game's 2.5D format was based on Sonic Team's idea to combine elements from 2D and 3D games in the series. Director Akinori Nishiyama stated in a September 2005 interview with GameSpot that Sonic Team "wanted to keep the elements from 2D, yet still explore some of the new elements from 3D." At TGS 2005, he stated that while working on Sonic Advance 3, he realized that the series was becoming more complicated, opting for a "fast, dynamic action" approach to the next title in the series.

Sonic Rush introduced Blaze, who has become a recurring character in the series. Blaze appeared for the second time in Sonic the Hedgehog in 2006, and then in Sonic Rush Adventure, the sequel to Sonic Rush, and numerous other games.


== Reception ==
Sonic Rush was released on November 15, 2005 in North America; November 18 in Europe; and November 23 in Japan. It was the ninth best-selling DS game of December 2006. It sold 360,000 copies in Europe from March 2006 to March 2007. The game received a "Platinum" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.The game was released to "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game for its usage of elements from older Sonic games. GameSpot, IGN, and Nintendo Power compared the game to older games in the series, specifically those on the Sega Genesis. GameSpy staff writer Greg Sewart offered a similar opinion, also praising the game for its "gorgeous graphics". The game's overall quickness was not as well received. GameSpy's Greg Sewart, although giving a mostly positive review, complained that "it's so fast you almost can't tell what's going on most of the time." 1UP.com and GamePro thought similarly. The game's music was well-received, called "bright [and] buoyant" by 1UP.com and compared to that of Jet Set Radio by GameSpot. GameSpy called the music "all very fitting and very catchy", noting its use of sampling and unconventional structure.In 2008, Sonic Rush was listed at #17 in IGN's list of the top 25 DS games. In 2009, it was listed as one of the "cheers" on IGN's "Cheers & Tears" list of action games for the DS.

A New Day (song)

"A New Day" is a non-album single by English post-punk band Killing Joke. It was released by E.G. Records in July 1984 as a 12" and 7" single. The 12" single featured a dub mix of "A New Day" as the A-side and "A New Day" as the B-side. The 7" single featured a shorter version of "A New Day" as the A-side and "Dance Day" as the B-side. A completely different version of "A New Day", which was not a mix, later appeared on the 2008 reissue of Killing Joke's fifth studio album, Night Time. The single reached No. 51 in the UK Singles Chart. A promotional video was filmed for the song, marking the first time the band had made a video for a non-album single.

Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One

Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One is the second studio album by American indie rock band The Olivia Tremor Control, released in 1999 through Flydaddy Records. It was re-released on vinyl in November 2011 through Chunklet.
The album consists of several indie rock songs layered with dense field recordings and noise manipulation, as well as several tracks that are just noise collages, ranging in length from four seconds to over eleven minutes. There are five Black Foliage: Animation songs, which all feature the same bass line, but contain heavy sonic experimentation and go in vastly different directions. According to band member Will Cullen Hart, the Animation tracks are intended to evoke imagery of animations. In the liner notes of their debut album Music from the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle, The Olivia Tremor Control asked their fans to send in tape recordings describing dreams they had, which are sampled in the album, most notably in "Combinations 2" and "Hilltop Procession (Momentum Gaining)".
Black Foliage was recorded and mixed entirely on 4 and 8 track tape recorders. According to the liner notes, the band collaborated with many fellow members of The Elephant 6 Recording Company collective, including Neutral Milk Hotel frontman Jeff Mangum, who sings backup vocals in the song "I Have Been Floated".

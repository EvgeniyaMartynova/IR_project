Iceberg B-15

Iceberg B-15 was the world's largest recorded iceberg. It measured around 295 kilometres (183 mi) long and 37 kilometres (23 mi) wide, with a surface area of 11,000 square kilometres (4,200 sq mi)—larger than the whole island of Jamaica. Calved from the Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica in March 2000, Iceberg B-15 broke up into smaller icebergs, the largest of which was named Iceberg B-15A. In 2003, B-15A drifted away from Ross Island into the Ross Sea and headed north, eventually breaking up into several smaller icebergs in October 2005. As of 2018, a large piece of the original iceberg was steadily moving northward, located between the Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.


== History ==

In the last weeks of March 2000, Iceberg B-15 calved from the Ross Ice Shelf near Roosevelt Island, Antarctica. The calving occurred along pre-existing cracks in the ice shelf. The iceberg measured around 295 kilometres (183 mi) long and 37 kilometres (23 mi) wide, with a surface area of 10,915 square kilometres (4,214 sq mi)—nearly as large as the island of Jamaica,(10,991 square kilometres (4,244 sq mi)). Scientists believe that the enormous piece of ice broke away as part of a long-term natural cycle, which occurs every fifty to one hundred years. In 2000, 2002, and 2003, Iceberg B-15 broke up into several pieces, the largest of which, B-15A, covered 6,400 square kilometres (2,500 sq mi) of the sea surface.In November 2003, after the separation from B-15J, B-15A drifted away from Ross Island on the open waters of the Ross Sea. In December 2003, a small knife-shaped iceberg, B-15K (about 300 km²), detached itself from the main body of B-15A and started drifting northward. By January 2005, prevailing currents caused B-15A to drift toward the Drygalski Ice Tongue, a 70-kilometre (43 mi) long extension of the land-based David Glacier, which flows through the coastal mountains of Victoria Land. A few kilometres from the ice tongue, the iceberg became stranded on a shallow seamount before resuming its northward course. On 10 April 2005, B-15A collided with the ice tongue, breaking off the tip of the ice tongue; the iceberg seemed unaffected by the collision.Iceberg B-15A continued to drift along the coast leaving McMurdo Sound. On 27–28 October 2005, the iceberg ran aground off Cape Adare in Victoria Land and broke into several smaller pieces, generating seismic signals that were detected as far away as the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station  the largest of which was still named B-15A (now measuring approximately 1,700 square kilometres (660 sq mi)). Three additional pieces were named B-15P, B-15M, and B-15N. Iceberg B-15A then moved farther up north and broke up into more pieces. These were spotted by air force fisheries patrol on 3 November 2006. On 21 November 2006 several large pieces were seen just 60 km off the coast of Timaru, New Zealand—the largest measured about 18 kilometres (11 mi), rising 37 metres (121 ft) from the surface of the ocean.
As of 2018, four pieces remain that are large enough to be tracked by the National Ice Center (at least 20 square nautical miles). One piece, B-15Z, measures 10 nautical miles by 5 nautical miles. It was located in the southern Atlantic ocean, about 150 nautical miles northwest of South Georgia Island. As it continues its move northward, the speed of melt increases. Most icebergs do not last long this far north.


== Effect on Antarctic ecology ==

On 29 January 2001, researchers from the University of Chicago and the University of Wisconsin installed weather and Global Positioning System instruments on Iceberg B-15A. It was the first time an iceberg had been monitored in this way. The data gathered led to an unprecedented understanding of how giant icebergs make their way through the waters of Antarctica and beyond.
Iceberg B-15A collided with the Drygalski Ice Tongue on 10 April 2005, breaking off an 8-square-kilometre (3.1 sq mi) section of the ice tongue. Antarctic maps needed to be redrawn.
B-15A prevented ocean currents and winds from assisting in the 2004–2005 summer break-up of the sea ice in McMurdo Sound, and was an obstacle to the annual resupply ships to three research stations. The floe was expected to cause a catastrophic decline in the population of Adélie penguins, as it added considerable distances which parent penguins must travel back from the sea to their chicks. Weddell seals and Skuas are also inhabitants of McMurdo Sound and their populations may have been affected as well.
In October 2006, a study showed that a large storm in the Gulf of Alaska generated a trans-Pacific ocean swell that may have contributed to breaking B15-A into many pieces on 27 October 2005. The swell travelled 13,500 kilometres (8,400 mi) from Alaska to Antarctica over six days. Scientists are studying this event as an example of how weather in one area can have effects in other parts of the world, and with concern over the effects on global warming.A more detailed study in 2010, however, shows that the iceberg breakup was principally caused by repeated grounding with near-coastal bathymetry near Cape Adare, Victoria Land.

Caro–Kann Defence

The Caro–Kann Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

1. e4 c6The Caro–Kann is a common defence against the King's Pawn Opening and is classified as a "Semi-Open Game" like the Sicilian Defence and French Defence, although it is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than either of those openings. It often leads to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure. 

  
   


== History ==

The opening is named after the English player Horatio Caro and the Austrian player Marcus Kann who analysed it in 1886. Kann scored an impressive 17-move victory with the Caro–Kann Defence against German-British chess champion Jacques Mieses at the 4th German Chess Congress in Hamburg in May 1885:

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 4.Bd3 Bxd3 5.Qxd3 e6 6.f4 c5 7.c3 Nc6 8.Nf3 Qb6 9.0-0 Nh6 10.b3 cxd4 11.cxd4 Nf5 12.Bb2 Rc8 13.a3 Ncxd4 14.Nxd4 Bc5 15.Rd1 Nxd4 16.Bxd4 Bxd4+ 17.Qxd4 Rc1 0–1


== Main line: 2.d4 d5 ==
After 2.d4 d5 the most common moves are 3.Nc3 (Classical and Modern variations), 3.Nd2 (usually transposing into 3.Nc3), 3.exd5 (Exchange Variation), and 3.e5 (Advance Variation).


=== 3.Nc3 and 3.Nd2 ===
3.Nc3 and 3.Nd2 usually transpose into each other after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4. Since the 1970s, 3.Nd2 has increased in popularity to avoid the Gurgenidze Variation (3.Nc3 g6); however, some players choose to allow it.


==== Classical Variation: 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 ====

The most common way of handling the Caro–Kann, the Classical Variation (often referred to as the Capablanca Variation after Cuban grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca), is defined by the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 (or 3.Nd2) dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5. This was long considered to represent best play for both sides in the Caro–Kann. White usually continues: 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nd7 8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3. Although White's pawn on h5 looks ready to attack, it can prove to be a weakness in an endgame.Much of the Caro–Kann's reputation as a solid defence stems from this variation. Black makes very few compromises in pawn structure and plays a timely ...c6–c5 to contest the d4-square. Variations with Black castling queenside gave the Caro–Kann its reputation of being solid but somewhat boring. More popular recently are variations with Black castling kingside and even leaving his king in the centre. These variations can be sharp and dynamic.
Here is a brilliancy illustrating White's attacking chances when the players castle on opposite sides in the Classical Variation:

Lev Milman vs. Joseph Fang, Foxwoods Open 2005 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 (10...Qc7 avoids White's next) 11. Bf4 Bb4+ 12. c3 Be7 13. 0-0-0 Ngf6 14. Kb1 0-0 15. Ne5 c5?! (15...Qa5 is usual and better) 16. Qf3 Qb6? (necessary was 16...cxd4 17.Rxd4 Nxe5 18.Bxe5 Qc8 19.Rhd1 Rd8 20.Ne4 with a small White advantage) 17. Nxd7 Nxd7 18. d5 exd5 19. Nf5! Bf6 20. Rxd5 Qe6 21. Bxh6 Ne5 (21...gxh6 22.Rd6 Qe8 23.Rxf6 Nxf6 24.Qg3+ mates on g7) 22. Qe4 Nc6 23. Qf3 Ne5? (23...gxh6 24.Rd6 Qe5 25.Nxh6+ Kg7 26.Nf5+ Kh7 with an unclear position) 24. Qe4 Nc6 25. Qg4! Qxd5 (25...Ne5 26.Rxe5 Qxe5 27.Bxg7 Bxg7 28.h6 wins) 26. Bxg7 Qd3+ 27. Ka1 Ne5 28. Ne7+!! Kh7 29. Qg6+!! fxg6 30. hxg6+ Kxg7 31. Rh7# (White is down a queen, a rook, and a bishop!)


==== Modern Variation: 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7 ====

Another solid positional line, this variation is characterised by the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 (or 3.Nd2) dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7. At one time named after the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, nowadays the  variation is variously referred to as the Smyslov Variation after the seventh world champion Vasily Smyslov who played a number of notable games with it, the Karpov Variation, after the twelfth world champion Anatoly Karpov, in whose repertoire it appeared quite often, or, most commonly, the Modern Variation. The short-term goal of 4...Nd7 is to ease development by the early exchange of a pair of knights without compromising the structural integrity of Black's position. Play is similar to the Classical Variation except that Black has more freedom by delaying the development of his bishop, and is not forced to play it to the g6-square. However, this freedom comes at a cost as White enjoys added freedom in taking up space in the centre, and often plays the aggressive 5.Ng5!? where Black's development is brought into question as well as the positional weakness of the f7-square. The famous last game of the Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov rematch where Kasparov committed a known blunder and lost was played in this very line.
Specialist knowledge is a must to play this opening. Otherwise Black could fall prey to early attacks such as the quick mating trap for White, 5.Qe2 followed by 6.Nd6#.


==== 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+ ====
The Bronstein–Larsen Variation and Korchnoi Variation both begin with the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6!? 5.Nxf6+.


===== Bronstein–Larsen Variation: 5...gxf6 =====

Black has voluntarily opted for an inferior pawn structure and a practical necessity of castling queenside, while gaining dynamic compensation in the form of the open g-file for the rook and unusually active play for the Caro–Kann. It is generally considered somewhat unsound, though world championship challenger David Bronstein and former world championship candidate Bent Larsen employed it with some success.


===== Korchnoi Variation: 5...exf6 =====

Viktor Korchnoi played 5...exf6 many times (including his first world championship match with Anatoly Karpov), and this line has also been employed by Ulf Andersson. Black's 5...exf6 is regarded as sounder than 5...gxf6!? of the Bronstein–Larsen Variation and offers Black rapid development, though also ceding White the superior pawn structure and long-term prospects (Black has to be cautious that the d-pawn is now a potential passed pawn in the endgame).


==== Gurgenidze Variation: 3.Nc3 g6 ====

The Gurgenidze Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 g6. Black prepares to fianchetto the bishop on g7, creating pressure against White's d4-pawn. After 4.Nf3 Bg7 White usually plays 5.h3 to prevent the ...Bg4 pin. This variation, originated by Bukhuti Gurgenidze, led to a rise in the popularity of 3.Nd2 during the 1970s. After 3.Nd2, 3...g6 is met by 4.c3, when the fianchettoed bishop has little to do. 3.Nd2 will usually transpose into the Classical Variation after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4.


=== Advance Variation: 3.e5 ===

The 3...Bf5 variation that follows with 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 has gained popularity after having previously been widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the strategic demolition that Aron Nimzowitsch (playing as White) suffered at the hands of José Capablanca in one of their games at the New York 1927 tournament.The Advance Variation has since been revitalized by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4), a popular line in the 1980s and later favoured by Latvian grandmaster Alexei Shirov, or the less ambitious variation 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3, popularised by English grandmaster Nigel Short and often seen in the 1990s. Another less popular but aggressive line is the Tal variation (4.h4 h5), popularised by grandmaster Mikhail Tal.

The 3...c5 variation that follows with 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5!? is an important alternative and avoids the weight of theory associated with 3...Bf5. It was used by Mikhail Botvinnik in his 1961 match versus Mikhail Tal (though with a negative outcome for Botvinnik – two draws and a loss). The line was christened the "Arkell/Khenkin Variation" in the leading chess magazine New in Chess yearbook 42 in recognition of the work these two grandmasters did and the success they were having with the variation. In comparison to the French Defence, Black lacks the tempo normally spent on ...e6; however, White can only exploit this by the weakening of his own central bind with 4. dxc5 when Black has good chances of regaining the pawn.


=== Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 cxd5 ===
The Exchange Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5.


==== Main line: 4.Bd3 ====

The "true" Exchange Variation begins with 4.Bd3 (to prevent ...Bf5 while still developing) 4...Nc6 5.c3 Nf6 6.Bf4 Bg4 7.Qb3. This line is considered to offer equal chances, and was tried by Bobby Fischer. Some of the strategic ideas are analogous to the Queen's Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation, (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5) with colours reversed.


==== Panov–Botvinnik Attack: 4.c4 ====

The Panov–Botvinnik Attack begins with the move 4.c4. It is named after Vasily Panov and the world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. This system often leads to typical isolated queen's pawn (IQP) positions, with White obtaining rapid development, a grip on e5, and kingside attacking chances to compensate for the long-term structural weakness of the isolated d4-pawn. The major variation in this line is 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nf3, when Black's main alternatives are 6...Bb4 (a position often transposing into lines of the Nimzo-Indian Defence) and 6...Be7, once the most common line. 6...Nc6?! is inferior as it is favourably met by 7.c5!, after which White plans on seizing the e5-square by advancing the  b-pawn to b5, or by exchanging the black knight on c6 after Bb5.


=== Tartakower or Fantasy Variation: 3.f3 ===
The Tartakower or Fantasy Variation, 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.f3, somewhat resembles the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit. 3...e6 is probably the most solid response, preparing to exploit the dark squares via ...c5, though 3....g6 has been tried by Yasser Seirawan. GM Lars Schandorff and GM Sam Shankland both prefer 3...dxe4 4.fxe4 e5 5.Nf3 Bg4 6.Bc4 Nd7 7.0-0 Ngf6 8.c3 Bd6 with play being sharp and double-edged. Interesting, though probably insufficient is 3...e5. This so-called 'Twisted Fantasy Variation' aims to exploit White's weaknesses on the a7–g1 diagonal, an idea similar to 3...Qb6, a variation championed by Baadur Jobava. Related to the Fantasy Variation are the gambits 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3, originated by Sir Stuart Milner-Barry, and 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.f3  (von Hennig).


== Two Knights Variation: 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) ==

The Two Knights Variation 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) was played by Bobby Fischer in his youth, but has since declined in popularity. White's intention is to benefit from rapid development as well as to retain options regarding the d-pawn. Black's logical and probably best reply is 3...Bg4. After 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3, the positional continuation, Black has the option of 5...Nf6 or 5...e6. The Retreat Line 4...Bh5 is playable but Black must be careful. In  Noteboom–Mindeno 1927 Black lost quickly after 5.exd5 cxd5 6.g4 Bg6 7.Ne5 a6? (7...Nc6 is necessary) 8.h4 d4 9.h5! dxc3 10.hxg6 cxd2+ 11.Qxd2 Qxd2+ 12.Bxd2 and Black must lose material.This variation sets a trap: if Black plays along the lines of the Classical Variation, he gets in trouble after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 (4...Nd7 is playable) 5.Ng3 Bg6?! (5...Bg4) 6.h4 h6 7.Ne5 Bh7 (7...Qd6 may be best) 8.Qh5! g6 (forced) 9.Bc4! e6 (9...gxh5?? 10.Bxf7#) 10.Qe2 with a huge advantage for White. Now 10...Qe7! is best. Instead, Lasker–Radsheer, 1908 and Alekhine–Bruce, 1938 ended quickly after, respectively, 10...Bg7?? 11.Nxf7! and 10...Nf6?? 11.Nxf7!

After the moves 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Qf3!?, White's position is sound according to Graham Burgess.


== Other lines ==
2.c4, the Accelerated Panov Attack, is an effective move for White. Black will probably play 2...d5 (see 1.e4 c6 2.c4 d5). This can transpose to the Panov–Botvinnik (B14, given above, with 3.exd5 cxd5 4.d4) or Caro–Kann (B10, with the double capture on d5). Alternatively, Black may play 2...e5, the Open Variation (see 1.e4 c6 2.c4 e5). The 2.c4 line can also arise by transposition from the English Opening: 1.c4 c6 2.e4.
The Hillbilly Attack, 1.e4 c6 2.Bc4?!, is most often played by weaker players unfamiliar with the Caro–Kann Defence. If 2...d5 3. exd5 cxd5, Black has simply gained a tempo on the bishop. Nevertheless, GM Simon Williams has experimented with this move, following it up by gambiting the pawn with 2...d5 3.Bb3!?Other lines are ineffective or doubtful. These include 2.d3, the Breyer Variation; 2.b3, the Euwe Attack; 2.b4, the Labahn Attack; and 2.g4, the Spike Variation.

Brandon Marshall

Brandon Tyrone Marshall (born March 23, 1984) is an American football wide receiver who is currently a free agent. He played college football at UCF, and was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. Marshall has also played for the Miami Dolphins, Chicago Bears, New York Jets, New York Giants, and the Seattle Seahawks. He was signed by the New Orleans Saints as a free agent on November 12, 2018, but was later released that season on December 12, 2018 without appearing in a single game for the Saints.
Marshall is known for his ability to break and dodge tackles. He led all NFL wide receivers in yards after first contact for the 2007 NFL season. Regarding Marshall's breakaway ability, cornerback Brandon Flowers said, "Brandon Marshall is a defensive lineman playing wide receiver. He wants to inflict punishment on you. He wants you to try to tackle him so he can shove you off of him and get more yards." Cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha said Marshall is "the toughest guy to bring down, one-on-one."  Despite Marshall's long productive career, he has never played in a playoff game.  His 12,351 career receiving yards are the most ever by a receiver who has never played in the postseason.On December 13, 2009, against the Indianapolis Colts, Marshall set an NFL record for receptions in a game with 21. He also is one of six players in NFL history to catch at least 100 passes in three consecutive seasons.


== Early years ==
Marshall was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and later lived in Georgia and Florida where he played high school football at Lake Howell High School.Marshall was a letterman in basketball and track three times at Lake Howell. He played both offense and defense, as he earned All-State honors and was named Seminole County Utility Player of the Year. In track Marshall competed as a jumper. As a senior, he won the Class 3A state triple jump championship, landing a personal-best jump of 14.81 meters, and also placed ninth in long jump, recording a jump of 6.88 meters. As a top competitor in high jump, he cleared 1.98 meters at the 2002 FHSAA 3A District 7 Meet, placing second. Marshall was a scholar athlete at the University of Central Florida, and was selected to the All-C-USA Team.


== College career ==
Marshall attended the University of Central Florida, where he played a total of 44 games (21 starts) at wide receiver for the UCF Knights football team. He collected 112 receptions, 1,674 receiving yards, and 13 touchdowns in his collegiate career. As a freshman, he had a limited role and had two receptions for 18 yards and a touchdown. As a sophomore, he had 27 receptions for 363 yards and two touchdowns. As a junior, he had eight receptions for 84 yards and had an interception on defense. His best season came in 2005 as a senior. He played in 13 games and had career highs in receptions (74), receiving yards (1,195), and touchdowns (11). Marshall's best career game came in the 2005 Hawaii Bowl, where he had 11 catches for 210 yards and three touchdowns. He was named MVP of the game. For his efforts during the 2005 season, Marshall was selected to the All-C-USA second team.Marshall also started at safety for seven games during the 2004 season due to injuries in UCF's secondary. He made his first collegiate start at safety on October 4, 2004, against Buffalo. He recorded four tackles, including half a sack. Marshall led his entire team in tackles (51) during the 2004 season.


=== Collegiate statistics ===


== Professional career ==


=== Denver Broncos ===
The Denver Broncos selected Marshall with the 119th overall selection in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL Draft.


==== 2006 season ====

Before the regular season began, Marshall suffered a slight tear to his posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in the preseason game against the Detroit Lions. Although the injury sidelined him for a couple weeks, he was able to return and play in 15 games (1 start) during the regular season. Marshall had a total of 20 catches, 309 receiving yards, and 2 touchdowns for his rookie year. On October 22, against the Cleveland Browns, he had his first professional receiving touchdown. He caught a pass in each of the Broncos' final seven games of the season, totaling 18 receptions, 287 receiving yards, and 1 touchdown over that stretch. The lone touchdown came during an NBC Sunday Night Football home game against the Seattle Seahawks on December 3, 2006. In that game, Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler (who was making his NFL regular season debut as a rookie) threw a pass to Marshall on the right side of the field. Marshall broke and spun away from three tackles on his way to a career-long 71-yard touchdown. It was the second longest rookie-to-rookie pass play in Broncos history.


==== 2007 season ====

Marshall sustained injuries before the start of the 2007 season. He suffered a groin strain that kept him out of Broncos quarterback camp and team camp during May and June. He also pulled a quadriceps femoris muscle on July 10, 2007, during Broncos mini-camp. The injury left him out for nearly all of training camp until Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan ordered him to participate for the last couple of days.On December 13, 2007, in a Thursday night road loss against the Houston Texans, Marshall caught 11 passes for 107 yards. Nine of those receptions occurred in the first half. Marshall became the only wide receiver in Broncos history to have at least 10 receptions in two consecutive games. On Christmas Eve, 2007, in a Monday night road loss to the San Diego Chargers, Marshall caught six passes for 75 yards. On December 30, 2007, in a home win against the Minnesota Vikings, Marshall caught 10 passes for 114 yards and a touchdown. The 10 catches gave Marshall 102 total receptions for the year – his first career 100-catch season. He became only the third second-year player in NFL history to have at least 100 receptions in a season, joining Isaac Bruce and Larry Fitzgerald.During the 2007 season, Marshall posted team-highs and career-highs in receptions (102), receiving yards (1,325) and receiving touchdowns (7). Marshall reached the 1,000-yard milestone during the 13th game of the season, which was a 41–7 home win over the Kansas City Chiefs. In the game, Marshall had 10 catches for 115 yards and 2 touchdowns. Among all of the wide receivers in the NFL during the season, Marshall placed fifth in receptions (102), sixth in receiving yards (1,325), second in yards after the catch (505), first in yards after first contact (319), first in number of times targeted (170) and tied for fourth in catches that led to first downs (70).Following the 2007 season, Marshall, Cutler, and Tony Scheffler went to Atlanta, Georgia together to train and work on timing for the 2008 season.


==== 2008 season ====


===== Non-football injury =====
On March 22, 2008, Marshall slipped on an empty McDonald's bag while wrestling with family members, and subsequently, fell through a television set at his home in Orlando, Florida – cutting his right forearm. According to Broncos head athletic trainer Steve Antonopulos, Marshall "sustained right forearm lacerations to one artery, one vein, one nerve, two tendons and three muscles." He was treated at a local hospital and later released after needing a cast and several stitches. In early April, Marshall had the cast removed from his surgically repaired right forearm and was in a sling until May. He was cleared in late-June to practice with the Broncos. He later revealed that his right hand was numb during the entire 2008 season.


===== Suspension =====
Marshall officially received a three-game suspension from the NFL on August 5, 2008, due to off-the-field legal troubles including a drunk driving charge and domestic violence arrest. He appealed the decision and won the appeal, reducing the punishment to a one-game suspension and a fine of two combined game checks, which totaled $52,353.


===== Bronco and NFL records =====
In Marshall's first game back from suspension, he caught 18 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown, in a 39–38 home victory over the San Diego Chargers. The 18 receptions were a Broncos single-game record, and tied for the second most in NFL history, trailing only Terrell Owens, who caught 20 passes for the San Francisco 49ers in a game during the 2000 NFL season. Marshall's 18 receptions gave him 55 total receptions over five games, which is an NFL record. He is the first receiver in NFL history to register at least 10 receptions in four out of five games. His performance against the Chargers also earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career.


====== Attempted celebration ======
Marshall received attention for an attempted touchdown celebration during the Broncos' 34–30 comeback road victory over the Cleveland Browns in a Thursday Night Football matchup on November 6, 2008. With over a minute left in the game, Marshall caught the go-ahead touchdown pass and then began to pull a glove from his pants. Denver wide receiver Brandon Stokley rushed over to Marshall to urge him to put the glove away, as it could be considered a touchdown celebration prop, which is against NFL rules (a 15-yard penalty on the kickoff could be assessed). Marshall later explained that he was intending to put on the glove (which was white with one half of it painted black) as a means to honor racial progress and unity in the United States, following the country electing Barack Obama as President two days earlier. Regarding the attempted touchdown celebration, Marshall said, "I know at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised that black glove and that fist as a silent gesture of black power and liberation. Forty years later, I wanted to make my own statement. I wanted to make my own statement and gesture to represent the progress we made." Smith and Carlos didn't initially see Marshall's attempted gesture when it happened live, but both said they appreciated and understood Marshall's intent. "He wanted to make a mark in history and feel that he was a part of the change for the better," Smith said. "He had the right idea in terms of what he was attempting to do," Carlos said.


===== Place in NFL rankings =====
On December 7, 2008, in the 13th game of the season, Marshall caught 11 passes for 91 yards and two touchdowns, as part of a 24–17 home victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. The 91 yards gave him over 1,000 receiving yards for the second consecutive season. Marshall had his second career multi-touchdown game as well; the first also occurred in a home victory over the Chiefs in the 13th game of the prior season. That game was also where Marshall eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards for a season for the first time in his career.Marshall finished the season ranked third among NFL wide receivers in receptions (104), seventh in receiving yards (1,265), fifth in receiving yards per game (84.3), seventh in yards after the catch (419), third in catches that led to first downs (65) and first in number of times targeted for the second consecutive season (181). The 104 catches were a career-high for Marshall and also made him only the ninth player in NFL history (second Broncos player) to have at least 100 receptions in back-to-back seasons. He finished first in fan voting for AFC wide receivers in the 2009 Pro Bowl. He received 18 more votes than Randy Moss to earn the top spot. Four wide receivers are chosen to play in the game. Fan voting accounts for one-third of the total voting (players and coaches account for the other two-thirds). He was officially picked to play in his first Pro Bowl when selections were announced on December 16, 2008. Marshall was chosen as a starter.


==== 2009 season ====

Marshall had hip surgery on March 31, 2009, to repair an aggravated hip that bothered him during the 2008 season. He returned in time for training camp in late-July; however, he didn't always fully commit to practicing. This led the Broncos to suspend him for the last two games of the preseason (he didn't play in the first two preseason contests) for conduct detrimental to the team.In a 26–6 Thanksgiving home victory over the New York Giants, Marshall recorded six catches (including two one-handed grabs) for 86 yards. His performance earned him the Pudding Pie Award, which is given to the game's MVP by the NFL Network.
On December 13, 2009, Marshall broke Terrell Owens' record for receptions in a game with 21, as part of a 28–16 road loss to the Indianapolis Colts. Owens said, "No more deserving of a guy than he is. He's just been a hard worker....I wish him well. He's going to have a great career." Marshall became the first player since 1960 to record eight career games of at least 10 catches in his first four seasons. During the game against the Colts, he also had two touchdowns and a career-high 200 receiving yards. Marshall's performance earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for the second time in his career.On December 27, 2009, in a 30–27 road loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Marshall caught his 100th pass of the season. He became only the fifth player in NFL history (first Broncos player) to do so in three consecutive seasons (previously Jerry Rice, Herman Moore, Marvin Harrison, concurrently Wes Welker, and subsequently Antonio Brown). Marshall was named to his second consecutive Pro Bowl when rosters were announced on December 29.Marshall was benched for the team's final regular season game by head coach Josh McDaniels for failing to arrive at a physical therapy session on time. The Broncos lost the regular season finale in Denver, 44–24, to the Kansas City Chiefs on January 3, 2010. They missed the playoffs for the fourth straight year. Marshall ended the season tied for third among NFL wide receivers in catches (101), tied for seventh in receiving touchdowns (10), seventh in yards after the catch (527), and fifth in number of times targeted (154).


=== Miami Dolphins ===


==== 2010 season ====

On April 14, 2010, Marshall was traded from the Denver Broncos to the Miami Dolphins for a second round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft and a second round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft. On the same day, the Dolphins and Marshall agreed to a four-year, $47.5 million extension.Marshall finished the season with 86 receptions for 1,014 yards and three touchdowns. His streak of three straight years with 100 or more receptions came to an end, but he did extend his streak of 1,000 receiving yards to four straight years.

=== Chicago Bears ===


==== 2012 season ====

Marshall was traded to the Chicago Bears on March 13, 2012, for one third round draft pick in 2012 and a future one in 2013, reuniting him with former Bronco teammate Jay Cutler leading to a career year for Marshall. In his Bears debut against the Indianapolis Colts, Marshall caught 9 passes for 119 yards, which was the twentieth time he surpassed one hundred yards in his career. He also caught a 3-yard touchdown pass, as the Bears would go on to win 41–21. After the Bears win over the Detroit Lions in Week 7, Marshall was fined $10,500 for wearing orange cleats. In Week 12 against the Minnesota Vikings, Marshall recorded 12 catches for 92 yards, and passed the 1,000 yards receiving mark in a season for the sixth time in his career, making Marshall the first Bears receiver to accomplish the feat since Marty Booker in 2002. Two weeks later against the Vikings, Marshall recorded ten catches for 160 yards, passing Booker's single season reception mark with a total of 101 receptions. In Week 16 against the Arizona Cardinals, Marshall broke Marcus Robinson's single-season franchise record for receiving yards set in 1999.

However, Marshall did not play in the game due to having an arthroscopic procedure on his hip, and was replaced by Larry Fitzgerald. Marshall finished the season with 118 receptions, 89 catches more than the next Bears receiver Earl Bennett, tying the New England Patriots receiver Wes Welker for second, behind Detroit Lions' Calvin Johnson, and third in receiving yards with 1,508, behind Houston's Andre Johnson.


==== 2013 season ====

Marshall opened the 2013 season strong, by catching the game-winning touchdown pass against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 1. In Week 6 against the New York Giants, Marshall stated he will wear green cleats to support his mental illness foundation and promote Mental Health Awareness Week; Marshall was expected to be fined, so he additionally said, "I'm going to get fined, and I'm going to match that, and we want to partner with a cancer-care [charity]." Marshall was eventually fined $10,500 by the league. In Week 17, Brandon Marshall torched the Green Bay Packers by providing an early 4th quarter touchdown from quarterback Jay Cutler. Despite the effort, Marshall and the Bears lost the game, coming up short and missing the playoffs with a record of 8-8. Marshall ended 2013 with 100 receptions for 1,295 yards and a career-high 12 touchdown receptions, which is the third-highest in franchise history, behind Ken Kavanaugh and Dick Gordon's 13 in 1947 and 1970, respectively, and the most by a Bears player since Curtis Conway's 12 in 1995. It was also Marshall's fifth season with 100 or more receptions, which tied him with Wes Welker and Andre Johnson for the most in league history. Also, Marshall is the first player in Bears history to record multiple 100-reception seasons.

In Week 3, Marshall surpassed the 10,000 receiving yards mark in his career.

He was named to his sixth Pro Bowl and was ranked 25th by his fellow on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.


==== 2016 season ====

According to Orlando-Orange County public records (case 48-2004-MM-012392-O), on Halloween 2004, while a student at UCF, Marshall was arrested in Orlando on charges of assault on a law enforcement officer, refusal to obey, disorderly conduct, and resisting an officer.On January 1, 2007, Marshall was present at The Shelter, a nightclub in Denver, Colorado, along with teammates Javon Walker and Darrent Williams. The trio was attending a birthday party held for and by Denver Nuggets forward Kenyon Martin. As the players were leaving the club in a limousine, Williams was fatally shot in the neck after an unknown assailant opened fire on the vehicle. Willie Clark was later charged with the murder. Walker has stated in interviews that the shooter was likely a nightclub patron whose motive was retaliation after being involved in an altercation with Marshall's cousin earlier that night.On March 26, 2007, Marshall was arrested in the Highlands Ranch suburb of Denver on suspicion of domestic violence after his girlfriend reported that following a domestic dispute, Marshall prevented a taxi she was in from leaving his house. Charges from the incident were later dismissed on May 25, 2007, after Marshall completed anger management counseling.In the early morning of October 22, 2007, Marshall was arrested in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area at the intersection of 14th and Blake St. for driving under the influence of alcohol. A trial was scheduled for September 16, but Marshall instead agreed to a plea bargain four days earlier; he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of driving while ability impaired. He was sentenced to one-year probation and 24 hours of community service.
On June 12, 2008, Marshall was ticketed for an illegal lane change, then found to be without his license and proof of insurance. The case was eventually dropped as part of a plea bargain for the October 22, 2007 driving incident involving alcohol.A September 17, 2008 article on CompleteColorado.com stated that the solicitor's office in Fulton County, Georgia filed misdemeanor battery charges on September 10 for an alleged incident on March 4, 2008, in Atlanta, Georgia. Marshall was booked on March 6, then released the next day after posting a $1,000 cash bond. The case was assigned to Judge John Mather in Georgia state court. On August 14, 2009, a jury in Atlanta found Marshall not guilty.On March 1, 2009, Marshall was arrested in Atlanta for disorderly conduct after allegedly being involved in a fight with his fiancée, Michi Nogami-Campbell. Marshall was released on a $300 bond. The charges were dropped the following day.On April 23, 2011, Marshall was stabbed near his stomach by his wife, Michi Nogami-Marshall. He was taken to a hospital and was released two days later. He has since made a full recovery.It was later revealed by police that Marshall's wife did make a brief 911 call, but it only described an unspecified emergency and no mention of a stabbing ever took place. She was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and is free on $7,500 bail.
On early Sunday, March 11, 2012, two days before his trade to the Bears, Marshall was accused of hitting a woman in the face at a New York club and being involved in a melee. The New York Post stated that Marshall, his wife and some friends were at Marquee when a brawl ensued, and Marshall punched the woman below her left eye, although he may have been attempting to hit the woman's friends. The investigation later ended after a lack of evidence of Marshall's role in the incident.

B15 (New York City bus)

The Sumner Avenue Line and New Lots Avenue Line were two streetcar lines in Brooklyn, New York City, running mainly along Marcus Garvey Boulevard (formerly Sumner Avenue), East 98th Street, and New Lots Avenue between northern Bedford–Stuyvesant and New Lots. Originally streetcar lines, the two lines were combined as a bus route in 1947. That bus route became the present B15 Marcus Garvey Boulevard / New Lots Avenue service, operated by MTA New York City Bus' East New York Depot in East New York. The B15 continues east from New Lots to John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens.


== Route description ==
The B15 bus route runs between the Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center and Flushing Avenue (J and ​M) subway station in Bedford–Stuyvesant, and John F. Kennedy International Airport's Terminal 5 in Queens. Alternate buses during rush hours and weekends short turn at Drew Street/Elderts Lane on Linden Boulevard in Spring Creek, at the border with Lindenwood, Queens.The B15 bus route heads south through Bedford–Stuyvesant along Marcus Garvey Boulevard (southbound) and Lewis Avenue (northbound). After crossing Fulton Street, buses use a number of streets through Crown Heights and Ocean Hill, eventually turning south on Ralph Avenue and southeast on East 98th Street. In Brownsville and East New York, buses head east on Hegeman Avenue and New Lots Avenue, then south to Linden Boulevard and merging onto Conduit Avenue after entering Queens. B15 buses then serve several areas of JFK Airport and end at Terminal 5. Between the Brooklyn-Queens border and JFK Airport, B15 buses run non-stop.Between the 1990s and September 2013, the short-turn B15 Spring Creek terminus was a separate branch, directly serving the Brooklyn General Mail Facility via a turnaround loop at the north end of the facility south of Linden Boulevard. The JFK and Postal Facility branches were combined during midday and overnight hours. The loop is still served by terminating B14 and B20 buses, and through B13 service to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Bushwick or the Gateway Center in the southern portion of Spring Creek.Originally named after abolitionist Charles Sumner, Sumner Avenue was renamed Marcus Garvey Avenue in 1987, and later Marcus Garvey Boulevard after Pan-Africanism proponent Marcus Garvey.


== History ==


=== Sumner Avenue Line ===
The Yates Avenue and Flatbush Railroad was organized in 1881 to build a branch of the Broadway Railroad, beginning at Broadway and Yates Avenue (present-day Marcus Garvey Boulevard) in Bedford–Stuyvesant, continuing south on Yates to Fulton Street, then east on Fulton, where it ran over the Brooklyn City Rail Road's Fulton Street Line to Troy Avenue, and continued south on Troy to end at Bergen Street. The Broadway Railroad leased the line on December 31, 1881. The Brooklyn, Queens County and Suburban Railroad, owned by the Long Island Traction Company (later the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company or BRT), leased the Broadway Railroad in early 1894, and the line was electrified in late October. After the Nassau Electric Railroad, which owned the Bergen Street Line, was leased to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad (another BRT property) in 1899, Sumner Avenue cars were extended south/east along the Bergen Street, Saint Johns Place, and Ralph Avenue lines to Brownsville and west along the Bergen Street Line to Hamilton Ferry in Red Hook. The BRT would become the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) in 1923.


=== Conversion to bus service ===
Beginning in the 1920s many streetcar lines in Brooklyn and the rest of the city began to be replaced by buses, particularly after the unification of the city's three primary transit companies (including the BMT) under municipal operations in June 1940. The New Lots Avenue Line was converted to buses in mid-1941, running from the Canarsie Depot at Rockaway Avenue and Hegeman Avenue continuing east along Hegeman Avenue and Linden Boulevard to Atkins Avenue/Berriman Street in East New York. The service was assigned the B10 designation. On July 8, 1947, the B10 was extended to replace Sumner Avenue trolley service. The Sumner route was cut back from Williamsburg Bridge Plaza to its current terminal at Broadway and Sumner Avenue with direct Bedford–Stuyvesant-Red Hook service unreplaced. Sumner trolley service was fully eliminated in 1949.On September 29, 1963, several Brooklyn streets including Sumner Avenue were turned into one-way streets; Sumner Avenue would become southbound only. Northbound B10 buses were rerouted onto Lewis Avenue at this time. By this time, the B10 had been extended east along Linden Boulevard to Drew Street/Elderts Lane in New Lots/Spring Creek, near the Brooklyn-Queens border. This extension had been proposed around 1960 to serve the Cypress Hills and Louis Heaton Pink public housing complexes in New Lots. The bus would serve Brooklyn General Mail Facility in Spring Creek when it opened in 1991. In 1993, the route was extended to its current terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport's Terminal 4 in Jamaica, Queens.  When the route was extended to Kennedy Airport it was redesignated as the B15 (the previous designation for a route between City Hall and Downtown Brooklyn) to avoid confusion with the Q10, an existing route serving the airport, at the time operated by Green Bus Lines (now part of MTA Bus Company).
On April 11, 2004, 24-hour service was added to the B15 between Brooklyn and JFK Airport. At the same time, service to all JFK terminals except Terminal 4 was replaced by a free transfer to the AirTrain JFK. On October 12, 2009, buses on the B15 were equipped with luggage racks, as part of a ten-bus pilot program on airport bus services to improve passenger flow. On May 30, 2012, due to construction at Terminal 4, the B15 started terminating at a new stop at Terminal 5, near the former Terminal 6. On September 8, 2013, B15 buses stopped directly serving the Brooklyn General Mail Facility loop due to low ridership.

London Buses route B15

This is a list of Transport for London (TfL) contracted bus routes in London, England, as well as commercial services that enter the Greater London area (except coaches). Bus services in London are operated by Abellio London, Arriva London, HCT Group, Go-Ahead London (Blue Triangle, Docklands Buses, London Central, and London General), Metroline, RATP Group (London Sovereign, London United, and Quality Line) Stagecoach London (East London, Selkent, and Thameside), Sullivan Buses, Tower Transit, and Uno. TfL-sponsored operators run more than 500 services.
Non-TfL-sponsored operators including Arriva Shires & Essex, Arriva Southern Counties, Cardinal Buses, Carousel Buses, Go-Coach, First Berkshire & The Thames Valley, Hallmark Bus, Metrobus, Red Rose Travel, Southdown PSV, Stagecoach South, Trustybus, and Uno operate services between parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex on the one hand and London on the other, with one local council-sponsored service each in the boroughs of Bexley, Barking & Dagenham, and Hackney (extending into Islington).


== Classification of route numbers ==
In Victorian times, passengers could only recognise the owner and route of an omnibus (Latin: "for everyone") by its livery and line name, with painted signs on the sides showing the two termini to indicate the route. Then, in 1906, George Samuel Dicks of the London Motor Omnibus Company decided that, as the line name 'Vanguard' had proved to be very popular, he would name all lines 'Vanguard' and number the company's five routes 1 through to 5. Other operators soon saw the advantage, in that a unique route number was easier for the travelling public to remember, and so the practice of using route numbers soon spread.


=== Historic classification ===

Bus routes run by London Transport were grouped as follows.
The London Traffic Act 1924 imposed numbering known as the Bassom Scheme, named after Superintendent (later Chief Constable) Arthur Ernest Bassom of the Metropolitan Police who devised it. For many decades, variant and short workings used letter suffixes (e.g. "77B"). The numbers reflected the company that operated the route.
The numbering was revised in 1934 after London Transport was formed:


=== Current classification ===


== List of routes ==
All routes operate in both directions unless detailed.


=== 1–99 ===


=== 100–199 ===


=== 200–299 ===


=== 300–399 ===


=== 400–499 ===


=== 500–599 ===


=== 600–699 ===


=== 900–999 ===

Route numbers from 900 to 999 represent Mobility Buses; these provide a once-a-week return journey to a local shopping centre from relatively low-density neighbourhoods where there is no alternative route in the main bus network. The number of Mobility Buses routes has declined because low-floor and wheelchair-accessible buses run on all London Buses routes except for the heritage route.


=== Letter prefixes ===


=== Night only routes (N-prefixed) ===

Night bus routes are often related to the day numerical equivalent, normally running the same route but with an extension at either end of the service. This is normally to provide a night service to destinations served by tube or train during the day.However, there are a few N-prefixed route numbers that have no relation to their daytime equivalents: the N5, N20, and N97 all operate in a different part of London to their respective day routes, and the N550 and N551 (which provide night service on parts of the DLR network) have no corresponding daytime routes.There are also 24-hour routes, which run day and night but usually with a lower frequency during the night hours. The vast majority run the same route at all times. With the introduction of the Night Tube, some day routes have been extended to run during Friday and Saturday nights to serve the stations.


== Non-TfL bus routes in Greater London ==
These bus routes are not contracted to TfL and are therefore not 'London Buses'. All but three run from villages and towns outside Greater London to destinations within (the exceptions are the 812, 938, and MB1, which run entirely within the boundary). They are painted in a colour chosen by the operator, so are not necessarily red like London Buses, and most of them do not accept Oyster cards. These routes are operated with a London Service Permit issued by TfL so they are recognised by TfL bus maps and appear on TfL bus stops.


== Temporary routes ==
There are three special TfL express routes which only run during the Notting Hill Carnival: 2X, 36X and 205X.

HLA-B15

HLA-B15 (B15) is an HLA-B serotype. The serotype identifies the B*15 gene-allele protein products of HLA-B.B15 is a broad antigen can be subdivided into several split antigens that are often used in characterization. These are B62, B63, B70, B71, B72, B75, B76, B77. B*15 is the largest allele grouping for any known human autosomal locus, identified as of August 2008 there are more than 150 alleles and ~140 amino acid sequence variants from those gene products. Some of these alleles are discussed below. Other alleles, such as B*46 evolved from B*15. One reason for the diversity of this group is that B15 is among a group of alleles enriched in the original humans that left Africa and dispersed across East Asia and Australia. As people traveled east the frequency of many alleles dropped or disappeared from migrants. However B*15 persisted, expanded and diversified. The wide range and complex environment selected for new alleles and promoted their expansion. B*46 for example is not found in Africa, and appears to have evolved and spread in East Asia, to several 100 million bearers worldwide.
HLA-B15 allele *1502 is associated with the severe skin conditions Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) caused by carbamazepine drug sensitivity in East Asians.

Nissan Sentra

The Nissan Sentra is a car produced by Nissan since 1982. Originally subcompact in classification, for model year 2000 it was reclassified as a compact car. Until 2006, Sentra was a rebadged export version of the Japanese Nissan Sunny, but since the 2013 model year, Sentra is a rebadged export version of the Nissan Sylphy B17. The Sentra nameplate is not used in Japan. Many other countries in South America sell their versions of the Sunny as the Sentra. In Mexico, the first three generations of the Sentra were known as the Nissan Tsuru (Japanese for crane), and the B13 model was sold under that name until 2017, alongside the updated models badged as Sentra.
In North America, the Sentra currently serves as Nissan's compact car, despite being rated as a mid-size car by the EPA due to its interior volume since the 2007 model year. While previous Sentras were subcompacts, the Sentra has grown over the years, with the Nissan Versa having replaced the Sentra in the entry-level area.
The Sentra name was created for Nissan by Ira Bachrach of Namelab, and Bachrach describes the origin as "Nissan wanted consumers to understand that it was quite safe even though it was small. The word Sentra sounds like central as well as sentry, which evokes images of safety."


== B11 (1982–1986) ==

The first generation of the Nissan Sentra was introduced in the United States in May 1982 as a direct replacement for the Datsun 210. Initially the model was imported from Japan, where it was produced at Zama plant. Available in four body styles (two-door sedan, four-door sedan, five-door wagon and three-door hatchback coupe), it was the second car to be marketed in the United States under the nameplate of Nissan and using a model name instead of a number. The first one was the Nissan Stanza, introduced in the 1981 New York Auto Show as a 1982 model. While previous Sunny models had used a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, the B11 Sentra was the first to use a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. Engine choice was the 67 hp (50 kW) (E15) 1.5 L four-cylinder SOHC, replacing the old A-Series OHV. This featured semi-hemispherical combustion chambers, high-swirl intake ports and a semi-dual exhaust manifold to provide strong torque at low and medium rpm ranges. Torque peak was 85 lb⋅ft (115 N⋅m) at 3200 rpm. Transmission options were a four-speed manual, 5-speed manual or a three-speed automatic with lock-up torque converter. Drag coefficient was 0.39 for the coupe and 0.40 for two- and four-door sedans.At the time of its release, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave the Sentra MPG the highest gasoline mileage among gasoline powered cars sold at that time, 43 miles per gallon in city and 58 miles per gallon in highway, a combined 48 miles per gallon. Curb weight of only 1875 pounds helped it to achieve that number. The Sentra MPG was a special configuration that featured a three-way exhaust catalyst and an electronically controlled fuel metering unit to monitor the air-fuel mixture automatically and make adjustments to boost fuel mileage.Trim levels were standard, Deluxe and XE, while price range were between US$4,949 for the base two-door sedan up to US$6,899 for the two-door XE hatchback coupe. Standard equipment on all models were four-wheel independent suspension, front disc brakes and rear drums, rack and pinion steering, maintenance free battery, rear ashtray and bucket seats. Deluxe models added halogen headlamps, remote-locking gas filler door, carpeted trunk and rear wiper-washer on the wagon. Deluxe and XE offered tinted glass, trip odometer, vanity mirror, dual remote mirrors and door trim. XE offered cut pile carpeting, analogue quartz clock, remote rear window opener, low-fuel warning light, AM-FM Clarion stereo radio, power steering, tachometer and 155/13 whitewall radial tires. Sunroof was available as an option.
The Sentra quickly became a success, partly due to the appeal of low fuel consumption. In its first year of sales, it was already the best-selling import in the U.S. and the fourth best-selling passenger car overall (together with the earlier 210), with 191,312 units sold of both cars. The Sentra ended the 1983 year as the eighth-most sold passenger car, with 209,889 units.The 1983 model-year introduced a 1.7 L CD17 I4 diesel engine, mated with a four-speed manual transmission. Also, the 1.5 L was replaced by a 69 hp (51 kW) 1.6 L E16 as the standard engine, available with a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic. Later that year the Sentra also received an electronically controlled carburetor.In April 1985, Nissan started production of the Sentra in the Smyrna, Tennessee plant, after a US$85 million investment. The 1985 model-year received minor exterior changes: aerodynamically styled headlamps, a new grille and blackwall tires replaced the old whitewall tires. A sporty SE option was introduced. The SE was only available in the two-door hatchback model and included alloy wheels, black lower body paint and black out grille. Also, automatic transmission was optional on all Sentras except two-door base sedan, MPG Diesel and SE coupe. Prices were starting at US$5,499. The diesel engine was discontinued in the U.S. market soon thereafter. Consumer Reports magazine ranked the B11 reliability as "better than average" in 1985.Regarding the safety of the B11 model, it was ranked the seventh safest car in a rank made by the Center for Auto Safety in 1983, which examined the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) testing, consisting of frontal crashes at 35 miles per hour.In Mexico it was called the Nissan Tsuru, being the first car named as Nissan in this country. Also, the three-door hatchback coupé was known as the Nissan Tsuru Samurai. For 1986, the 1.5 L engine was replaced by the 1.6 L and for 1987 the Tsuru Samurai received a sporty version called the Nissan Ninja Turbo which included a low boost turbocharger with carburator and prominent Ninja stickers on the low side of the doors. The regular Sunny Coupé was also sold as the "Nissan Ninja" in 1987, equipped with the 80 hp (60 kW) E16S while the locally developed turbocharged version of that engine (E16T) with 93 hp (69 kW).


== B12 (1985–1990) ==

This generation carried on the multitude of body styles that the B11 had, including a station wagon, two-door or four-door sedan, three-door hatchback and the hatchback-bodied Sport Coupé. The B12 chassis was first produced and marketed in 1985 in most parts of the world; however, it was not offered to the United States until 1986. For the 1987 model, all Sentras came standard with the E16 engine with 69 hp (51 kW) (excepting the Sport Coupé and four-wheel-drive wagon, which came with throttle-body-injected E16i engines) and a five-speed manual transmission. In 1988, all Sentras had the 70 hp (52 kW) E16i, which was offered for this year with throttle body injection (TBI). In many parts of the world the E-series soldiered on in the B12 chassis with some getting the multi-point fuel injection E16E engine. Diesel engines were also offered in some models, but were rare and only available in North American 1987 models and in certain other parts of the world. From 1989 to 1990, the only engine choice was the 90 hp (67 kW) GA16i, a 12-valve SOHC predecessor of the GA16DE. Transaxles offered were the 4- and 5-speed manuals (RN4F31A and RS5F31A, respectively) and a 3-speed automatic with torque converter lockup (RL3F01A).
The B12 carried over a radically modified 4-wheel independent suspension from the B11, with 4-wheel disc brakes an option in some parts of the world. This was the start of the model classes which were standard through the 2003 model year (not all classes were available every year) having the E as the base-level economy car, the XE as the next-up model, the GXE as the top level for the 4-door sedan, the sporty SE coupe, and the SE-R (Not available in the US market) as the top of the line performance model. The GXE (available from 1987 to 2003) had a body colored bumper, aero side mirrors with manual remote control, tachometer as well as standard 13" 175/70R13 alloy wheels along with air-conditioning, variable intermittent wipers, but no standard cassette deck nor any power windows/locks/mirrors. The SE also had dual mirrors, air conditioning, tachometer, and power door locks and windows in some markets and possibly electronic fuel injection.
The B12 chassis would be the last chassis to offer a station wagon model, which was marketed as the "California" in some Asian markets. Even more rare are the four-wheel drive versions of the station wagon, offered as an option in 1987, 1988 and 1989 model years. These models featured an electrically activated single-range transfer case to drive the independently suspended rear wheels, making the car a selectable four-wheel-drive (not all-wheel-drive) vehicle.
1989 saw a subtle change in the body style of the Sentra coupe and sedan, as new larger, more rounded front corner lights were introduced to the front fenders and redesigned taillights were added to the rear fascia (station wagon retained same rear lights). The Nissan logo on the front grille was relocated from the right hand side to the center. In 1990, electrically retracted front shoulder belts were added, as well as 3-point harnesses for the rear passengers, excluding the center rear passenger.
The Sport Coupe was a sportier style of the Sentra. It shared none of the body components with the standard model. It was only available with the E16i or GA16i. All Sport Coupes had dual sway bars, dual remote-adjust mirrors, and a tachometer instrument cluster. The SE model added features like air conditioning and rear speakers. All B12 Sentras used the same wiring harness, regardless of options installed on any particular vehicle.
B12s are known for reliability and excellent fuel economy, and are considered by enthusiasts to be good low budget project cars due to interchangeability of parts between generations and with other Nissan models.
In Canada, the B12 four-door sedan remained available through the 1993 model year. Essentially a rebadged Nissan Tsuru II built in Mexico, it was called Sentra Classic to distinguish it from the B13 model released for 1991. It replaced the Nissan Micra 3/5-door hatchbacks which were discontinued that time as a price-leader model. All 1991–93 "Classic" models came with the 70 hp (52 kW) E16i and the choice of two transmissions, a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic.
In Mexico, it was named the Nissan Tsuru II, available in 2, 4 door sedans and wagon, while the Coupé was named the Nissan Hikari. They were produced and marketed locally between 1988 and 1991. For 1988 for the 4 door Tsuru II and the Hikari had available the Turbo EGI (fuel injected) 1.6 L engine in a very rare, sporty version. It was one of the most reliable cars in its time in Mexico, being a great sales success. This generation was also exported to some central and south american markets such as Peru, Chile and Bolivia.
In the Philippines, it was initially offered in three trims namely the 1.7 DX (diesel), 1.3 SLX and the 1.5 SGX, the wagon version was also available in the 1.5 SGX trim and was called the Nissan California. In mid 1989, the Sentra model line was freshened up and the engines were upgraded to 1.4- (LX) and 1.6-liter. The 1.6 SGX gained power steering, windows, door locks and side mirrors, a first in its class. The second-generation B12 also had a diesel variant which had the 1.7 CD17 engine. The second wagon version (known as Nissan California 1.6 SGX) also had all power features.

		
		
		
		
		


== B13 (1990–1994) ==
The sedan came standard with the fuel-injected 110-126 hp (94 kW) and 108 pound-feet (146 N⋅m) 1.6-liter 16-valve 4-cylinder GA16DE engine. It came in the base model, E, XE, SE, and GXE. The GXE came with power package such as power windows/locks/mirrors while the XE, SE, SE-R came with standard or optional sunroof and alloy wheels. Four-door models came with front motorized shoulder seatbelts. The short-lived three-door hatchback of the B12 Sentra was not replaced in this generation, and the sporting coupé version was replaced by the ovoid Nissan NX.
For the 1992 model year (August 1991 – July 1992 production), a passenger's side vanity mirror and black body-side moldings became standard on the Sentra 2-door. The Value Option Package (air conditioning, cruise control, and a stereo system) was extended to SE models. The optional three-speed automatic in the E coupe was dropped and gained an optional 4-speed automatic, shared with other models.


=== Facelift ===
From August 1992 production, the B13 received a facelift for the 1993 model year. All Sentras received interior updates, new front and rear fascias. A driver's airbag was also made standard on the GXE and optional on the rest of the range for 1993. An XE Limited model was added for both the coupe and sedan.
For 1994 models (August 1993 production), a CFC-free refrigerant became standard on models equipped with air conditioning. XE models got more standard equipment that included air conditioning, cruise control and a stereo cassette player. The XE Limited was dropped for 1994. In May 1994, a 1994.5 "Limited" model was released as a placeholder for a delayed replacement, due in early 1995.


=== Sentra SE-R ===
The B13 was the first to offer Nissan's famous and then-new SR20DE engine in the sporty two-door SE-R model. Setting subcompact speed records of the time, the Sentra SE-R came with 140 hp (104.4 kW) at 6400 rpm and 132 lb⋅ft (179 N⋅m) of torque at 4800 rpm. It could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (100 km/h) in 7.6 seconds and the quarter-mile in 15.8 seconds. It came with 4-wheel disc brakes and had a MacPherson strut independent suspension. Further improving the handling was a viscous limited-slip differential, which was standard equipment on the SE-R. The B13 SE-R returns 21 mpg‑US (11 L/100 km; 25 mpg‑imp) city/29 mpg‑US (8.1 L/100 km; 35 mpg‑imp) highway.


=== Philippines ===
The B13 was released in JX, LEC, EX Saloon, Super Saloon and SE Saloon variants. The Super Saloon had all power features. The SE-Saloon came as a Limited edition equipped with four-wheel disc brakes and ABS. Both SE and Super Saloon come standard with the GA16DE.
The B13 SuperSaloon and SE Saloon came with the GA16DE fuel-injected engine (top of the line engine for the Philippine market) which is comparable to the U.S Spec B13 SE Limited with loaded options. These models are not equipped with emissions equipment – catalytic converters and sensors as well as EGR. B13's where sold new from 1990 to 1999. The LEC version comes with the standard GA13 carburated engine as well as the LEC Ps (Power Steering model). The JX comes with the GA14 carburated engine.


=== Nissan Tsuru/V16 (1992–2017) ===
The Mexican-built Sentra B13 was sold in Mexico for 25 years as well as parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Central America and South America. It is known as the Nissan Tsuru in Mexico, Nissan V16 in Chile, Sentra B13 in Central America countries. and Sentra Clásico in Peru and the Dominican Republic. Tsuru vehicles destined for the Mexican market were modified by Nissan Mexicana specifically for the Mexican market and for the most part are identical to the 1991 model except for a new Renault clutch/transmission, updated Mexican made electronic systems and minor cosmetic and ergonomic upgrades.
The Tsuru was the most popular car in Mexico from 1997 until 2011 when it was surpassed by the Mexican made Volkswagen Jetta. The Middle East/African export market version is the same basic car only with minor cosmetic changes and mechanical downgrades to make it cheaper, such as non-power steering, downgraded interior trim, a downgraded braking system, and a mechanical clutch instead of a hydraulic one.
Vehicles sold in the Middle East region are not equipped with catalytic converters to make the car cheaper to build. Because of the lack of the catalytic converter the vehicles are illegal in Mexico and South America. More recent models have received a Renault-built hydraulic clutch and an optional catalytic converter. Its affordable price, relatively good fuel economy, easy to fix and find spare parts make it popular among local taxi drivers and low income families in Mexico, South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Tsuru is commonly used for the taxicab livery in Mexico as a replacement for the VW Beetle – much like its predecessor, Tsurus have been sighted in the Southwest United States since Mexican nationals can operate them in the USA as long as it has the valid registration documents (they are illegal for sale and/or export into the USA since it does not meet the DOT's safety requirements e.g. airbags and electronic stability control and are less than 25 years old). Due to the passing of stricter automobile safety regulations in Mexico, production of the Tsuru was discontinued in May 2017, as the Tsuru lacked both anti-lock brakes and airbags. A special commemorative edition limited to 1000 cars went on sale in March 2017.


== B14 (1994-2002) ==
Introduced on January 5, 1995, the Sentra changed from an independent rear suspension to a torsion beam setup. Some variants were not equipped with a rear swaybar or rear disc brakes. Many of these vehicles equipped with the 1.6-liter DOHC engine that had Nissan's Variable Intake Valve Timing Control System (NVTCS) and standard 5-speed manual transmission can achieve upwards of 30–40 MPG depending on conditions. This generation is also the first generation in Mexico wearing the Sentra name. It is also the first Sentra generation exclusively sold in sedan form, as the coupe was dropped in favour of the Nissan 200SX reintroduction. The revived 200SX also replaced the related Nissan NX.
All engines in the B14 line up came with timing chains, designed to last the vehicle's lifetime.
The B14 sentra platform was offered several trims, Base, XE, GXE, GLE, SE and SE Limited. Base and XE come with 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps, GXE prior to 1998 also included 13-inch wheels. The only difference between trims is the GXE and up come with rear seat trunk access, rear headrests, a grip-assist handle on the passenger side, additional fabric on doors and seats as opposed to vinyl, power windows, locks, mirrors, etc. The GLE, SE, and Special Edition include in some instances leather, rear spoiler and moonroof, and keyless entry packages. All trims except the SE and SE-R have the GA16DE 1.6 L engine producing 115 hp (86 kW) and 108 pound-feet (146 N⋅m). The SE and SE-R received the SR20DE 2.0L engine with 140 hp (104 kW). The 200SX SE-R came with leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob and even Limited-Slip-Differential until 1997.


=== SE ===
The sedan got all the performance parts (minus the limited-slip differential) in 1998 with the Sentra SE. The SE sedan came with the same 2.0-liter SR20DE engine as the SE-R. This generation saw the end of assembly in Smyrna, Tennessee.


=== Engines ===
GA16DE: 1.6 (1,597 cc) DOHC with a 6,900 rpm redline and 115 hp (86 kW) at 6,000 rpm, 110 lb.ft at 4,000 rpm, available in 5-speed manual/4-speed automatic; 30/40mpg 5sp. man., 28/37 4sp. auto. Acceleration 0–60 mph in 8.5 seconds for a 95 GXE M/T (Car and Driver 6/95).
SR20DE: 2.0 (1,998 cc) DOHC with a 7,300 rpm redline and 140 hp (100 kW) at 6,400 rpm, 132 lb.ft at 4,800 rpm in SE and 200SX SE-R; 23/31mpg 5-speed manual, 23/30 4-speed automatic, 0–60 mph in 8.1 seconds.

== B15 (2000–2006) ==

The Sentra finally crossed over into the "compact" class when the redesigned model launched in February 2000 as a 2000 model. When new, this redesign was considered a substantial upgrade, compared to the "cheap" economy car it replaced. Previously, the compact class had been occupied by the Altima, which moved to the mid-size class in 2001, and its wheelbase remained unchanged from the previous generation. While earlier Sentras were very similar to their Japan-market B-series Nissan Sunny twins, the B15 Sentra diverged greatly from the B15 Sunny (Nissan Super Sunny). Production shifted from Smyrna, Tennessee to Aguascalientes, Mexico, and the Smyrna production line was retooled to build the Nissan Xterra. The 2000–2001 Sentra SE with the SR20DE Roller rocker motor, which has 145 hp (108 kW) and 136 lb⋅ft (184 N⋅m) of torque, occupied the top of the line Sentra until the SE-R returned for model year 2002. The 1.6 L GA16DE engine was dropped in favor of the 1.8 L QG18DE(1809 or 1769cc), rated at 126 hp (94 kW) and 129 pound-feet (175 N⋅m) . In Brazil, this engine generated 113 hp (84 kW) at 5,600 rpm and 114 lb⋅ft (155 N⋅m) at 4,400 rpm. Numerous upgrades were made over the previous generation. The new model featured a new interior with higher quality plastics and more comfortable seats. The exterior was also substantially updated and now featured body-side moldings and clear headlights. The curb weight on the QG18DE-engined Sentra is 2,513 lb (1,140 kg). With the introduction of the B15 in year 2000, Nissan also introduced a CA 'Clean Air' trim only available in California. The CA trim boasts a double walled exhaust, 3 catalytic converters, quick catalyst warm up, and a radiator that has a special coating which actually changes ground level ozone (smog) into oxygen. The Sentra CA model is the only gasoline-fueled vehicle in the world to receive California Air Resources Board (CARB) super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV) certification and obtain zero-emission credits.In markets where the B15 Sentra or Sunny was not sold, Nissan usually sold a similar car called the Nissan Bluebird Sylphy (G10/N16) in Japan but under other names elsewhere. In Europe, the Bluebird Sylphy was known as the Nissan Almera (N16) and Australia and New Zealand as the Nissan Pulsar (N16). The G10/N16 is constructed on the same platform as the B15 and features the same interior and engines.


=== Sentra SE-R ===

In 2001 for the 2002 model year, a new SE-R was introduced powered by the 2.5-liter QR25DE 165 hp (123 kW) and 175 pound-feet (237 N⋅m) 4-cylinder. The SE-R came with a 5-speed RS5F51A manual transmission or optional 4-speed automatic. The 5-speed manual was dropped in 2003 models, which consequently made the only available transmission a 4-speed automatic.
A more aggressive front fascia was added thanks to a Nissan Skyline inspired front bumper for 2002 models. Black housing headlights, fog-lights, side skirts, a rear spoiler, a dual-tip muffler, and 16" aluminum-alloy wheels were also standard. This trim also featured a sport-tuned suspension, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and beige sport seat cloth.


=== Sentra SE-R Spec V ===
The Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V was the more performance oriented sport compact version of the Nissan Sentra. Its engine (also shared with the SE-R) was the same 2.5-liter QR25DE unit originally created for the Nissan Altima and Frontier pickups. This engine produced 175 hp (130 kW) at 6000 rpm and 180 lb⋅ft (244 N⋅m) of torque at 4000 rpm. It was mated to a six-speed RS6F51H manual transmission and a helical limited slip differential; which served as the only transmission of choice for the Spec V.
The car's handling was aided with more aggressive tuning of the car's suspension (in comparison to lower trim models) and the addition of low-profile 17-inch wheels. A front strut tower brace, firmer springs, revised shock damping, firmer front polyurethane bushings, dual-tip muffler, and front stabilizer bars were all standard. A four-wheel anti-lock braking system (which was packaged with front-seat side-impact air bags) was also optional equipment on all 2002-2006 models. Specific to the 2004-2006 model years; potential buyers could also purchase a 4 piston Brembo brake caliper upgrade.
This model also came with a standard race-inspired sporty interior, such as Nissan Skyline inspired seats and a thick leather-wrapped steering wheel. Other optional features at the time included a Rockford Fosgate 300-watt nine-speaker audio system (with an 8-inch (200 mm) subwoofer in the trunk), six-disc autochanger, and a power sunroof. Other equipment include sportier-looking headlights with black surrounding the silver reflectors, standard fog-lights, lower-body sill extensions and a rear spoiler.
Initially, for 2002 and 2003, the SE-R Spec V (along with the SE-R) was given an aggressive front fascia (styled after the Skyline GT-R) with side still extensions and rear trunk-mounted spoiler. Originally, speculation arose surrounding the Spec V designation being a play on the GT-R V-Spec Skyline name. This speculation has been proven to be true with the introduction of the R35 GT-R Spec V in North America. The Spec V designation is due to the fact that for some unknown legal reason Nissan cannot use the V-Spec title in the US market.


=== Sentra 2.5 LE and 2.5S ===
The QR25DE was not only sported in the SE-R and SE-R Spec V trims of the B15 Sentra, but also came in the 2003 Sentra 2.5LE and 2004 Sentra 2.5S. These versions did not sport any exterior resemblance to the SE-R trims; they clone the exterior and interior of the lower trims (GXE, 1.8S), to include clear head lamps, beige-colored interior cloth, and softer suspension than the SE-R's. The only available transmission was a 4-speed automatic. These trims offered the appearance of a standard Sentra coupled with the power of an SE-R.


=== 2004 model year update ===

In 2003, the 2004 model year saw a minor facelift for all Sentras. Gearing was changed in 2003–2006 SE-R Spec V for quicker quarter-mile times of 15.2. SE-R's came only in automatic transmission from 2003 to 2006 and are capable of a quarter-mile time of 16.0. The SE-R (Spec-V included) retained the different headlights and gained "smoked-out" tail lights.


==== Special Edition ====
The Special Edition of the Sentra 1.8L was produced for model years 2005 and 2006. Exterior features included a rear spoiler, fog lights, SE-R-style front grille, and 16-inch alloy wheels borrowed from the SE-R model. Interior features included 320-watt six-disc Rockford Fosgate nine-speaker sound system, and a charcoal cloth interior and leather-wrapped wheel borrowed from the SE-R model. The only available engine was the QG18DE paired with either a four-speed automatic or very limited five-speed manuals.


==== SE-R/SE-R Spec V ====

For the 2004–2006 model years, no significant cosmetic changes were added to differentiate the SE-R model, although it still retained its side-skirt extensions, rear spoiler, black housing headlights and newly designed wheels. The 2004 model year also featured a new style of tail-light which is reminiscent of the Skyline GT-R's quadruple taillights. Volcanic Orange, an exclusive color for the SE-R and Spec V trim was available for 2004–2006 models.
The interior was also redesigned accordingly. Starting in 2005, the "SE-R" badged "goose-neck" shifter handle from the previous models was replaced by an all black, leather stitched ball-top shifter. The original two-tone interior cloth found in Spec V models, which was originally red and black for 2002, later changed to gray and black for 2003–2004, was changed to all-black mesh for the final two years of production.
A brake package featuring Brembo four-piston calipers up front, 12" vented front discs and 10.9" rear discs was available for 2004–2006 Spec V models. ABS was unavailable with this package.
Nismo offered a S-Tune and R-Tune upgrade starting in 2004, which could be dealer installed or modified by the owner. The S-Tune package came with a Nismo stainless cat-back exhaust, Nismo springs and shocks, Nismo brake pads, Nismo 23mm front anti-roll bar, and lighter Nismo 17" wheels. The R-Tune package included all of the former, along with a Nismo header, Nismo cold-air intake, rear Nismo 25mm anti-roll bar, Nismo cams, Nismo lower tie bar, and a Nismo hard bushing kit. Nismo cosmetic upgrades were also available, which included a Nismo rear spoiler, and a front and rear Nismo under spoiler/lip.


=== Transmissions ===
The 2000–2006 2.0 L (SR20DE) and 1.8L (QG18DE) automatics use the 4 speed RE4F03B transmission. The 2.5-litre (QR25DE)  2.5S and SE-R automatics use the 4 speed RE4F04B transmission. The 2002–2006 SE-R Spec Vs used the 6 speed P12 RS6H51 6 speed tranmssion with limited slip.
The SE-R Spec V QR25's horsepower were rated at 175 hp (130 kW) at 6,000 rpm and 180 lb⋅ft (244 N⋅m) of torque at 4,500 rpm.


== B16 (2007–2012) ==

Nissan introduced the sixth generation Sentra at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January. Classified as a mid-size sedan by the EPA thanks to its interior passenger and cargo volume of 110 cubic feet (as the EPA considers "mid" or "intermediate" size a car with interior passenger and cargo volume between 110 and 119 cubic feet), the Sentra is bigger in every dimension than the B15 model, being 65 mm (2.3 in.) longer, 91 mm (3.2 in.) wider, and 113 mm (4.0 in.) taller. The wheelbase is also 167 mm (5.9 in.) longer than the previous model. The sixth generation also marked a change in Nissan's North American lineup, with the Nissan Versa becoming brand's entry-level model. This generation is based on the C platform architecture that also underpins the first-generation Nissan Rogue, Nissan Qashqai and also the T31 Nissan X-Trail, as well as other Renault models. The Sentra's standard engine is a 2.0-liter 16-valve 4-cylinder rated at 140 hp (104 kW) and 147 pound-feet (199 N⋅m) of torque. Fuel economy for with the 2.0L mated to the CVT is rated at 26 city/34 hwy, and the 6-speed manual at 24 city/31 hwy. SE-R is rated at 24 city/30 hwy with the CVT being the only transmission available. SE-R Spec-V is rated at 21 city/28 hwy mated with the 6-speed manual.
In 2007 and 2008, Nissan considered marketing a hybrid version of the Sentra, particularly when the price of oil rose to over $100 per barrel. However the price soon retreated below $40, and Nissan decided instead to focus on future hydrogen fuel cell and electric vehicles. Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has indicated that he will not attempt to match Toyota and Honda in terms of hybrid models offered for retail sale. This decision has left Nissan without a compact hybrid product to compete with Toyota Prius, the Honda Civic Hybrid, and relaunched Honda Insight. Nissan's only hybrid product on the American market is the Altima Hybrid, which competes with the Toyota Camry Hybrid and the Ford Fusion Hybrid.

For 2010, the Sentra received a mid-cycle refresh. It revisions included a new, Altima-inspired grille, a revised lower fascia and slightly different headlights. In back, new taillights (though almost identical to previous years) and additional chrome trim pieces on the trunk and side moldings highlight the major changes. New trimlines are offered to balance out the prices. Inside is a new red back-lighting color for the speedometer and knobs, and a new CD player with an optional navigation system. The new audio system includes iPod and USB integration on certain models, as well as a backup camera. Fog lamps are no longer standard on the 2.0S and SL model and leather seats are now only available as an option rather than standard on the SL model for 2010, which is reflected in the new, lower MSRP. The Brazilian export variant features a flexible fuel engine and retractable side mirrors were adopted from the Nissan Versa.
The B16 generation was introduced in the Philippines (where it is sold as Sentra 200 and replaces Pulsar-based N16 model) and Argentina in 2010.
Until March 2011, the Sentra has sold 948 units in Argentina.


=== SE-R/SE-R Spec V (2007–2012) ===

Nissan introduced a new version of the SE-R to the North American market for the 2007 model year. The SE-R is available in two versions: SE-R base and SE-R Spec V. Both get four-wheel disc brakes in place of the standard Sentra's disc/drum setup, unique interior and exterior trim and 17-inch alloy wheels. Both are powered by a redesigned 2.5-liter QR25DE engine. Each model also comes standard with a sport grille, lower body side sill extensions, rear spoiler, fog lights, chrome exhaust-tip finisher, smoked headlight surround and smoked taillights. Unique interior features include black sport seat cloth with red stitching and SE-R embroidered logos, sport metallic-tone accents, aluminium pedal pads, and twin pod meters with oil pressure and G-sensor displays. Also, the 2007-2012 Sentra SER was the only Sentra in the lineup to not change its front bumper design in 2010.
A sunroof package was optional, featuring power sliding glass sunroof with tilt feature, and dual illuminated visor vanity mirrors. An Audio package, featuring a 340-watt Rockford Fosgate 6-CD audio system, with eight speakers (two subwoofers, four mid-range woofers, and two tweeters) was also available.
The SE-R base model is rated at 177 hp (132 kW) at 6000 rpm and 172 lb⋅ft (233 N⋅m) at 2800 rpm and comes exclusively with Nissan's Sport-tuned Xtronic CVT continuously variable transmission and steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters. Suspension upgrades included a front-stabilizer bar (23.0mm) and sport-tuned springs. It featured 11.7" vented front discs and 11.5" rear discs brakes. The SE-R base model started at $19,400 (MSRP).
The SE-R Spec V is rated at 200 hp (149 kW) at 6600 rpm and 180 lb⋅ft (244 N⋅m) at 5200 rpm and comes with a 6-speed manual and optional limited-slip differential. It is capable of 0–60 mph times of 6.7 seconds and a 1/4 mile time of 15.1 seconds at 92.6 mph. On the track, slalom figures resulted in 64.7 mph and .86g at the skidpad. Compression is bumped up to 10.5:1, compared to 9.6:1 in the SE-R base. Front disc brakes are also increased to 12.6". Exclusive suspension upgrades include a sport-tuned suspension with lowered height, sport-tuned shocks and struts, reinforced upper cowl, trunk-mounted V-brace, and a larger front stabilizer bar (25mm). Unique interior features included red front seat belts, leather-wrapped steering wheel with red stitching, and a leather wrapped shift knob. The SE-R Spec V model started at $19,900 (MSRP). 2012 was the final model of the SE-R and Spec V performance variant.


=== SL ===
The Sentra also has a limited version known as the SL. It has a navigation system with leather interior. Usually has an automatic transmission.


=== FE+ 2.0 SR (2009–2012) ===
It is a Sentra 2.0 S with sport-inspired exterior enhancements, including SE-R-style front and rear fascias, side sills and rear spoiler, sport grille, dark chrome bezel headlights and dark smoked bezel taillights, 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, exhaust tip, and "SR" trunk lid badge. It was available in 6 exterior colors, including the limited Sentra SE-R/SE-R Spec V colors, and was offered exclusively with a Charcoal cloth interior.
The car was sold for US$17,760, same as the Sentra FE+ 2.0 S model.


=== Flex fuel ===
Nissan launched in August 2009 in Brazil a FFV variant of the B16 Sentra. It features the same MR20DE engine, but capable of running on hydrated ethanol (E100) or a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25 percent of anhydrous ethanol (mandatory blend since 1993) or a mix of both in any proportion.The engine received a new electronic control unit (ECU) supplied by Bosch and ethanol corrosive-action-resistant internal components. Among these new parts are the intake and exhaust valves and seals made with new materials, the first piston ring made with anodized steel, more resistant connecting rods, fuel injectors suitable for use in ethanol and double-layer exhaust gas oxygen to increase the moisture resistance of the fuel. The power rose to 141 hp (143 cv) both in gasoline and ethanol. Compression ratio of 9.7:1 was kept unchanged.At the time it was launched, there was some controversy regarding the possibility of vehicles equipped with CVT transmission be converted to flex fuel, since this was the statement that was made by Honda Motor of Brazil in the launch of the second generation Honda Fit in Brazil. During the 2008 upgrade of the Honda Fit, the CVT system was replaced by a conventional automatic transmission and according to the manufacturer it was not possible to attach the CVT transmission infinite relations to a flex fuel engine. Honda's decision to change the type of transmission reduced manufacturing costs and Brazilian auto press inquired the truth of that statement following the release of the CVT-equipped Sentra FFV.


== B17 (2013–2019) ==
A preview of the 2013 Nissan Sentra was revealed at the 2012 Beijing Auto Show.Nissan unveiled the seventh generation Sentra in August 2012. The new Sentra is completely redesigned inside and out, with styling upscaled to look more similar to Nissan's other sedans, the Altima and Maxima including LED taillights, LED accents in the headlights, and a new navigation and electronics system.The new MRA8DE 1.8-liter 16-valve DOHC inline-four is offered for better fuel economy than the previous model, ratings are 30 city/39 highway. The engine output returns 130 hp (97 kW) and 128 lb⋅ft (174 N⋅m) of torque. It provides less power than the outgoing Sentra, but due to a new platform, it is 150 lbs lighter in weight.

In Brazil, the B17 Sentra is offered with the MR20DE Nissan 2.0 engine, the same used in the previous Sentra model due to market demands (all direct competitors use a 2.0 engine). The model exported and sold in Brazil is built in Aguascalientes, Mexico.
Similar to the outgoing model, the new Sentra is offered in S, FE+ S, SV, FE+ SV, SR, and SL trim levels. All trims will be equipped with a reworked CVT except the base S model, which has an optional six-speed manual transmission. There is no SE-R or SE-R Spec V version of this model.
In Australia, this generation went on sale in early 2013 and is sold as the Nissan Pulsar.
Nissan Sentra debuted in Russian market in 2014. The car is powered with 1.6 engine (117 hp) fitted with 5-speed manual or CVT. Sentra for Russian market is locally built in Izhevsk.

The NISMO model gets a lowered performance-tuned suspension, racing seats, LED taillights, red interior trim as well as a NISMO specific body kit with bumper equipped LED DRLs and NISMO wheels.


=== 2018 Taiwanese Sentra facelift ===

In the Taiwanese market, the B17 Nissan Sentra has not been facelifted apart from receiving a sportier variant called the Sentra Aero in 2014. The B17 Sentra was finally updated with the V motion front fascia in November 2017 for the 2018 model year, but the facelift was a version exclusive to the Taiwanese market conducted by Yulon Motors, the manufacturer of Nissan products in Taiwan. The facelift preserves the pre-facelift front fenders and hood with only the headlights and front bumper redesigned to save cost. The rest of the vehicle is inline with the international 2016 facelift versions, including new alloys, new taillights and new rear bumpers.


== B18 (2020–) ==

The B18 series Sentra was unveiled at the November 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show. It is based on the Chinese-market Sylphy.


== Other versions ==


=== New Zealand ===
In countries such as New Zealand, vehicles from both the Nissan Sunny and Nissan Pulsar ranges were marketed as a single model range (with the exception of the Pulsar, which included an EXA model identical to the North American Pulsar), the "Nissan Sentra", which differed (apart from the station wagon) from the models sold under the same name in the United States.
The Sentra name was adopted in several other countries, such as New Zealand, where it was used for the Nissan Pulsar range from 1986 (although the station wagon version was actually a rebadged Nissan Sunny California). The Sentra name continued to be used in New Zealand for the Pulsar until 1998, just as Almera was used in Europe. After 2002, the Pulsar name was adopted.
Unlike the North American version, a hatchback was offered; engines offered were 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 2.0 L petrol engines; a diesel was available in Europe. Some were sold in the Republic of Ireland.


=== Southeast Asia ===

In Southeast Asia, the Nissan Bluebird Sylphy N16 was marketed as the Nissan Sentra in Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. A facelifted version was introduced specifically for this region at the end of 2005, which was offered instead of the second generation Nissan Bluebird Sylphy, also launched at the end of 2005.In Taiwan, Yulon has built its licensed version of the Sunny as the Sentra since 1990. The Taiwanese-market Sentra reflects the styling of the Japanese-market Bluebird Sylphy (also as the Almera/Pulsar sedan but with a luxury emphasis). This N16 model is called Sentra M1. The Nissan Sentra nameplate returned in October 2013 as B17, marketed as Nissan Super Sentra.
In Indonesia, the first and second generations Sentra were the Sunny-based B12 and B13 models respectively. The 1988–1990 B12 was offered as SGX Sedan and SR Coupe. The B13 was nicknamed Sentra Genesis, only sold as sedan from 1991 to 1996. After skipping six years, Nissan re-introduced the Sentra in Indonesia in 2002. The Sentra was now based on the N16 Pulsar or Nissan Bluebird Sylphy. It is powered by a 1.8-liter QG18 engine matched to a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Sentra was only offered in luxury Super Saloon trim level, loaded with standard ABS and leather interior. However, it was sold only in small numbers until 2004.
The Philippines also used the Sentra name for its version of the Pulsar. The N16 model was known as the Nissan Sentra Exalta (available from 2001 to 2003). The early model is similar to the JDM Bluebird Sylphy. Nissan Philippines introduced a model with new headlights and tail lights, that was later renamed back to Sentra. This model was known as the Sunny Neo in Thailand. These N16 Sentras have QG series powerplants and are sold in three variants namely the 1.3L GX (QG13DE), GSX (QG16DE) and the top of the line GS (QG16DE). Starting the third quarter of 2010, the Nissan Sentra B16 became available in the Philippines included in the new line-up of automobiles from Nissan Motor Philippines (NMPI). It is called the new Nissan Sentra 200 with an MR20 engine available in two variants: 6-speed manual and Xtronic CVT transmission.

Pangamic acid

Pangamic acid, also called pangamate, is the name given to the chemical compound described as d-gluconodimethylamino acetic acid, initially 
promoted by Ernst T. Krebs, Sr. and his son Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. as a medicinal compound for use in treatment of a wide range of diseases.  They also termed this chemical "Vitamin B15", though it is not a true vitamin, has no nutritional value, has no known use in the treatment of any disease and has been called a "quack remedy".  Although a number of compounds labelled "pangamic acid" have been studied or sold, no chemical compound, including those claimed by the Krebses to be pangamic acid, has been scientifically verified to have the characteristics that defined the original description of the compound.
The Krebses derived the term "pangamic" to describe this compound which they asserted to be ubiquitous and highly concentrated in seeds (pan meaning "universal" and gamic meaning "seed").


== Chemistry ==
Pangamic acid is the name given to the chemical compound with the empirical formula C10H19O8N and a molecular weight of 281 which appeared to be an ester derived from d-gluconic acid and dimethylglycine. In 1943, the Krebses applied for a patent for a process for extracting this chemical compound which they reported had been previously isolated from apricot seeds, and received the patent in 1949.  A 1951 paper by the Krebses reported the first isolation of this compound using this patented process, but did not include enough information to confirm that this compound was actually isolated.  In 1955, the Krebses received a patent for another synthesizing process for "N-substituted glycine esters of gluconic acid," but the patent contained no supporting data to confirm the process was able to synthesize compounds described by the patent, including pangamic acid.Subsequent attempts at synthesizing this ester by other researchers found Krebs' purported methods of producing pangamic acid were not reproducible, and research into pangamic acid have focused on compounds of various chemical compositions.  A review noted that of all the chemicals described in research about pangamic acid, "[n]ot a single product labeled "pangamate" or "B15" has been established in a scientifically verifiable manner to conform to the empiric formula" described by the Krebses.  Analysis of a sample of a compound called "pangamic acid" which was provided by a co-worker of the Krebses in the 1950s showed only lactose upon further evaluation by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Thus, "pangamic acid" is more a label used to describe one of any number of chemical compounds rather than a particular substance.Chemical compounds sold as "pangamic acid" for medicinal purposes have also had various chemical compositions, and suppliers of "pangamic acid" have regularly changed the chemical composition of the compounds sold under this label.  One anecdote noted that the FDA has seized lots of calcium pangamate sold by General Nutrition Center (GNC), which agreed to stop selling the compound in those bottles after the FDA filed suit to stop sales.  Afterwards, it was noted that GNC was still selling something in the same bottles with the same labels, likely a different compound.   Due to ambiguity in situations like this, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it "not an identifiable substance."


== Clinical claims and research ==
The Krebses' original patent claimed pangamic acid could be used for detoxification as well as treatment of asthma, skin conditions, joint pain, and nerve pain, with none of these claims supported by evidence in the patent application.  Early promotion for pangamic acid included use by race horses as well as humans.  Although given the name "Vitamin B15" by the Krebses, there is no evidence that it meets the definition of a vitamin as there is no evidence it is a nutrient needed by the body.Much of the clinical research on pangamic acid took place in the former Soviet Union, though that research often did not describe which of the many compounds called "pangamic acid" was used in the study.  This research was also of limited quality due to being overwhelmingly anecdotal in nature (as opposed to controlled experimentation) and ignoring short and long term safety in human use.Although more recent claims include treatment of a wide variety of conditions including cancer, heart disease, schizophrenia as well as providing improvement in oxygen utilization, there is no significant evidence for any of these claims or that it is safe for human use.  One review noted that it meets "the criteria that define a quack remedy."


== Safety ==
Positive results from mutagenicity analysis via the Ames test of compounds commonly found in preparations labelled "pangamic acid" including diisopropylamine dichloroacetate, diisopropylamine, dichloroacetate, as well as dimethylglycine mixed with sodium nitrite suggests there may be concern for the development of cancer with the use of these substances.


== Legal status ==
The United States Food and Drug Administration has recommended seizing any chemicals advertised as pangamic acid and restraining the importation and interstate shipment of pangamic acid on the grounds that pangamic acid and pangamic acid products are unsafe for use and have no known nutritional properties.  Pangamic acid's distribution in Canada has been prohibited by the then-named Canadian Food and Drug Directorate.

Bundesstraße 15

The Bundesstraße 15 is a federal highway in Germany. It is located entirely within the state of Bavaria, runs in an almost perfect north-south direction, and runs from the A 9 north of Hof to the Inntal.


== History ==


=== Previous routes and names ===
Today's Bundesstraße 15 has its origins in the Reichsstraße 15. The Reichsstraßen were created in 1934 for the German Reich. The R 15 began in Gera and went through Schleiz, Hof, Wunsiedel and Marktredwitz to Mitterteich. From Mitterteich, it followed today's route to the connection to the Inntalautobahn near Rosenheim. From there, the R 15 went through Brannenburg and Oberaudorf to the border at Kiefersfelden. After the Anschluss in 1938, the R 15 was extended via Kufstein to Wörgl. In Kufstein, an auxiliary road, R 15a, branched off and went to the R 31 near Ellmau.
In 1941, the path of the R 15 north of Mitterteich was changed. Now, the R 15 began in the Bohemian town of Karlsbad and traveled through Falkenau (Sokolov), Eger (Cheb), and Waldsassen to Mitterteich and from then on, the same path as before. The part from Gera to Hof was given to the R 2, and the part from Hof to Mitterteich was given the designation of R 303.
After World War II, the path of the road was changed again. The B 15 now began in Hof and led over Selb and Marktredwitz to Mitterteich, and then south to the Austrian border as before. The part of the road between Eger and Mitterteich that was still within Germany became part of B 299.

Boeing XB-15

The Boeing XB-15 (Boeing 294) was a United States bomber aircraft designed in 1934 as a test for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) to see if it would be possible to build a heavy bomber with a 5,000 mi (8,000 km) range. For a year beginning in mid-1935 it was designated the XBLR-1. When it first flew in 1937, it was the most massive and voluminous aircraft ever built in the US. It set a number of load-to-altitude records for land-based aircraft, including carrying a 31,205 lb (14,154 kg) payload to 8,200 ft (2,500 m) on 30 July 1939.The aircraft's immense size allowed flight engineers to enter the wing through a crawlway and make minor repairs in flight. A 5,000 mi (8,000 km) flight took 33 hours at its 152 mph (245 km/h) cruising speed; the crew was made up of several shifts, and bunks allowed them to sleep when off duty.


== Design and development ==

The specification that produced the XB-15 began in mid-1933 as "Project A", USAAC discussions regarding the possibility of flying a very large bomber with a range of 5,000 mi (8,000 km). In April 1934 the USAAC contracted with Boeing and Martin to design a bomber capable of carrying 2,000 lb (910 kg) at 200 mph (320 km/h) over a distance of 5,000 miles. Boeing gave the project the internal name of Model 294, while the USAAC called it the XB-15. Martin's design, the XB-16, was judged inferior by the USAAC before a prototype was built, and was canceled.The Boeing design team, headed by Jack Kylstra, initially intended the aircraft to use 2,600 hp (1,900 kW) Allison V-3420 liquid-cooled W engines; since these were not ready, 850 hp (630 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1830 air-cooled radial engines were used instead.Starting in August 1934, Boeing began designing the Model 299 in answer to a proposal by the USAAC to replace the Martin B-10 bomber. The Model 299 design team incorporated elements of the Boeing 247 and the Model 294, especially its use of four engines. The Model 299 design team worked alongside Klystra's team, but difficulties in fabricating such a large aircraft slowed progress on the 294. The Model 299 flew first, on 28 July 1935.In mid-1935, the USAAC combined Project A with Project D; a proposal asking for "the maximum feasible range into the future." The combined program was designated BLR for "Bomber, Long Range". The XB-15 was renamed the XBLR-1; it was joined under the BLR program by two other projects: one from Douglas Aircraft, the XBLR-2 which later became the XB-19; and one from Sikorsky Aircraft called the XBLR-3, later canceled. The next year, the XBLR was dropped and the Boeing prototype was once again the XB-15.Unusual features that the XB-15 pioneered included an autopilot, deicing equipment, and two gasoline generators used as auxiliary power units (independent of the main engines) to power the 110-volt electrical system. The main engines were serviceable in flight using an access tunnel inside the wing. The aircraft contained a sizable crew compartment with bunkbeds, a galley and a lavatory. Finally, in September 1937 construction was finished, and on 15 October it first flew. Its double-wheel main landing gear remained down from takeoff to landing. On 2 December 1937, the XB-15 flew from Seattle to Wright Field in Ohio to be accepted by the USAAC for testing.With the Twin Wasp radial engines installed — the same number and type of engines fitted to the later Consolidated B-24 Liberator, with individual turbochargers added on the Liberators' Twin Wasp powerplants — the specified speed of 200 mph for the Twin Wasp-powered XB-15 was not quite reached even when the aircraft was empty; the best speed attained in level flight was 197 mph (317 km/h). Loaded with the specified 2,000 pounds, the maximum speed was a disappointing 145 mph (233 km/h). This was considered too slow for a combat aircraft, and the project was abandoned. However, Boeing engineers projected that the prototype would be capable of carrying the heaviest air cargo to date: a load of 8,000 lb (3,600 kg).The design challenges stemming from the great size of the XB-15 were difficult to master, but the lessons learned by Boeing were later applied to the Model 314 flying boat, which essentially used the XB-15's wing design with four of the more powerful Wright Twin Cyclone fourteen-cylinder radials for power. In 1938, the USAAC proposed to update the XB-15 to make the slightly larger Y1B-20, again using four Wright Twin Cyclones as with the Boeing 314, but the Secretary of War, Harry Hines Woodring, canceled the project before construction began, in favor of the expensive Douglas XB-19. Boeing went ahead with an internal redesign of the XB-15 called Model 316, a very heavy bomber with a high wing, a pressurized cabin and tricycle gear. The Model 316 was not built. The progression of design work starting with the XB-15 finally bore fruit with the Model 345 presented to the USAAC in May 1940, the very heavy bomber which resulted in the USAAF's Boeing B-29 Superfortress.


== Operational history ==

The single prototype was assigned to the 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, Virginia. Following the 24 January 1939 Chillán earthquake in Chile, the prototype flew a relief mission, carrying medical supplies. Commanded by Major Caleb V. Haynes, the aircraft carried 3,250 lb (1,470 kg) of American Red Cross emergency supplies to Santiago, making only two stops along the way, at France Field in the Panama Canal Zone, and at Lima, Peru. Haynes was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Order of the Merit of Chile, and the whole crew earned the MacKay Trophy.Haynes piloted the XB-15 again on 10 June 1939 to return home the body of Mexican flier Francisco Sarabia who had died in a crash in the Potomac River. After flying back from Mexico City, Haynes and his copilot William D. Old undertook flight tests at Fairfield, Ohio with heavy loads. The XB-15 lifted a 22,046 pounds (10,000 kg) payload to a height of 8,228 feet (2,508 m), and 31,164 pounds (14,136 kg) to 6,561.6 feet (2,000.0 m), setting two world records for landplanes. Haynes was awarded certificates issued by the National Aeronautics Association (NAA) for an international record for "the greatest payload carried to an altitude of 2,000 metres". The XB-15 was not fast for a bomber but it was the fastest aircraft that could carry so much weight, and for such distances. In July 1939 Haynes received certificates from the NAA for an international 5,000 km (3,100 mi) speed record with a 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) payload. The latter performance also established a national closed circuit distance record of 3,129.241 miles (5,036.025 km).Flying from Langley, the XB-15 arrived at Albrook Field in Panama on 10 April 1940 and immediately began classified bombing tests of canal lock protections, commanded by Haynes and including Captain Curtis LeMay as navigator and Lieutenant John B. Montgomery as bombardier. Of 150 bombs dropped, only three hit the target: a specially made bunker simulating a reinforced machine room. The few hits nevertheless led to improvements in bunker design. In early May, Haynes and LeMay made a survey flight from Panama over the Galapagos islands, the inspection including Baltra Island. Haynes piloted the XB-15 back to the United States, leaving Panama on 11 May 1940.In late 1940 the XB-15's defensive guns were removed at Duncan Field in Texas. Seats were attached so that Lend Lease aircraft ferry crews could be returned after delivery.


=== Cargo aircraft ===
On 6 May 1943 the Army Air Forces converted the only prototype into a transport, the aircraft being redesignated XC-105. A cargo hoist was mounted, and cargo doors fitted. Its maximum gross weight was increased to 92,000 lb (42,000 kg). By this time, the aircraft was nicknamed "Grandpappy" by 20th Troop Carrier Squadron airmen. It displayed nose art depicting an elephant carrying a large crate on its back labeled "supplies". During World War II, the XC-105 carried freight and personnel to and from Florida, and throughout the Caribbean, based out of Albrook Field beginning in June 1943. Hundreds of young women were flown in "Grandpappy" from Miami to the Canal Zone to engage in US government work; these trips were dubbed the "Georgia Peach Run". "Grandpappy" traveled to the Galapagos, landing on Baltra Island at the same airfield built following the XB-15 aerial survey of May 1940."Grandpappy"′s flight crew, reduced to six men, described the aircraft as difficult to fly and service. Two fires and a complete failure of the electrical system occurred in the air. The aircraft was retired on 18 December 1944, assigned to Panama Air Depot. In June 1945, it was ordered to be scrapped at Albrook Field in Panama, its engines and internal parts removed along with its vertical stabilizer and rudder. The remaining airframe was deposited at Diablo dump, a swampy landfill southwest of the runway, where it slowly sank from sight. Squatters built shacks on stilts in the swamp, covering the remains. The former dump is now an industrial area, with "Grandpappy" underneath.During its 18 months of transport service, the XC-105 carried more than 5,200 passengers, 440,000 lb (200,000 kg) of cargo and 94,000 lb (43,000 kg) of mail. It flew 70 cargo trips and 60 missions including anti-submarine patrol. Unusually, the aircraft was consistently referred to as "he" by its crew.

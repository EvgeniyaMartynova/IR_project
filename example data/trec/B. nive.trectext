Buddleja nivea

Buddleja nivea is a vigorous shrub endemic to western China, evergreen in the wild, but deciduous in cultivation in the UK. The plant was discovered by Wilson in the Yangtze basin at altitudes of 700 – 3,600 m.  Introduced to cultivation in 1901, it was named by Duthie in 1905. Several plants similar to the species but originally treated as species and varieties in their own right have now been sunk as B. nivea (see Synonyms).


== Description ==

Buddleja nivea reaches 1 – 3 m high, and is chiefly distinguished by the dense white indumentum covering the branchlets, calyxes, and undersides of the leaves. The lanceolate leaves are of variable size, 6 – 22  cm long by 1.5 – 11  cm wide; they are acute or acuminate at the apex, rounded at the base, and very coarsely toothed except at the apex. The insignificant, faintly-scented flowers have short corollas 6 – 8  mm long, with only the erect lobes visible above the indumentum. The flowers range in colour from pink to purple, and are arranged as narrow terminal panicles, < 25  cm long, appearing in summer. B.nivea is generally hexaploid (chromosome number 2n = 114), although plants identified as B.macrostachya may be hexaploid  or dodecaploid (2n=228).


== Cultivation ==
The species is fairly common in cultivation in the UK as it is hardy to - 15 C.. A large specimen is grown as part of the NCCPG National Collection held by Longstock Park Nursery near Stockbridge, Hampshire.
Hardiness: USDA zones 7–8.

Banksia nivea

Banksia nivea, commonly known as honeypot dryandra, is a shrub endemic to Western Australia. The Noongar peoples know the plant as Bulgalla. 
First described as Banksia nivea, it was transferred to Dryandra as Dryandra nivea by Robert Brown in 1810, and remained in that genus until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele.
The distribution range is forests, coastal plains and woodlands of the Southwest Botanical Province, extending to the east around Esperance and north to the Geraldton Sandplains, and most frequently recorded in Jarrah Forest and the Swan Coastal Plain. The species is associated with lateritic and granitic soil, with gravel or on sandy types, its habit is a very low shrub or obtaining a height of 1.5 metres.
This species was first collected by Jacques Labillardière in the vicinity of Esperance Bay between 15 and 17 December 1792, during a search for the naturalist Claude Riche, who had become lost on the Australian mainland. This was described and figured in Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse, his account of the voyage published in 1800, under the name Banksia nivea. In 1810 Robert Brown transferred it into a new genus, Dryandra, and it remained there until 2007 when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred all Dryandra species into Banksia.Species of nectarivorous birds that have been observed feeding on B. nivea include Acanthorhynchus superciliosus (Western Spinebill). Black Cockatoos have also been recorded feeding upon the seed, though it is not clear which species of black cockatoo was observed, Calyptorhynchus baudinii (Baudin's Black Cockatoo) or C. latirostris (Carnaby's Black Cockatoo).

A number of subspecies have been described,

Banksia nivea
Banksia nivea subsp. Morangup (M. Pieroni 94/2)
Banksia nivea subsp. nivea
Banksia nivea subsp. uliginosa (A.S.George) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele

Boehmeria nivea

Ramie (, RAY-mee) is a flowering plant in the nettle family Urticaceae, native to eastern Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial growing to 1.0–2.5 m (3 ft 3 in–8 ft 2 in) tall; the leaves are heart-shaped, 7–15 cm (2.8–5.9 in) long and 6–12 cm (2.4–4.7 in) broad, and white on the underside with dense, small hairs—this gives it a silvery appearance; unlike stinging nettles, the hairs do not sting. The true ramie or China grass is also called Chinese plant or white ramie.
A second type, known as green ramie or rhea, is believed to have originated in the Malay Peninsula.  It has smaller leaves which are green on the underside, and it appears to be better suited to tropical conditions. The word "ramie" is derived from the Malay word rami.


== Cultivation ==

Ramie is one of the oldest fiber crops, having been used for at least 6,000 years, and is principally used for fabric production. It is a bast fiber, and the fiber used for textiles comes from the inner bark (phloem) of the vegetative stalks and not the woody stem or outer bark. Ramie is normally harvested two to three times a year, but under good growing conditions can be harvested up to six times per year. Unlike other bast crops, ramie requires chemical processing to de-gum the fiber.
When the plant begins flowering, or just before, it signals both a decline in growth and the plant being at its maximum fibre content, and is harvested. Stems are harvested by cutting just above the lateral roots or by bending the stem. This enables the core to be broken and the cortex can be stripped from the plant in situ.After harvesting, stems are decorticated while the plants are fresh. If this is not done while the plants are still fresh, the plants dry out and the bark will be difficult to remove. The bark ribbon is then dried as quickly as possible, preventing bacteria and fungi from attacking it.The dry weight of harvested stem from crops ranges from 3.4 to 4.5 t/ha/year. A 4.5-ton crop yields 1,600 kg/ha/year of dry undegummed fiber. The weight loss during degumming can be up to 25%, giving a yield of degummed fiber of about 1,200 kg/ha/year.The fiber extraction occurs in three stages. First, the cortex (bark) is removed; this can be done manually or by machine. This process is called decortication. Second, the cortex is scraped to remove most of the outer bark, the parenchyma in the bast layer and some of the gums and pectins. Third, the residual cortex material is washed, dried, and degummed to extract the spinnable fiber.


== History ==

Ramie has been grown in China for many centuries, and farmers in ancient China are known to have used the fiber to weave clothing. It may have been used in cloth for wrapping mummies in Egypt. Though ramie and flax are difficult to distinguish in ancient cloth, ramie's resistance to bacteria and mildew would make it appropriate for mummy wrapping.Ramie was used to produce an open-weave fabric called mechera, used for shirts and dressing gowns suitable for warm climates. The French painter Raoul Dufy designed in the early 20th century patterns for prints on mechera used by the French shirtmaker Charvet.Brazil began production in the late 1930s with production peaking in 1971. Since then, production has steadily declined as a result of competition from alternative crops, such as soybeans and synthetic fibers.


== Properties ==
Ramie is one of the strongest natural fibers. It exhibits even greater strength when wet. Ramie fiber is known especially for its ability to hold shape, reduce wrinkling, and introduce a silky lustre to the fabric appearance. It is not as durable as other fibers, so is usually used as a blend with other fibers such as cotton or wool. It is similar to linen in absorbency, density, and microscopic appearance. It does not dye as well as cotton. Because of its high molecular crystallinity, ramie is stiff and brittle and will break if folded repeatedly in the same place; it lacks resiliency and is low in elasticity and elongation potential.


== Uses ==

Despite its strength, ramie has had limited acceptance for textile use. The fiber's extraction and cleaning are expensive, chiefly because of the several steps—involving scraping, pounding, heating, washing, or exposure to chemicals. Some or all are needed to separate the raw fiber from the adhesive gums or resins. Spinning the fiber is difficult due to its brittle quality and low elasticity; and weaving is complicated by the hairy surface of the yarn, resulting from lack of cohesion between the fibers. Greater utilization of ramie may depend upon development of improved processing methods and the need to find  plastic alternatives.Ramie is used to make such products as industrial sewing thread, packing materials, fishing nets, and filter cloths. It is also made into fabrics for household furnishings (upholstery, canvas) and clothing, frequently in blends with other textile fibers (for instance when used in a mixture with wool, shrinkage is reported to be greatly reduced when compared with pure wool). Shorter fibers and waste are used in paper manufacture. Ramie ribbon is used in fine bookbinding as a substitute for traditional linen tape.
For the 2010 Prius, Toyota began using a new range of plant-derived ecological bioplastics made from the cellulose in wood or grass instead of petroleum. One of the two principal crops used is ramie.
Ramie is also used as an ornamental plant in eastern Asia.
In Vietnam, ramie leaves are called "cây lá gai," which is a main ingredient in making "bánh gai" or "bánh ít lá gai," a Vietnamese glutinous rice cake. The leaves give the cake its distinct color, flavor and fragrance.
Ramie is also occasionally used in the construction of high performance rowing oar shafts. Mahe Drysdale used sculling oars made with ramie during the 2018 Rio Olympics where he won Gold in the Men's 1X Scull.


== Producers ==
China leads in the production of ramie and exports mainly to Japan and Europe. Other producers include Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Brazil. Only a small percentage of the ramie produced is available on the international market. Japan, Germany, France and the UK are the main importers, the remaining supply is used domestically.

Corridor B

The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) is part of the Appalachian Regional Commission in the United States.  It consists of a series of highway corridors in the Appalachia region of the eastern United States.  The routes are designed as local and regional routes for improving economic development in the historically isolated region.  It was established as part of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965, and has been repeatedly supplemented by various federal and state legislative and regulatory actions.  The system consists of a mixture of state, U.S., and Interstate routes.  The routes are formally designated as "corridors" and assigned a letter.  Signage of these corridors varies from place to place, but where signed are often done so with a distinctive blue-colored sign.
A 2019 study found that the construction of the ADHS led to economic net gains of $54 billion (approximately 0.4 percent of national income) and boosted incomes in the Appalachian region by reducing the costs of trade.


== History ==
  In 1964, the President's Appalachian Regional Commission (PARC) reported to Congress that economic growth in Appalachia would not be possible until the region's isolation had been overcome.  Because the cost of building highways through Appalachia's mountainous terrain was high, the region's local residents had never been served by adequate roads.  The existing network of narrow, winding, two-lane roads, snaking through narrow stream valleys or over mountaintops, was slow to drive, unsafe, and in many places worn out.  The nation's Interstate Highway System, though extensive through the region, was designed to serve cross-country traffic rather than local residents.The PARC report and the Appalachian governors placed top priority on a modern highway system as the key to economic development.  As a result, Congress authorized the construction of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) in the Appalachian Development Act of 1965.  The ADHS was designed to generate economic development in previously isolated areas, supplement the interstate system, and provide access to areas within the region as well as to markets in the rest of the nation.Currently, the ADHS is authorized at 3,090 miles (4,970 km), including 65 miles (105 km) added in January 2004 by Public Law 108-199.  By the end of FY 2018, 2,796 miles (4,500 km)—approximately 90.5 percent of the 3,090 miles (4,970 km) authorized—were complete, open to traffic, or under construction.  Many of the remaining miles will be among the most expensive to build.Corridor Z across southern Georgia is not part of the official system, but has been assigned by the Georgia Department of Transportation.


== List of ADHS corridors ==


=== Corridor A ===
Corridor A is a highway in the states of Georgia and North Carolina. It travels from Interstate 285 (I-285) north of Atlanta northeasterly to I-40 near Clyde, North Carolina. I-40 continues easterly past Asheville, where it meets I-26 and Corridor B.
In Georgia, Corridor A travels along the State Route 400 (SR 400) freeway from I-285 to the SR 141 interchange southwest of Cumming. From here to Nelson, near the north end of I-575, Corridor A has not been constructed; its proposed path is near that of the cancelled Northern Arc. It begins again with a short piece of SR 372, becoming SR 515 when it meets I-575. SR 515 is a four-lane divided highway all the way to Blairsville. From Blairsville to North Carolina, the corridor has not been built, and SR 515 is a two-lane road.The short North Carolina Highway 69 (NC 69) takes Corridor A north to U.S. Route 64 (US 64) near Hayesville. Corridor A turns east on US 64, and after some two-lane sections, it becomes a four-lane highway. Corridor A switches to US 23 near Franklin, and meets the east end of Corridor K near Sylva. From Sylva to its end at I-40 near Clyde, Corridor A uses the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which carries US 23 most of the way and US 74 for its entire length.


==== Corridor A-1 ====
Corridor A-1 uses US 19/SR 400 from the point that Corridor A leaves it, at SR 141 near Cumming, northeast to SR 53 near Bright. SR 400 continues northeast as a four-lane highway from SR 53 to SR 60 south of Dahlonega; this section was built "with APL funds as a local access road".


=== Corridor B ===
Corridor B is a highway in the states of North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. It generally follows U.S. Route 23 (US 23) from Interstate 26 (I-26) and I-40 near Asheville, North Carolina, north to Corridor C north of Portsmouth, Ohio.Corridor B uses I-240 from its south end into downtown Asheville, where it uses US 23 (current and future Interstate 26) to Kingsport, Tennessee. The US 23 freeway ends at the Tennessee–Virginia state line, but US 23 is a four-lane divided highway through Virginia and into northeastern Kentucky.At Grays Branch, Kentucky, Corridor B leaves US 23 to turn east on Kentucky Route 10 (KY 10) over the two-lane Jesse Stuart Memorial Bridge into Ohio. The short Ohio State Route 253 (OH 253) connects the bridge to US 52, a freeway that takes Corridor B north to Wheelersburg. US 52 continues west to Portsmouth, the proposed alignment of Corridor B continues north and northwest along Ohio State Route 823 to US 23 near Lucasville. The part of Corridor B north of SR 253 is also part of the I-73/74 North–South Corridor.


==== Corridor B-1 ====
Corridor B-1 travels from KY 10 to the north end of the Portsmouth Bypass. In Kentucky, it follows US 23 and US 23 Truck; after crossing the two-lane Carl Perkins Bridge into Ohio, it uses current and planned SR 852—a western bypass of Portsmouth—and US 23. Corridors B and B-1 both end near Lucasville, where Corridor C continues north along US 23 to Columbus.


=== Corridor C ===
Corridor C is a highway in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is part of U.S. Route 23 (US 23), traveling from the north end of Corridor B near Lucasville north to Interstate 270 (I-270) south of Columbus. As of 2005, most of the road is a four-lane divided highway, but there are a few gaps yet to be built. Corridor C is part of the I-73/I-74 North–South Corridor.


==== Corridor C-1 ====
Corridor C-1 is a connector from Corridor C near Chillicothe southeast to Corridor D near Jackson, Ohio, along US 35. It has been completed as a four-lane highway.


=== Corridor D ===

Corridor D travels east-west from Interstate 275 (I-275), near Cincinnati, Ohio, to I-79, near Bridgeport, West Virginia. The corridor utilizes Ohio State Route 32 (SR 32) and U.S. Route 50 (US 50).


=== Corridor E ===

Interstate 68 (I-68) is a 112.6-mile (181.2 km) Interstate highway in the U.S. states of West Virginia and Maryland, connecting I-79 in Morgantown to I-70 in Hancock. I-68 is also Corridor E of the Appalachian Development Highway System. From 1965 until the freeway's construction was completed in 1991, it was designated as U.S. Route 48 (US 48). In Maryland, the highway is known as the National Freeway, an homage to the historic National Road, which I-68 parallels between Keysers Ridge and Hancock. The freeway mainly spans rural areas, and crosses numerous mountain ridges along its route. A road cut constructed for it through Sideling Hill exposed geological features of the mountain and has become a tourist attraction.
US 219 and US 220 travel concurrently with I-68 in Garrett County and Cumberland, Maryland, respectively, and US 40 overlaps with the freeway from Keysers Ridge to the eastern end of the freeway at Hancock.
The construction of I-68 began in 1965 and lasted for about 25 years, being completed on August 2, 1991. While the road was being built, it was predicted that the completion of the road would improve the economic situation along the corridor. The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown and Cumberland, both with populations of fewer than 30,000 people. Despite the fact that the freeway serves no large metropolitan areas, I-68 provides a major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides an alternative to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for westbound traffic from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.

There have been several major planned road projects that would affect the freeway's corridor, which, due to major funding issues, are unlikely to be completed. These include a plan to extend I-68 to Moundsville, West Virginia, and the plan to link the Mon–Fayette Expressway, a toll highway which meets I-68 east of Morgantown, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.


=== Corridor F ===
Corridor F is a highway in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Kentucky. It travels from Interstate 75 (I-75) in Caryville, Tennessee, northeasterly to Corridor B (U.S. Route 23 (US 23)) near Kentucky. Corridor F uses US 25W and Tennessee State Route 63 (SR 63) from I-75 to Corridor S (US 25E) in Harrogate, Tennessee. There, it turns northwest along US 25E, passing through the Cumberland Gap Tunnel into Kentucky. It leaves US 25E in Pineville, Kentucky, turning northeasterly along US 119, past an intersection with Corridor I (Kentucky Route 15 (KY 15)) in Whitesburg, to its end at Corridor B.


=== Corridor G ===

Corridor G is a highway in the U.S. states of Kentucky and West Virginia that follows the route of U.S. Route 119 (US 119) from Pikeville, Kentucky, to Charleston, West Virginia. Construction on the road began in 1972 in West Virginia and 1974 in Kentucky, but it was more than two decades before the road was completed in either state. The full length of Corridor G in West Virginia was completed in 1997, but Kentucky's last segment was not opened until 2008.


=== Corridor H ===

Corridor H is a highway in the U.S. states of West Virginia and Virginia. It travels from Weston, West Virginia to Strasburg, Virginia. In December 1999, a settlement agreement was reached, providing the framework for resumption of final design, right-of-way acquisition and construction activities on the Corridor H highway project. Corridor H is the only corridor highway that remains incomplete in the State of West Virginia. It begins at I-79 in Weston and will end at I-81 in Strasburg when complete. Virginia's portion of Corridor H runs from the West Virginia state line to I-81 at Strasburg, Virginia. The building of Corridor H was controversial, arousing strong passions for and against. Decades of public debate and legal battles aired the essential question of whether previously isolated areas should be preserved or opened to development. Despite the controversy, about 75 percent of the highway had been completed as of 2013. The highway is open from the Weston exit of I-79 to Kerens, Randolph County and an additional section of the four-lane is open from the Grant -Tucker, County line to Wardensville as of July, 2016.


=== Corridor I ===
Corridor I is a highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It travels from Interstate 64 (I-64) southeasterly along the Mountain Parkway and Kentucky Route 15 (KY 15) to Corridor F (U.S. Route 119 (US 119)) in Whitesburg. Corridor I meets Corridor R (Mountain Parkway) near Campton and Hal Rogers Parkway and KY 80 in Hazard.


=== Corridor J ===
Corridor J is a highway in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Kentucky. It travels from the end of Interstate 24 (I-24) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, north to I-75 in London, Kentucky.Corridor J uses U.S. Route 27 (US 27) from Chattanooga north to Soddy-Daisy. There it turns northwest on State Route 111 (SR 111), eventually curving to the north via Dunlap, Sparta, and Cookeville to Livingston. Then it turns northwest on SR 52 to Celina and northeast on SR 53 to Kentucky.
Upon crossing into Kentucky, Corridor J becomes Kentucky Route 61 (KY 61), heading north to Burkesville. There it turns east on KY 90, which it follows to Burnside. Corridor J turns north on US 27 at Burnside, quickly turning northeast on KY 914 to bypass downtown Somerset and then east on KY 80 to London.
Listed in a US House of Representatives Report in 2002, was a proposed feasibility and the planning study to establish I-175 along Corridor J. However, no allocation of monies was appropriated and no additional discussion has been made since for this briefly proposed interstate along the corridor.
Until late 2005, Corridor J was to turn west just north of Cookeville along the planned SR 451 to SR 56 north of Baxter and then use SR 56 and SR 53 via Gainesboro.


==== Corridor J-1 ====
Corridor J-1 uses SR 56 and SR 53 from Algood to Celina, via Gainesboro; it is also proposed that the entire corridor be renumbered as SR 451.  The corridor serves as an alternate route for Corridor J, avoiding Livingston.  The entire route is two-lane with wide shoulders, allowing for possible expansion if needed.


=== Corridor K ===
Corridor K is a highway in the U.S. states of Tennessee and North Carolina.  Overlapped entirely by U.S. Route 74 (US 74), it also shorter concurrences with US 19, US 64, APD-40 (US 64 Bypass) US 129 and US 441.  The corridor connects Interstate 75 (I-75) in Cleveland, Tennessee (northeast of Chattanooga), easterly to Corridor A (US 23) near Dillsboro, North Carolina.

There are two gaps in the corridor, one in each state.  The 20.1-mile (32.3 km) gap in Tennessee is the Ocoee Scenic Byway along the Ocoee River from Parksville to Ducktown.  Plans outline a new alternate route for this section since the current route does not meet the purpose and need to support the regional transportation goals of a safe, reliable and efficient east-west route.  Currently in environmental study, a record of decision is expected in 2017.  The 27.1-mile (43.6 km) gap in North Carolina is located from Andrews to Stecoah.  Broken in three projects, the plan outlines a new four-lane expressway that will bypass north of the Nantahala Gorge and connect Robbinsville.  At a total cost to NCDOT estimated at $443 million, it is currently in reprioritization.
Since the corridor's establishment, the first major improvement for the corridor happened in 1979, when bypasses were completed for Murphy and Andrews.  In 1986, US 74 was extended west from Asheville, overlapping all of Corridor K.  Its last major improvement was in 2005, with the widening of NC 28 at Stecoah, first completed section Nantahala Gorge bypass.  Now at 74.8% of the corridor completed, it features four-lane divided highway predominantly expressway grade, with sections in and around Cleveland, Cherokee and Dillsboro at freeway grade.  The corridor also connects the cities of Ducktown and Bryson City, and features the Ocoee National Forest Scenic Byway, in Tennessee, and the Nantahala Byway, in North Carolina; treating travelers with grand vistas and various recreational activities.


=== Corridor L ===
Corridor L is a highway in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It follows the path of U.S. Route 19 (US 19) between Beckley and Sutton. By exiting onto Corridor L from Interstate 79 (I-79) at milepost 57, a southbound traveler can eliminate 40 miles (64 km), and $7.25 in tolls, re-entering the interstate system at the West Virginia Turnpike (I-64 and I-77) at milepost 48.
Originally, this corridor was built as a four-lane divided highway for only the portion south of US 60; however, the large amount of traffic (as part of the direct route from the cities of Toronto, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh to Florida and a considerable portion of the Atlantic southeast) forced the state to rethink this plan and upgrade the northern half to four lanes as well.


=== Corridor M ===
Corridor M is a highway in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It extends 200.1 miles (322.0 km) (including 29.9 miles (48.1 km) that are ineligible), with 102.1 miles (164.3 km) completed, from the I-70/I-76 interchange at New Stanton to an interchange with I-81 near the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Harrisburg, following PA Turnpike 66 and U.S. Route 22. The estimated cost to complete this corridor is $1.40 billion, including $42 million for prefinanced projects. The remaining work includes the construction of four lanes generally paralleling US 22 between Hollidaysburg and Lewistown.Projects currently under way in Pennsylvania include:
A location study on a 59.8-mile (96.2 km) section to provide four lanes between Hollidaysburg and Lewistown


=== Corridor N ===
Corridor N is a highway in the U.S. states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It is a designated portion of U.S. Route 219 (US 219), traveling from Corridor E (I-68/US 40) near Grantsville, Maryland, north to Corridor M (US 22 near Ebensburg, Pennsylvania). There is currently an attempt in the U.S. House of Representatives to extend this corridor, in the form of House bill H.R.1544 - Corridor N Extension Act of 2011. The act would extend Corridor N north from its current terminus at Corridor M to Corridor T in southwestern New York. The bill has not yet been brought before Congress for debate. As of January 2019, Corridor N has been completed as a controlled-access highway from just north of Ebensburg to Meyersdale. No portion of the route has been improved in Maryland.


=== Corridor O ===
Corridor O is a highway in the U.S. states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It is part of U.S. Route 220 (US 220), traveling from Corridor E, near Cumberland, Maryland, north to I-80, near Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. The part north of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70/I-76) near Bedford is also I-99.


==== Corridor O-1 ====
Corridor O-1 begins at Corridor O at Port Matilda, Pennsylvania, and travels northwesterly along US 322 to I-80 near Clearfield.


=== Corridor P ===
Corridor P is a highway in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It travels from a point near Mackeyville, eastward to Milton, via Williamsport.


==== Corridor P-1 ====

Corridor P-1 begins at Corridor M (US 22/US 322) near Duncannon and travels north for 51.01 miles (82.09 km) along US 11/US 15 and PA 147, meeting Corridor P at the interchange of Interstate 80 and I-180 near Milton.The majority of the corridor's length from its southern terminus to Selinsgrove is a four-lane divided highway carrying the US 11 and US 15 designations. The northernmost 3.79 miles (6.10 km) of this section is a freeway bypassing Selinsgrove. The next 10.84 miles (17.45 km) is an unbuilt freeway named the Central Susquehanna Valley Thruway (CSVT), which will partially be designated US 15 and PA 147. Construction began on the northern 4.49-mile (7.23 km) half of the CSVT in 2016. The remaining 7.49 miles (12.05 km) of Corridor P-1 from the CSVT to I-80 and Corridor P is a four-lane freeway section of PA 147.


=== Corridor Q ===

Corridor Q is a highway in the U.S. states of Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. It travels from US 23/US 119, near Pikeville, Kentucky, to Interstate 81, in Christiansburg, Virginia. In the 2013 fiscal year, the corridor is 82.2% completed.


=== Corridor R ===
Corridor R is a highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It travels from Corridor I at the interchange of the Mountain Parkway and Kentucky Route 15 (KY 15) near Campton east along the Mountain Parkway and KY 114 to Corridor B (US 23/US 460) in Prestonsburg. It forms part of a route from Lexington, Kentucky to Roanoke, Virginia using Interstate 64 (I-64), Corridor I, Corridor R, Corridor B, Corridor Q, and I-81.


=== Corridor S ===
Corridor S is a highway in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is routed entirely along U.S. Route 25E (US 25E); from Interstate 81 (I-81), near Morristown, to State Route 63 (SR 63; Corridor F), in Harrogate. In the 2013 fiscal year, 26.5 miles (42.6 km) has been completed, while 22.2 miles (35.7 km) remains to be constructed.


=== Corridor T ===

Corridor T is a highway in the U.S. states of Pennsylvania and New York. It travels from Greenfield Township, Pennsylvania (northwest of Erie) to Windsor, New York, and corresponds to Interstate 86, an upgrade of the existing New York State Route 17 (NY 17). An extension of the US 219 Southern Expressway will also join I-86.
Known as the Southern Tier Expressway and Quickway (split by Interstate 81 (I-81) at Binghamton, New York), I-86 will connect I-90 northeast of Erie, with I-87 (the New York State Thruway) near Harriman, New York. As of August 2008, it travels east from I-90 to NY 352 in Elmira, bringing the total length of highway designated as I-86 to 200 miles (322 km) (and 181 miles (291 km) remaining to be designated). Once completed, I-86 will stretch 388 miles (624 km) across the Southern Tier of New York from I-90 to I-87, shorter than the 460 miles (740 km) along the  New York State Thruway to the north.
Several sections of NY 17 are not up to freeway or Interstate Highway standards, and need to be upgraded before I-86 can be designated along its full length. These substandard sections are located near Elmira, Binghamton, and the Catskill Mountains.
I-86 currently travels 6.99 miles (11.25 km) in Pennsylvania and 190 miles (306 km) in New York. Except for a section of about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) that dips into Pennsylvania near Waverly, New York but is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation, the rest of I-86 will be in New York.


=== Corridor U ===
Corridor U is a highway in the U.S. states of Pennsylvania and New York. It begins at Corridor P (U.S. Route 220 (US 220)) near Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and proceeds generally northward to Corridor T (Interstate 86 (I-86)) in Elmira, New York. The corridor follows US 15 northward from Williamsport to Tioga Junction, where it turns northeastward to follow Pennsylvania Route 328 (PA 328), New York State Route 328 (NY 328), and New York State Route 14 (NY 14) through Elmira to I-86.The portion along US 15 in Pennsylvania is slated to become Interstate 99.


==== Corridor U-1 ====
Corridor U-1 is a spur from Corridor U at Tioga, Pennsylvania, continuing north along I-99/US 15 to Corning, New York, where it connects with Corridor T (I-86). Only the portion in New York is signed as I-99; the portion in Pennsylvania is slated to become I-99 but is currently only signed as US 15.


=== Corridor V ===
Corridor V is a highway in the U.S. states of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. Its termini are Interstate 55 (I-55) in Batesville, Mississippi, and I-24 west of Chattanooga, Tennessee.

As of late 2014, the following portions of Corridor V have been recently completed or are underway:

Between Red Bay, Alabama,  and Fulton, Mississippi (designated Mississippi Highway 76 (MS 76))
Relocated US 278/MS 6 between Tupelo and Pontotoc, Mississippi, which was opened in July 2014.Both sections of highway are currently under design by the Mississippi Department of Transportation, with the portion that will travel concurrently with MS 25 already under construction near Fulton.
A widening project is also underway on Alabama State Route 24 (SR 24) between Red Bay and Russellville, as this section of Corridor V was previously reconstructed as an improved two-lane route within divided a four-lane right-of-way.
Corridor V between Batesville and Fulton was also designated as National Highway System High Priority Corridor 42 and a Future Interstate Corridor as part of the 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century; originally, Corridor 42 also included a concurrency with Corridor X between Fulton and Birmingham, Alabama, but this concurrency was removed in subsequent legislation. However, the portion of the route between Batesville and Tupelo was only constructed to four-lane divided highway standards, making Interstate highway designation unlikely in the near future.
Corridor V was also designated as High Priority Corridor 11 in the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995.


=== Corridor W ===
Corridor W is a highway in the U.S. states of South Carolina and North Carolina. It is routed entirely along U.S. Route 25 (US 25); from Interstate 85 (I-85), in Greenville, South Carolina, to I-26, near East Flat Rock, North Carolina.  The entire corridor is four-lane, that is expressway grade in South Carolina and freeway grade in North Carolina.  Of the entire 39.4-mile (63.4 km) route, only 30.4-mile (48.9 km) was authorized for ADHS funding. In the 2013 fiscal year, both states completed their sections of Corridor W; South Carolina also became the first state to complete its entire ADHS miles of any of the 13 Appalachian states.


=== Corridor X ===

Corridor X is a highway in the U.S. states of Mississippi and Alabama. It travels from Fulton, Mississippi, to Interstate 65, in Birmingham, Alabama.


==== Corridor X-1 ====

Corridor X-1 or the Birmingham Northern Beltline is a proposed 65-mile (105 km) northern bypass around Birmingham, Alabama. Beginning at I-20/I-59/US-11 and I-459, south of Bessemer, Alabama, it will travel northwest connecting with I-22,  US 78,  I-65, then ending at I-59 north of I-459.

B roads in Great Britain

The Great Britain road numbering scheme is a numbering scheme used to classify and identify all roads in Great Britain. 
Each road is given a single letter, which represents the road's category, and a subsequent number, of 1 to 4 digits. Introduced to arrange funding allocations, the numbers soon became used on maps and as a method of navigation. Two sub-schemes exist: one for motorways, and another for non-motorway roads.
The scheme applies only to Great Britain (i.e. England, Scotland and Wales); similar systems are used in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey and British overseas territories. These other numbering schemes use similar  conventions.


== History ==
Work on classification began in 1913 by the government's Roads Board, with the aim of denoting the quality and usage of British roads. The work was interrupted by the First World War. It did not resume until the Ministry of Transport was formed in 1919 and given authority to classify highways and to allocate funding for road maintenance, authority for which was granted by section 17 (2) of the Ministry of Transport Act 1919. A classification system was created, under which important routes connecting large population centres, or for through traffic, were designated as Class I, and roads of lesser importance were designated as Class II. The definitive list of those roads was published on 1 April 1923, following consultations with local authorities. Government funding towards the repairs of these roads were set at 60% for the former and 50% for the latter.Shortly after this, the numbers started to appear in road atlases and on signs on the roads themselves, making them a tool for motorists in addition to their use for determining funding. The numbers of the roads changed quite frequently during the early years of the system, because it was a period of rapid expansion of the network and some numbered routes did not follow the most usual routes taken. The Trunk Roads Act 1936 gave the Ministry direct control of major routes and a new classification system was created to identify these routes. Originally, those numbers beginning in T were to be made public, but that was eventually deemed unnecessary.With the introduction of motorways in the late 1950s, a new classification of "M" was introduced. In many cases the motorways duplicated existing stretches of A road, which therefore lost much of their significance and were in some cases renumbered. There was no consistent approach to the renumbering – some A roads retained their existing number as non-primary roads (e.g. the A40 running alongside the M40), others were given "less significant" numbers (e.g. the A34 in Warwickshire became the A3400 after the M40 was built), and the remainder were downgraded to B or unclassified roads (e.g. the A38, which was replaced by the M5 between Tiverton and Exeter). Occasionally, the new motorway would take the name of the old A road rather than having its own number. The most notable example of that is the A1(M).


== Zoning system ==


=== Non-motorway ===
In England and Wales the road numbering system for all-purpose (i.e. non-motorway) roads is based on a radial pattern centred on London. In Scotland the same scheme is centred on Edinburgh. In both cases the main single-digit roads normally define the zone boundaries. The exception is between Zones 1 and 2, where the River Thames defines the boundary so that all of Kent is in Zone 2.
Zone 1: North of the Thames, east of the A1 covering Greater London, Essex, Cambridgeshire, East Anglia, Lincolnshire, parts of Yorkshire, Cleveland, Tyne and Wear, Northumberland, parts of the Scottish Borders, East Lothian and on up to Edinburgh
Zone 2: South of the Thames, east of the A3 covering part of Surrey, Sussex and Kent
Zone 3: North/West of the A3, south of the A4 covering part of Surrey, Hampshire (excluding Portsmouth), the Isle of Wight and South West England
Zone 4: North of the A4, south/west of the A5 covering the south and West Midlands, Oxfordshire, Bristol, Gloucestershire, Buckinghamshire and south, west and Mid Wales.
Zone 5: North/East of the A5, west of the A6, south of the Solway Firth/Eden Estuary covering North Wales, North Midlands, western Leicestershire, Cheshire, Cumbria and western Lancashire. In Central London, the A40 (Holborn Viaduct, Holborn, High Holborn and Oxford Street) provides a border between the 4 and 5 zones east of Marble Arch. The original A5 (now renumbered A5183) also provides such a border, and north of St Albans the original A6 (now renumbered A1081) provides an Eastern border.
Zone 6: East of the A6 and A7, west of the A1 covering eastern Lancashire, North East England, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, eastern Leicestershire and Rutland, and the Scottish Borders and Lothians. Between St Albans and Luton, the original A6 (now renumbered A1081) provides the Western border of the 6-zone.
Zone 7: North of the Solway Firth/Eden Estuary, west of the A7, south of the A8 covering Dumfries and Galloway, Ayrshire and Central Scotland, including Glasgow south of the Clyde.
Zone 8: North of the A8, west of the A9 covering northern Glasgow, Argyll and Bute, Highland and the Western Isles
Zone 9: North of the A8, east of the A9 covering Fife, North East Scotland, Orkney and ShetlandThe first digit in the number of any road should be the number of the furthest-anticlockwise zone entered by that road. For example, the A38 road, a trunk road running from Bodmin to Mansfield starts in Zone 3, and is therefore numbered with an A3x number, even though it passes through Zones 4 and 5 to end in Zone 6. Additionally, the A1 in Newcastle upon Tyne has moved twice. Originally along the Great North Road, it then moved to the Tyne Tunnel, causing some of the roads in Zone 1 to lie in Zone 6. The designated A1 later moved to the western bypass around the city, and roads between the two found themselves back in Zone 1. For the most part the roads affected retained their original numbers throughout.
Elsewhere when single-digit roads were bypassed, roads were often re-numbered in keeping with the original zone boundaries.In a limited number of cases road numbering does not necessarily follow the rules with some anomalously numbered.


=== Motorways ===

Motorways first came to Britain over three decades after the advent of the A-road numbering event, and as a result required a new numbering system. They were given an M prefix, and in England and Wales a numbering system of their own not coterminous with that of the A-road network, though based on the same principle of zones. Running clockwise from the M1 the zones were defined for Zones 1 to 4 based on the proposed M2, M3 and M4 motorways. The M5 and M6 numbers were reserved for the other two planned long distance motorways. The Preston Bypass, the UK's first motorway section, should have been numbered A6(M) under the scheme decided upon, but it was decided to keep the number M6 as had already been applied.  The first full length motorway in the UK was the M1 motorway.
Shorter motorways typically take their numbers from a parent motorway in contravention of the zone system, explaining the apparently anomalous numbers of the M48 and M49 motorways as spurs of the M4, and M271 and M275 motorways as those of the M27.
This numbering system was devised in 1958–59 by the then Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, and applied only in England and Wales. It was decided to reserve the numbers 7, 8 & 9 for Scotland. In Scotland, where roads were the responsibility of the Scottish Office (Scottish Government after 1999), the decision was taken to adopt a scheme whereby motorways took the numbers of the all-purpose routes they replaced. As a result, there is no M7 (as no motorway follows the A7), and when the A90 was re-routed to replace the A85 south of Perth, the short M85 became part of the M90.


== A roads ==


=== Single-digit A roads ===
In England and Wales, the six single-digit numbers reflect the traditionally most important radial routes coming out of London. Starting with the A1 which heads due north, numbers were allocated sequentially in a clockwise direction, thus:
A1 London to Edinburgh, (Also known as the Great North Road)
A2 London to Dover, (The southern part of Watling Street, also known as the Dover Road), however, the A2 beyond Rochester has been replaced by the M2.
A3 London to Portsmouth, (Also known as the Portsmouth Road)
A4 London to Avonmouth, (Also known as the Great West Road or the Bath Road), although this route is not used as a long distance road since the completion of the M4.
A5 London to Holyhead, (The Northern part of Watling Street)
A6 Luton to Carlisle (The A6 originally started in Barnet on the old A1. When the A1 was moved onto the Barnet Bypass in the 1950s, the A6 was cut back to the A1/A1(M) junction (later A1/M25 junction). Further renumbering in the St Albans area means that it now starts in Luton town centre. The old route is numbered as A1081).Similarly, in Scotland, important roads radiating from Edinburgh have single-digit numbers, thus:

A7 Edinburgh to Carlisle, although the M74 and M8 motorways now form the primary link.
A8 Edinburgh to Greenock, which formerly linked Edinburgh to Glasgow, however it now has a 25-mile gap, where it is replaced by the M8.
A9 Falkirk to Scrabster. Originally Edinburgh to Inverness, the A9 was extended to John o' Groats via Wick on 16 May 1935, and later cut back at the southern end because of the construction of the main runway at Edinburgh Airport on top of it. As such, the route from Edinburgh is now replaced by the M9 (with the M90 across the Queensferry Crossing as an alternative to Perth). On 1 April 1997, the A9 was diverted to Thurso and Scrabster at the northern end.While these routes remain the basis for the numbering of the A road network, they are no longer necessarily major roads, having been bypassed by motorways or other changes to the road network.


=== Other A roads ===
These radials are supplemented by two-digit codes which are routes that may be slightly less important, but may still be classified as trunk routes, although many of these routes have lost a lot of their significance due to motorway bypasses, or the upgrading of other A-roads. These routes are not all centred on London, but as far as possible follow the general principle that their number locates them radially clockwise from the associated single digit route. For example, the A10 (London to King's Lynn) is the first main route clockwise from the A1, the A11 (London to Norwich) is the next, then the A12 (London to Great Yarmouth) and the A13 (London to Shoeburyness); the next radial is the A2, followed by the A20 (London to Dover), and so on. These roads have been numbered either outwards from or clockwise around their respective hubs, depending on their alignment.The system continues to three and four digit numbers which further split and criss-cross the radials. Lower numbers originate closer to London than higher numbered ones. As roads have been improved since the scheme commenced, some roads with 3 or 4 digit numbers have increased in significance, for example the A127, A1079 and A414. New routes have also been allocated 3 or 4 digit numbers, for example the Edinburgh City Bypass is the A720.
The Major Road Network is a proposed classification of major local-authority controlled A roads that the government committed to implementing in 2017, with the aim of better targeting road funding.


=== Lists of A roads ===
Zone 1 A roads
Zone 2 A roads
Zone 3 A roads
Zone 4 A roads
Zone 5 A roads
Zone 6 A roads
Zone 7 A roads
Zone 8 A roads
Zone 9 A roads


=== Trunk roads and primary routes ===

Some A roads are designated trunk roads, which implies that central government rather than local government has responsibility for them. A more recent classification is that of primary routes, the category of recommended routes for long distance traffic. Primary routes include both trunk and non-trunk roads.


=== Motorway sections ===
Some sections of A roads have been improved to the same standard as motorways, but do not completely replace the existing road; they form a higher standard part of the route for those which are not excluded. These sections retain the same number but are suffixed with (M), for example the A1(M) and A404(M). There have been occasions where this designation has been used to indicate motorway bypasses of an existing road, but the original retains the A road designation, for example A3(M), A329(M), A38(M), A48(M) and A627(M).


== Other classifications ==
B roads are numbered distributor roads, which have lower traffic densities than the main trunk roads, or A roads.  This classification has nothing to do with the width or quality of the physical road, and B roads can range from dual carriageways to single track roads with passing places. B roads follow the same numbering scheme as A roads, but almost always have 3- and 4-digit designations. Many 3-digit B roads outside the London area are former A roads which have been downgraded owing to new road construction; others may link smaller settlements to A roads.


=== Lists of B roads ===

Zone 1 B roads
Zone 2 B roads
Zone 3 B roads
Zone 4 B roads
Zone 5 B roads
Zone 6 B roads
Zone 7 B roads
Zone 8 B roads
Zone 9 B roads


=== Minor roads ===
Roads and lanes with yet lower traffic densities are designated as unclassified roads commonly using C, D and U prefixes but, while these are numbered, in general this is done for use by the local authorities who are responsible for maintaining them and the non-unique numbering is in a local series which usually does not appear on road signs; use of local numbers on signs in England is "not advised". Exceptions to this are known however both in the form of numbers on signs and past use of prefixes H and V on signs in Milton Keynes where main roads have a regular grid system.  These designations are, however, used when planning officers deal with certain planning applications, including the creation of a new vehicular access onto a highway.
In London, Cycleways are designated and signed using the C prefix.

B roads in Great Britain

The Great Britain road numbering scheme is a numbering scheme used to classify and identify all roads in Great Britain. 
Each road is given a single letter, which represents the road's category, and a subsequent number, of 1 to 4 digits. Introduced to arrange funding allocations, the numbers soon became used on maps and as a method of navigation. Two sub-schemes exist: one for motorways, and another for non-motorway roads.
The scheme applies only to Great Britain (i.e. England, Scotland and Wales); similar systems are used in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey and British overseas territories. These other numbering schemes use similar  conventions.


== History ==
Work on classification began in 1913 by the government's Roads Board, with the aim of denoting the quality and usage of British roads. The work was interrupted by the First World War. It did not resume until the Ministry of Transport was formed in 1919 and given authority to classify highways and to allocate funding for road maintenance, authority for which was granted by section 17 (2) of the Ministry of Transport Act 1919. A classification system was created, under which important routes connecting large population centres, or for through traffic, were designated as Class I, and roads of lesser importance were designated as Class II. The definitive list of those roads was published on 1 April 1923, following consultations with local authorities. Government funding towards the repairs of these roads were set at 60% for the former and 50% for the latter.Shortly after this, the numbers started to appear in road atlases and on signs on the roads themselves, making them a tool for motorists in addition to their use for determining funding. The numbers of the roads changed quite frequently during the early years of the system, because it was a period of rapid expansion of the network and some numbered routes did not follow the most usual routes taken. The Trunk Roads Act 1936 gave the Ministry direct control of major routes and a new classification system was created to identify these routes. Originally, those numbers beginning in T were to be made public, but that was eventually deemed unnecessary.With the introduction of motorways in the late 1950s, a new classification of "M" was introduced. In many cases the motorways duplicated existing stretches of A road, which therefore lost much of their significance and were in some cases renumbered. There was no consistent approach to the renumbering – some A roads retained their existing number as non-primary roads (e.g. the A40 running alongside the M40), others were given "less significant" numbers (e.g. the A34 in Warwickshire became the A3400 after the M40 was built), and the remainder were downgraded to B or unclassified roads (e.g. the A38, which was replaced by the M5 between Tiverton and Exeter). Occasionally, the new motorway would take the name of the old A road rather than having its own number. The most notable example of that is the A1(M).


== Zoning system ==


=== Non-motorway ===
In England and Wales the road numbering system for all-purpose (i.e. non-motorway) roads is based on a radial pattern centred on London. In Scotland the same scheme is centred on Edinburgh. In both cases the main single-digit roads normally define the zone boundaries. The exception is between Zones 1 and 2, where the River Thames defines the boundary so that all of Kent is in Zone 2.
Zone 1: North of the Thames, east of the A1 covering Greater London, Essex, Cambridgeshire, East Anglia, Lincolnshire, parts of Yorkshire, Cleveland, Tyne and Wear, Northumberland, parts of the Scottish Borders, East Lothian and on up to Edinburgh
Zone 2: South of the Thames, east of the A3 covering part of Surrey, Sussex and Kent
Zone 3: North/West of the A3, south of the A4 covering part of Surrey, Hampshire (excluding Portsmouth), the Isle of Wight and South West England
Zone 4: North of the A4, south/west of the A5 covering the south and West Midlands, Oxfordshire, Bristol, Gloucestershire, Buckinghamshire and south, west and Mid Wales.
Zone 5: North/East of the A5, west of the A6, south of the Solway Firth/Eden Estuary covering North Wales, North Midlands, western Leicestershire, Cheshire, Cumbria and western Lancashire. In Central London, the A40 (Holborn Viaduct, Holborn, High Holborn and Oxford Street) provides a border between the 4 and 5 zones east of Marble Arch. The original A5 (now renumbered A5183) also provides such a border, and north of St Albans the original A6 (now renumbered A1081) provides an Eastern border.
Zone 6: East of the A6 and A7, west of the A1 covering eastern Lancashire, North East England, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, eastern Leicestershire and Rutland, and the Scottish Borders and Lothians. Between St Albans and Luton, the original A6 (now renumbered A1081) provides the Western border of the 6-zone.
Zone 7: North of the Solway Firth/Eden Estuary, west of the A7, south of the A8 covering Dumfries and Galloway, Ayrshire and Central Scotland, including Glasgow south of the Clyde.
Zone 8: North of the A8, west of the A9 covering northern Glasgow, Argyll and Bute, Highland and the Western Isles
Zone 9: North of the A8, east of the A9 covering Fife, North East Scotland, Orkney and ShetlandThe first digit in the number of any road should be the number of the furthest-anticlockwise zone entered by that road. For example, the A38 road, a trunk road running from Bodmin to Mansfield starts in Zone 3, and is therefore numbered with an A3x number, even though it passes through Zones 4 and 5 to end in Zone 6. Additionally, the A1 in Newcastle upon Tyne has moved twice. Originally along the Great North Road, it then moved to the Tyne Tunnel, causing some of the roads in Zone 1 to lie in Zone 6. The designated A1 later moved to the western bypass around the city, and roads between the two found themselves back in Zone 1. For the most part the roads affected retained their original numbers throughout.
Elsewhere when single-digit roads were bypassed, roads were often re-numbered in keeping with the original zone boundaries.In a limited number of cases road numbering does not necessarily follow the rules with some anomalously numbered.

B roads in Jamaica

The road network in Jamaica consists of almost 21,000 kilometres of roads, of which over 15,000 kilometres is paved. The numbering scheme used covers freeways, primary (or A) roads, secondary (or B) roads, parochial roads and unclassified roads.


== Motorways ==
Starting in the late 1990s the Jamaican Government (in cooperation with private investors) embarked on the Highway 2000 project to create a system of motorways, the first such access-controlled roads of their kind on the island. The project seeks ultimately to link the two main cities (Kingston and Montego Bay) and the north coast. It is being undertaken as a series of phases:
Phase 1a was the 33 kilometre Kingston-Bushy Park Highway (in actuality, from the Mandela Highway at Caymanas Park to Sandy Bay) which was completed in 2003, and the upgrade of the Portmore Causeway, completed June 2006.
Phase 1B  Sandy Bay to Four Paths which was completed on 15 August 2012 and opened as the T1 Toll Road. There is an exit for traffic to/from the A1 Spanish Town Bypass between 9.7km and 11.2km from the eastern end of the T1, then to Old Harbour at 26.5km, to Freetown at 30.9km, to Sandy Bay at 42.3km, and concludes at a junction with the A2 at 45km, about 400m east of the junction with Glenmuir Rd providing access to May Pen. Work on the section from Four Paths to Williamsfield has yet to start. This phase will be a total of 37.7 kilometres when completed.
Phase 2a Caymanas Park-Ocho Rios. The section from Linstead By-Pass to Moneague opened as the T3 on 5 August 2014, 19.1 km. The link to the A1 Moneague to Mount Diablo Road at 16.5km from Linstead remains closed at this time. This exit allows northbound traffic to exit to the A1 and southbound traffic to join the T3.
Phase 2b Mandeville-Montego Bay.On 2009-09-15 Jamaica's prime minister, Bruce Golding, announced to Parliament that Highway 2000 was to be renamed in honour of Usain Bolt. Those intentions were sidelined following a news paper article claiming Bolt had rejected the proposal.


== Northern Coastal Highway ==
1998, the Government of Jamaica and the European Commission signed the financing agreement for the third segment of the Northern Coastal Highway Improvement Project in the amount of €80 million. The Project involves the reconstruction and re-habilitation of approximately 96km of road between Ocho Rios; St. Ann; and Port Antonio, Portland. Total cost of the project is €105.0 million with the GOJ contributing €25 million for land acquisition and re-settlement as well as the construction of three bridges along the segment.
The entire project consists of approximately 287km of roadway and is divided into three segments.
· Segment 1 – Negril to Montego Bay (approx. 71km)
· Segment 2 – Montego Bay to Ocho Rios (approx. 97km)
· Segment 3 – Ocho Rios to Fair Prospect (approx. 119km)


== Southern Coastal Highway ==
Approval has been given by Cabinet for the execution of a contract between the government and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. for the design, improvement and construction of Sections 1A and 1B of the Southern Coastal Highway Improvement Project.  This will involve work from Harbour View to Morant Bay as part of the overall Segment from Harbour View to Port Antonio.
The existing main road along this southern coastal section of the island has been in generally poor condition. The alignment, surface condition, drainage are in need of major improvement.
The Harbour View to Morant Bay section covers some 43km, with Morant Bay to Port Antonio approximately 65km. The work on the Harbour View to Morant Bay leg is estimated to cost approximately US$385 million.
Among the improvement works will be a re alignment of the White Horses Bypass to the south of the town along the sea coast rather than to the north and modification of the Morant Bay Bypass at the western and eastern ends.
A section of the highway will also be constructed to accommodate four lanes and major structures are to be built including 16 bridges, one flyover, and one subway, along with new pipe and box culverts.
Financing for the project is through the China Exim Bank. It is being accommodated in the 5-year Public Sector Investment Programmes covering the period from 2016 to 2021.

List of County-Designated Highways in Michigan

The County-Designated Highways in Michigan comprise a 1,241.6-mile-long (1,998.2 km) system of primary county roads across the US state of Michigan. Unlike the State Trunkline Highway System, these highways have alphanumeric designations with letters that correspond to one of six lettered zones in the state. The CDH system was created in 1970 in response to the business concerns of a woman from Saugatuck. Her one-woman crusade in the 1960s started after the highway in front of her motel was turned over to local control as a county road and removed from state highway maps when the nearby freeway opened. After nearly a decade of efforts, the first two test highways were designated, one each in the Lower and Upper peninsulas of the state and included on the 1970 state highway map. The CDH system was created and expanded in scope c. October 5, 1970, after it was approved by the County Road Association of Michigan and the State Highway Commission.
The system uses eight lettered zones which are divided by major state highways. Each county road in the system is designated with the zone letter followed by a number. Six of the zones, A–F, are in the Lower Peninsula while the Upper Peninsula is divided into the remaining two, G and H. There have been a total of 66 different highways designated in seven of the zones; as of 2015 no E highways have been named. Participation by the county road commissions is optional, and not all counties use the system. One additional highway, H-16, has appeared on state maps since the 1980s although it is not a part of the system. Of the highways designated, two were removed from the system and later partially restored.


== History ==
When the Interstate 196 (I-196) freeway was built in the Saugatuck area in the 1960s, US Highway 31 (US 31) was shifted to the new freeway. The former route along Blue Star Highway was returned to county jurisdiction, which removed the various state highway markings from the roadway and displaced Blue Star Highway from the state highway maps of the time. At the time, Mr. and Mrs. Howard and "Gene" Temple owned a motel along the roadway in Saugatuck, and they were dismayed over the number of canceled reservations they were receiving because guests could not find their business. Mrs. Temple approached the Village of Saugatuck and the local chamber of commerce to get better highway markings for the area. She even contacted state legislators and members of the State Highway Commission. No changes were made, even though businesses along Blue Star Highway were suffering from a lack of traffic.

Mrs. Temple contacted officials at the Allegan County Road Commission and the County Road Association of Michigan in August 1968. State Senator Gary Byker of Hudsonville was also contacted, and he convened meetings with representatives on the state, county and local levels in search of a solution. These meetings resulted in a test program for the 1970 state highway map that marked Blue Star Highway as A-2; the Allegan County Road Commission spent $2,000 (equivalent to $10,200 in 2018) to erect about 50 markers along the road in their county. A second road in the Upper Peninsula was designated B-1 between Engadine and Rudyard in Mackinac and Chippewa counties. Both county roads on the state highway map contained the caption "Experimental Program for Identifying Key County Roads". The markers used were the blue and yellow pentagon shields developed by the National Association of County Engineers. Mrs. Temple earned an honor as the first woman in "Michigan to obtain a highway designation from the State Highway Commission".

The program was implemented by October 5, 1970, and expanded in scope. Instead of using designations beginning with an A for county roads in the Lower Peninsula and with a B for those in the Upper Peninsula, the system was divided into eight zones. The first of these revised assignments were shown on the 1971 state highway map; A-2 retained its number but B-1 was renumbered to H-40 in the Upper Peninsula. Earl Rogers, the engineer-director of the County Road Association of Michigan stated at the time that the county road commissions would gradually phase in signage over the coming years. Participation in the system was made optional, but all counties had agreed to the system. As of 2015, no counties in the E zone have assigned roads to the system, and many counties in the other zones have yet to participate. The system comprises 1,241.614 miles (1,998.184 km) of roadways.


== Zone system ==
As implemented in October 1970, the CDH system is divided into eight zones: six in the Lower Peninsula and two in the Upper Peninsula. This contrasts to the state highway system that makes no attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, numbers are assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd numbers and east–west highways have even numbers. Lower numbers are used to the south or west sides of the zones.

The Lower Peninsula is divided into six zones, A-F:

The A zone is bordered by I-96 on the north and US 127 on the east. The other two sides are formed by the southern state line with Indiana and Ohio and the western boundary along Lake Michigan.
The B zone is bordered by I-96 on the south, Lake Michigan on the west, US 10 on the north and US 127 on the east.
The C zone is bordered by US 10 on the south and both I-75 and US 127 on the east. The northwestern boundary is Lake Michigan and the Straits of Mackinac.
The D zone is bordered by US 127 on the west, I-96 on the north, the Detroit River and Lake Erie to the east and Ohio to the south.
The E zone is bordered by I-96 on the south, US 127 on the west, US 10 and Saginaw Bay on the north and Lake Huron on the east. As of 2015, no highways have been designated in the E zone.
The F Zone is bordered by both I-75 and US 127 on the west, Lake Huron on the north and east with US 10 on the south.The Upper Peninsula is divided into the G and H zones. The dividing line between the two zones is US 41, between Lakes Michigan and Superior with zone G to the west of US 41 and zone H to the east of it.

Roads in Northern Ireland

The main roads in Northern Ireland, which connect well with those in the south, are signed "M"/"A"/"B" as in Great Britain. Whereas the roads in Great Britain are numbered according to a zonal system, there is no available explanation for the allocation of road numbers in Northern Ireland, though their numbering is separate from the system in England, Scotland and Wales.
In Northern Ireland, Transport NI is responsible for all 5,592 miles (8,999 km) of roads. Road users also have the Highway Code for Northern Ireland, which provide guidance on the legal aspects of driving on Northern Ireland's roads.


== Motorways ==
The most important roads are motorways, designated by the letter "M". The motorway network is focused on Belfast. Legal authority for motorways existed in the Special Roads Act of 1963 similar to that in the Special Roads Act 1949 in Great Britain. The first motorway to open was the M1 motorway, though it did so under temporary powers until the Special Roads Act had been passed. Work on the motorways continued until the 1970s when the oil crisis and The Troubles both intervened causing the abandonment of many schemes. The M3 was the final motorway scheme in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom in its entirety to open.


== "A" roads ==

The next most important roads are designated with the prefix "A" and a one-, two- or three-digit number.


== "B" roads ==

Less important roads are indicated with the prefix "B" and a one-, two- or three- digit number.


== "C" roads ==
Minor roads can be indicated with the prefix "C" and a one-, two- or three- digit number, though it is very rare to see these marked on signposts or Ordnance Survey maps


== Euro Routes ==
The following Euro Routes include sections in Northern Ireland:

E01 – Larne – Belfast – Dublin – Rosslare – A Coruña – Pontevedra – Valença do Minho – Vila Real de Santo António – Huelva – Sevilla
E16 – Derry – Belfast ... Glasgow – Edinburgh ... Bergen – Arna – Voss ... Lærdal – Tyin – Fagernes – Hønefoss – Sandvika – Oslo
E18 – Craigavon – Belfast – Larne ... Stranraer – Gretna – Carlisle – Newcastle ... Kristiansand – Arendal – Porsgrunn – Larvik – Sandefjord – Horten – Drammen – Oslo – Askim – Karlstad – Örebro – Västerås – Stockholm/Kapellskär ... Mariehamn ... Turku/Naantali – Helsinki – Kotka – Vaalimaa – Vyborg – Saint Petersburg

B roads in Malaysia

Malaysian State Roads System (Malay: Sistem Laluan Negeri Malaysia) are the secondary roads in Malaysia. The construction of state roads in Malaysia is funded by Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) of each state. The standard of the state roads is similar with the federal roads except for the coding system, where the codes for state roads begin with state codes followed by route number, for example Johor State Route J32 is labeled as J32. If a state road crosses the state border, the state code will change, for example route B20 in Salak Tinggi, Selangor will change to N20 after crossing the border of Negeri Sembilan to Nilai.


== List of state codes in Malaysian State Roads system ==
The codes assigned to each state is the same as those of the car number plates except for Sabah.

A:  Perak
B:  Selangor
C:  Pahang
D:  Kelantan
J:  Johor
K:  Kedah
M:  Malacca
N:  Negeri Sembilan
P:  Penang
R:  Perlis
SA:  Sabah
T:  Terengganu
W :  Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur (not used)
Q:  Sarawak


== Municipal roads ==
Municipal roads are usually not given a route number, as they are maintained mainly by the local councils. An exception is some major roads in Shah Alam, the capital of Selangor. For example, Persiaran Raja Muda in Shah Alam was given route number BSA-3.

List of County-Designated Highways in Michigan

The County-Designated Highways in Michigan comprise a 1,241.6-mile-long (1,998.2 km) system of primary county roads across the US state of Michigan. Unlike the State Trunkline Highway System, these highways have alphanumeric designations with letters that correspond to one of six lettered zones in the state. The CDH system was created in 1970 in response to the business concerns of a woman from Saugatuck. Her one-woman crusade in the 1960s started after the highway in front of her motel was turned over to local control as a county road and removed from state highway maps when the nearby freeway opened. After nearly a decade of efforts, the first two test highways were designated, one each in the Lower and Upper peninsulas of the state and included on the 1970 state highway map. The CDH system was created and expanded in scope c. October 5, 1970, after it was approved by the County Road Association of Michigan and the State Highway Commission.
The system uses eight lettered zones which are divided by major state highways. Each county road in the system is designated with the zone letter followed by a number. Six of the zones, A–F, are in the Lower Peninsula while the Upper Peninsula is divided into the remaining two, G and H. There have been a total of 66 different highways designated in seven of the zones; as of 2015 no E highways have been named. Participation by the county road commissions is optional, and not all counties use the system. One additional highway, H-16, has appeared on state maps since the 1980s although it is not a part of the system. Of the highways designated, two were removed from the system and later partially restored.


== History ==
When the Interstate 196 (I-196) freeway was built in the Saugatuck area in the 1960s, US Highway 31 (US 31) was shifted to the new freeway. The former route along Blue Star Highway was returned to county jurisdiction, which removed the various state highway markings from the roadway and displaced Blue Star Highway from the state highway maps of the time. At the time, Mr. and Mrs. Howard and "Gene" Temple owned a motel along the roadway in Saugatuck, and they were dismayed over the number of canceled reservations they were receiving because guests could not find their business. Mrs. Temple approached the Village of Saugatuck and the local chamber of commerce to get better highway markings for the area. She even contacted state legislators and members of the State Highway Commission. No changes were made, even though businesses along Blue Star Highway were suffering from a lack of traffic.

Mrs. Temple contacted officials at the Allegan County Road Commission and the County Road Association of Michigan in August 1968. State Senator Gary Byker of Hudsonville was also contacted, and he convened meetings with representatives on the state, county and local levels in search of a solution. These meetings resulted in a test program for the 1970 state highway map that marked Blue Star Highway as A-2; the Allegan County Road Commission spent $2,000 (equivalent to $10,200 in 2018) to erect about 50 markers along the road in their county.

Roads in the Isle of Man

There are a number of transport services around the Isle of Man, mostly consisting of paved roads, public transport, rail services, sea ports and an airport.


== Roads ==

The island has a total of 688 miles (1,107 km) of public roads, all of which are paved. Roads are numbered using a numbering scheme similar to the numbering schemes of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; each road is assigned a letter, which represents the road's category, followed by a 1 or 2 digit number. A roads are the main roads of the island whilst roads labelled B, C, D or U decrease in size and/or quality. (The C, D and U numbers are not marked on most maps or on signposts.) There is no national speed limit - some roads may be driven at any speed which is safe and appropriate. Careless and dangerous driving laws still apply, so one may not drive at absolutely any speed, and there are local speed limits on many roads. Many unrestricted roads have frequent bends which even the most experienced driver cannot see round. Measured travel speeds (see table below) are often relatively low. Drivers are limited to 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) in the first full year after passing their driving test (Isle of Man citizens are permitted to start driving at the age of sixteen) and some are not used to having to make progress in the same way as on a larger road network such as that in the UK: even a cautious driver can get from anywhere in the island to anywhere else in no more than sixty minutes).
Set against this is a strong culture of motor sport enthusiasm (pinnacled in the TT, but there are many events during the year) and many residents familiar with the roads are well used to traversing country roads at speeds illegal on similar roads elsewhere. This leads to a very diverse spread of both driving competence and speed. In an official survey in 2006 the introduction of blanket speed limits was refused by the population, suggesting that a large number appreciate the freedom.
There is a comprehensive bus network, operated by Bus Vannin, a department of the Isle of Man Government, with most routes originating or terminating in Douglas.


== Railways ==

The island has a total of 68.5 km (42.6 mi) of railway. There are seven separate public rail or tram systems on the island:

aReduced in 2019 due to works on the promenade. These works have overrun badly, and as at October 2019 the situation with the horse trams in the 2020 season is uncertain.
(The last three are short-distance tourist rides which cannot be said to be transport services.)
All of these routes are seasonal.


== Airports ==
The only commercial airport on the island is the Isle of Man Airport at Ronaldsway. Scheduled services operate to and from various cities in the United Kingdom and Ireland, operated by several different airlines.The island's other paved runways are at Jurby and Andreas.  Jurby remains in Isle of Man Government ownership and is used for motorsport events and, previously, airshows, while Andreas is privately owned and used by a local glider club.  The old Hall Caine Airport, a grass field near Ramsey, is no longer used.


== Aircraft Register ==
The Isle of Man Aircraft Register became operational on 1 May 2007. The register is open to all non-commercial aircraft and is intended to be of particular interest to professionally flown corporate operators.
As of November 2012 a total of 537 corporate and private aircraft had been registered.


== Ports and harbours ==

There are ports at Castletown, Douglas, Peel, Port St Mary and Ramsey. Douglas is served by frequent ferries to/from England and occasional ferries to/from Ireland; the sole operator is the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, with exclusive use of the Isle of Man Sea Terminal and the Douglas port linkspans under the conditions of the user agreement with the Isle of Man Government.


== Merchant marine ==
The Isle of Man register comprised 404 merchant ships of 1,000 GT or over at the end of 2017.

Bundesstrasse

Bundesstraße (German for "federal highway"), abbreviated B, is the denotation for German and Austrian national highways.


== Germany ==

Germany's Bundesstraßen network has a total length of about 40,000 km.
German Bundesstraßen are labelled with rectangular yellow signs with black numerals, as opposed to the white-on-blue markers of the Autobahn controlled-access highways. Bundesstraßen, like autobahns, are maintained by the federal agency of the Transport Ministry. In the German highway system they rank below autobahns, but above the Landesstraßen and Kreisstraßen maintained by the federal states and the districts respectively. The numbering was implemented by law in 1932 and has overall been retained up to today, except for those roads located in the former eastern territories of Germany.

One distinguishing characteristic between German Bundesstraßen and Autobahnen is that there usually is a general 100 km/h (62 mph) speed limit on federal highways out of built-up areas, as opposed to the merely advisory speed limit (Richtgeschwindigkeit) of 130 km/h (83 mph) in unmarked sections of the autobahns. However, a number of Bundesstraßen have been extended as expressways (dual carriageways) (colloquially called "Yellow Autobahns"). Many of these have speed limits of usually 100–120 km/h, others have only an advisory speed limit like autobahns. Most sections of the federal highways are only single carriageway with one lane for each direction and no hard shoulder pull-out area.
The closest equivalent in the United States would be the U.S. highway system.


== Austria ==

In contrast to Germany, according to a 2002 amendment of the Austrian federal road act, Bundesstraßen is the official term referring only to autobahns (Bundesstraßen A) and limited-access roads (Schnellstraßen, Bundesstraßen S). The administration of all other former federal highways (Bundesstraßen B) has passed to the federal states (Bundesländer).
Therefore, officially classified as Landesstraßen, they are still colloquially called Bundesstraßen and have retained their "B" designation (except for Vorarlberg), followed by the number and a name. They are marked by a blue square sign with white number and are per se priority roads.
Before 2002 there has been a further category of Bundesstraßen with circular yellow sign and black number that shows that this road has no fixed priority (right of way for users). A few yellow signs lived longer than 2002.

B roads in Cyprus

Since the arrival of the first motor cars on the island in 1907, Cyprus has developed a modern road network. According to 2002 statistics, the road network in the Republic of Cyprus-administered areas of Cyprus consists of about 7,206 km of paved and 4,387 km of unpaved roads. Although the first motorway in Cyprus, A1, was completed as recently as October 1985, the country already has the most motorway km per capita (38.6 km /100,000 inhabitants) among all European Union members.
There are no toll paying roads in Cyprus to date.


== Maintenance ==
The Public Works Department of the Ministry of Communications and Works is responsible for the maintenance, improvement and construction of motorways, the majority of rural and interurban road network and the main urban roads.  The Municipalities are responsible for the secondary and local urban roads; the District Administration Authorities are responsible for the paved and unpaved district (tertiary) roads and village roads.  The Forestry Department is responsible for most unpaved roads in forest areas, this is in order to accommodate the administration and protection of forests.
The Turkish invasion of 1974 radically changed the program of road development and created new priorities in order to cover the augmented needs in the government controlled areas, where 80% of the Cyprus population and the greatest portion of development had concentrated.
Under these circumstances New Road Development Schemes were promoted, which were partially financed by foreign Financing Organizations.  Under these development projects new 4 lane motorways were constructed and more are on their way as follows:


== Cyprus motorways list ==

The highway network is continuously developed.  The first section of the A9 Nicosia - Astomeritis Motorway between Kokkinotrimithia and Akaki has been completed, whereas the rest is under study.  Also the upgrading of the Limassol Junctions and the A1 Nicosia - Limassol Motorway to a 6 lane road between the Strovolos Junction and Alampra Interchange are completed.
The following are under design:

Limassol Port connecting road. Construction began in 2012.
A7 Paphos - Polis Motorway is promoted through the D.B.F.O. method (Design, Build, Finance, Operate).Preliminary and feasibility studies are conducted for the:

Nicosia 3rd Ring road
A8 Limassol - Saittas Motorway
Astromeritis - Evrychou Motorway
Nicosia - Klirou Motorway


== Road network categories and numbering ==
Roads and Motorways in Cyprus can be classified into 5 main categories:

Motorways, 2 lanes per direction, free of any at-grade intersections. They are the most important road network on the island, and the letter "A" is used on their official numbering system. Motorways usually run parallel to the same-number "B class" intercity roads that they replaced and sometimes these roads are even transformed to Motorways (e.g. A3 Motorway and B3 road). While there is no formal announcement about the numbering of new motorways under construction and under planning, it's anticipated that they will have the same number as their current main road. So Limassol - Saittas Motorway will be coded A8 because A is the letter of Motorways and 8 because it will "replace" B8 road.
Main Roads, Intercity roads, mostly one lane per direction, except sometimes in residential areas up to two lanes. B is the letter used in their official numbering system, with a number up to two digits long. Most of them have been replaced with their same-number  Motorway (e.g. Traffic from Nicosia to Limassol now uses the A1 Motorway while in the past B1 road was the main connection between these cities)."B type" roads can be also main avenues within the city limits.
Roads, secondary road network, mostly connecting rural areas. One lane per direction, always paved. They use the letter "E" in their formal numbering system and they are 3 digits long. First digit is the serial number of the main road that the secondary road begins from (or the secondary road, that begins at another secondary road which begins at a main road etc.) and the last two digits is the serial number of the road. Smaller digits where the main road begins, larger ones near main road's ending.
Local roads, when coded during the 80's one lane and often dirt roads, today almost completely paved, and waiting for letter re - evaluation. They use "F" in the official coding system, and they are counted in the same way as "E"s are. There is no "E" with the same number as an "F".
Unclassified roads. They can be "B" and "E" type. The case here is that these roads were constructed after the road network was numbered, so they will remain without a serial number and road signs will remain with gaps until the next road numbering evaluation.

B roads in Australia

Highways in Australia are generally high capacity roads managed by state and territory government agencies, though Australia's federal government contributes funding for important links between capital cities and major regional centres. Prior to European settlement, the earliest needs for trade and travel were met by narrow bush tracks, used by tribes of Indigenous Australians. The formal construction of roads began in 1788, after the founding of the colony of New South Wales, and a network of three major roads across the colony emerged by the 1820s. Similar road networks were established in the other colonies of Australia. Road construction programs in the early 19th century were generally underfunded, as they were dependent on government budgets, loans, and tolls; while there was a huge increase in road usage, due to the Australian gold rushes. Local government authorities, often known as Road Boards, were therefore established to be primarily responsible for funding and undertaking road construction and maintenance. The early 1900s saw both the increasingly widespread use of motorised transportation, and the creation of state road authorities in each state, between 1913 and 1926. These authorities managed each state's road network, with the main arterial roads controlled and maintained by the state, and other roads remaining the responsibility of local governments. The federal government became involved in road funding in the 1920s, distributing funding to the states. The depression of the 1930s slowed the funding and development of the major road network until the onset on World War II. Supply roads leading to the north of the country were considered vital, resulting in the construction of Barkly, Stuart, and Eyre Highways.
The decades following the war saw substantial improvements to the network, with freeways established in cities, many major highways sealed, development of roads in northern Queensland and Western Australia under the Beef Cattle Roads Grants Acts, and interstate routes between Sydney and Melbourne upgraded. In 1974, the federal government assumed responsibility for funding the nations most important road links, between state and territory capitals cities, which were declared National Highways. Some sections of the 16,000-kilometre-long (9,900 mi) National Highway system were no more than dirt tracks, while others were four lane dual carriageways. The network was gradually improved, and by 1989, all gravel road sections had been sealed. In the following decades, the National Highway system was amended through legislation, and was eventually superseded in 2005 by the broader National Land Transport Network, which included connections to major commercial centres, and intermodal freight transport facilities.
The first route marking system was introduced in the 1950s by the Conference of State Road Authorities, which later became the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities (NAASRA) and then Austroads. National Routes were assigned to significant interstate routes "which, both now and in the future, comprise the more important arteries of road communications throughout Australia in all its aspects". East-west routes were planned to have even numbers, increasing from south to north, while north-south routes would have odd numbers, with numbers increasing from east to west. National Route 1 would be an exception, as a "circumferential route along the coastline of Australia". A state route marking systems was designed to supplement the national system, for inter-regional and urban routes within states. Each state could choose their own numbering scheme, as long as National Route and State Route numbers weren't duplicated in the same state, or nearby routes in another state.  When the National Highway system was introduced, National Routes along it became National Highway routes with the same numbers, but with distinctive green and gold route markers. During the 1990s, planning began for a new alphanumeric route system. Alphanumeric routes have been introduced in most states and territories in Australia, partially or completely replacing the previous systems.


== History ==
The earliest needs for trade and travel were met by narrow bush tracks, used by tribes of Indigenous Australian prior to European settlement. The formal construction of roads began in 1788, after the founding of the colony of New South Wales. These roads were little more than cleared paths, constructed without grading, drainage systems, and road surfaces. There was no system wide planning for roads, with the Surveyor-General's 1788 proposed town plan dismissed as being too ostentatious; however, the arrival of Governor Macquarie in 1810 lead to a planned system for roads and bridges, prior to actual settlement of areas, financed from government funds, public subscription, and tolls. By the end of his term in 1822 the colony had a network of three major roads, with the Great Western Road as the most important link, traversing the Blue Mountains from Sydney to Bathurst. Similar road networks were established in the other colonies of Australia.Road construction programs in the early 19th century were generally underfunded, as they were dependent on government budgets, loans, tolls and public subscription. This problem was exacerbated by the huge increase in road usage, due to the Australian gold rushes. Local government authorities were therefore established as authorities primarily responsible for funding and undertaking road construction and maintenance. The increasing amount of motorised transportation in the early 1900s lead to another major increase in traffic levels. The vehicles also required higher standard of roads. State road authorities were established in each state between 1913 and 1926. These authorities managed each state's road network, with the main arterial roads controlled and maintained by the state, and other roads remaining the responsibility of local governments. Though legislation differed in each state, highways were generally established as a subset of state controlled roads, which were the most important links between major cities, towns, and regional centres.
The federal government became involved in road funding in the 1920s. The Public Works Act was passed in 1922, which distributed $500,000 to the states according to population levels, conditional on states matching funding on a "dollar for dollar basis". The funds were specifically aimed at maintenance of roads outside of metropolitan cities, and state expenditure needed federal government approval; however, the primary purpose of the act was to reduce unemployment.
The Main Roads Development Act of 1923 made $1 million available for road construction, and specific road projects were funded under the Federal Aid Roads Act of 1926. The 1931 Federal Aid Roads Act removed matching conditions, and were less restrictive on the way the money was used due to poor economic conditions resulting from the depression of the 1930s. Funding conditions remained at this lower level until 1959.The depression of the 1930s slowed the funding and development of the major road network until the onset on World War II. Supply roads leading to the north of the country were considered vital, leading to the construction of Barkly, Stuart, and Eyre highways. Over 960 kilometres of the Stuart Highway, from Tennant Creek to Darwin, was upgraded from an often impassable track to an all-weather sealed highway that could cope with heavy military traffic. The Eyre Highway across the Nullarbor was formed just by grading the surface material.The decades following the war saw substantial improvements to the network, with freeways established in cities, many major highways sealed, development of roads in northern Queensland and Western Australia under the Beef Cattle Roads Grants Acts. The interstate routes between Sydney and Melbourne were upgraded with the first four lane dual carriageway section of the Hume Highway opening in 1961, and the completed sealing of the Princes Highway between the cities in 1966. Large mining developments in the Pilbara region of Western Australia were undertaken lead to the improvement of the North West Coastal Highway from Carnarvon to Port Hedland, a project that involved building 30 bridges in a decade.In 1974, the federal government assumed responsibility for funding the nations most important road links. Under the National Roads Act 1974, the most important roads between state and territory capitals cities were declared National Highways. The federal government fully funded construction and maintenance works undertaken by the states on these roads. The 16,000 kilometres (9,900 mi) of roads included in the original National Highway system varied greatly in quality. Some sections were no more than dirt tracks, whilst others were four lane dual carriageways. While 12,496 kilometres (7,765 mi) was sealed, there was also 3,807 kilometres (2,366 mi) of gravel roads. The National Highway was gradually improved, with the sealed proportion increased from 73 per cent in the early 1970s to 88 per cent by 1981. The sealing works were completed in 1989.In 1988, the National Highway became redefined under the Australian Land Transport Development (ALTD) Act of 1988, which had various amendments up to 2003. The 1988 Act also defined a category of "Road of National Importance", which were partly funded by federal government.
The Introduction of the AusLink (National Land Transport) Act in 2005 superseded the National Highway and Roads of National Importance classifications, which were replaced by the National Land Transport Network. The criteria for inclusion in the network was similar to the previous legislation, but expanded to include connections to major commercial centres, and inter-modal freight transport facilities. All of the roads included in National Land Transport Network as of 2005 were formally defined by regulation in October 2005. Auslink has since been replaced with subsequent legislation under the federal government's Nation Building Program, which includes the National Land Transport Network. The National Highways road routes developed under the former system are still designated as National Highways on route markers and road guidance signs. However, the new alphanumeric route numbering system introduced to New South Wales and the ACT in 2013 does not distinguish between the former National Highways and other routes. VicRoads have, as of September 2013, similarly deprecated the National Highway route marker in favour of standard routes.


== Route numbering systems ==
Roads routes in Australia assist drivers navigating roads throughout the country, by identifying important through-routes. The first route marking system was introduced to Australia in the 1950s. National Routes were assigned to significant interstate routes – the most important road links in the country. National Route 1 was designated to a circular route around the Australian coastline. A state route marking system was designed to supplement the national system, for inter-regional and urban routes within states. When the National Highway system was introduced, National Routes along it became National Highway routes with the same numbers, but with distinctive green and gold route markers. Alphanumeric routes were introduced in Tasmania in 1979, and during the 1990s, planning began for nationally consistent route markings, using the alphanumeric system. Alphanumeric routes have been introduced in most states and territories in Australia, partially or completely replacing the previous systems.
* New South Wales used to use this system before becoming completely plain alphanumeric. Queensland technically uses this system but most of these roads have been replaced by M roads by a similar move (The remaining ones are kept basically because the state still uses State Routes).


=== National Routes and Highways ===

In 1955, the Australian National Route Numbering System was introduced to simplify navigation across Australia. The National Route Numbers are marked by white shields that are present in directional signs, distance signs or trailblazers. The general rule was that odd-numbered highways travel in north-south directions and even-numbered highways in east-west directions, with only a few exceptions. National Route 1 was assigned to a network of highways and roads, which together linked all capital cities and coastal towns circumnavigating the mainland. The National Route system initially linked the centres of towns and cities and terminated at the junction of other national routes, however many bypasses have been constructed since then. National Routes often terminated at the metropolitan city limits rather than the individual city centres.In 1974, the federal government assumed responsibility for funding the nations most important road links, with the introduction of the National Highway. These highways were marked with distinctive green and gold route marker shields instead of the plain National Route shield. Though the National Highway system has been superseded in subsequent legislation, National Highway route markers are still used on many of the routes. Additionally, National Highways and National Routes have been phased out, or are in the process of being phased out, in all states and territories except Western Australia, in favour of the alphanumeric system.


=== State Routes ===
Important urban and inter-regional routes not covered by the National Highway or National Route systems are marked under the State Route system. They can be recognised by blue shield markers. They were practically adopted in all states by the end of the 1980s, and in some states, some less important National Routes were downgraded to State Routes. Each state has or had its own numbering scheme, but do not duplicate National Route numbers in the same state, or nearby routes in another state.
As with the National Routes and National Highways, State Routes are being phased out in most states and territories in favour of alphanumeric routes. However, despite the fact that Victoria has fully adopted alphanumeric routes in regional areas, state route numbers are still used extensively within the city of Melbourne as a part of its Metropolitan Route Numbering Scheme.


=== Metroads ===

In the 1990s in Sydney and Brisbane, urban route numbering system were streamlined under the Metroad scheme. Metroad route numbers were assigned to the key navigational corridors, along ring and radial routes, and marked by distinctive hexagonal shields. Most Metroads have been partially replaced with alphanumeric routes in Brisbane, and they have been completely replaced in Sydney.


=== Alphanumeric routes ===

Tasmania introduced an alphanumeric route numbering system in 1979, based on the British system from 1963. The new system aimed to upgrade the signing of destinations, including previously unmarked roads, and to simplify navigation by allowing visitors to follow numbered routes. National Highway 1 was retained as the only route without an alphanumeric designation.
In the 1990s Victoria and South Australia also overhauled their systems. While South Australia discarded the National and State Route Numbering Systems, those shield-based schemes were retained in the Melbourne metropolitan area as the Metropolitan Route Numbering Scheme. The route numbers used in the alphanumeric schemes were generally inherited from the original National Route Numbering System, with only a few exceptions, and prefixed with letters denoting their grade. For example, Western Freeway is M8 until Ballarat and continues beyond as A8 Western Highway. They are not used extensively in the Melbourne metropolitan area where the blue-shield metropolitan route system is retained for most routes. The National Highways were retained, until 2013, but with the route numbers changed to alphanumeric designations.
New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory introduced the alphanumeric system from early 2013. Before being officially announced, new road signs were fitted with such numbers and then being "coverplated" with the existing route number. However, the new system does not distinguish between the former National Highways and other routes.
Alphanumeric routes have also been introduced for many major highways and urban routes in Queensland, although many other roads retain markers from the National Route, National Highway, State and Metroad numbering systems. According to the New South Wales Roads and Maritime Services, the Northern Territory has similarly begun converting their numbered routes to alphanumeric routes, with a "progressive replacement" scheme that sees alphanumeric route markers introduced only when signs are replaced. There are no plans to introduce an alphanumeric route numbering system in Western Australia.


==== Prefix letters ====
In the alphanumeric systems, a letter denoting the route's construction standard and function is prefixed to the route number, creating an alphanumeric route designation. One of four letters may be used:

"M" routes are primary traffic routes, called motorways in some states. These are typically dual carriageway, freeway-standard highways, but may also be used for rural roads that are nearly at freeway-standard, or at least are dual carriageways.
"A" routes are other primary highways, including urban arterials and interstate or interregional single carriageways.
"B" routes are less significant routes, either as an alternative to an "A" or "M" route, or linking smaller population centres to larger regional centres, but without being a major through-route in the region. These are the major road links in areas without "A" routes.
"C" routes link smaller settlements and towns to the rest of the major road network. They are used for roads without the significance of an "M", "A", or "B" route, but where numbering would assist navigation.


== Classification ==
Australia's major roads are managed by the states and territories. While some state road authorities use a road hierarchy with Highway as the highest classification, the classification of state-controlled roads varies between states, with differing classification names, definitions, and number of levels in the hierarchy. Road names do not necessarily correspond to classifications – for example, Great Southern Highway is not classified as a highway. A highway, or other classification level, may be composed of multiple named roads, and a single road name may have varying classifications along its length. Internal numbering schemes for such classifications do not necessarily relate to designated road routes – for example, Great Western Highway is Highway 5 for administrative purposes but is signposted as part of route A32.


=== Australian Capital Territory ===
The ACT classifies its roads into four groups, depending on its physical properties and role within the road network:
Arterial roads: These roads serve long distance travellers within or between districts, and support large volumes of traffic. They may be limited access, or controlled-access. A small number of these roads have relatively high levels of property access due to city design requirements at the time.
Major collector roads: These roads serve local area traffic distributing to or from minor collector roads, and also link to the arterial network. Well designed property access is permissible.
Minor collector roads: These roads serve neighbourhood traffic, and provide access from the major collector roads into residential areas. Normal direct property access is permissible at this level. Secondary links to the arterial network are possible.
Access streets: These streets are the lowest road type in the hierarchy, and provide access to the bulk of residential homes.


=== New South Wales ===
In New South Wales, sections 46, 47, 50 and 51 of the Roads Act 1993 provide for the classifications of Highway, Main Road, Secondary Road or Tourist Road.


=== Northern Territory ===
In the Northern Territory, major roads are classified into three categories: National Highway, Arterial Roads, and Secondary Roads.


=== Queensland ===
In Queensland, roads are classified as: National Network, State Strategic Roads, Regional Roads, or District Roads.


=== South Australia ===
South Australia's Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (DPTI) classifies state-controlled roads into three categories: National Land Transport Network; DPTI Maintained Road, Sealed; and DPTI Maintained Road, Unsealed.


=== Tasmania ===
In Tasmania, the most important state and regional connections, totalling 3,650 kilometres (2,270 mi), are state-owned roads, which are further classified into a road hierarchy.
The hierarchy consists of:

Trunk roads – major highways which are the "primary freight and passenger roads"
Regional freight roads – regional roads which connect heavy freight to the trunk roads
Regional access roads – providing access to Tasmania’s Regions, with less traffic than trunk and regional freight roads
Feeder roads – connect population centres and tourist traffic to and from the rest of the state road network
Other roads – lower traffic roads, primarily providing access to private properties


=== Victoria ===
In Victoria, major roads are designated as either freeways (including tollways) or arterial roads (including other tolled roads), under section 17 subsection 1 of the Road Management Act 2004, and under the same act, section 14 subsection 1, VicRoads is named as the controlling authority in designating major roads as either freeways or arterial roads.


=== Western Australia ===
In Western Australia, roads controlled and maintained by the state road authority, Main Roads Western Australia, are either highways or Main Roads. Any road or section of road may be proclaimed a highway by the Governor of Western Australia, on the recommendation of the Commissioner of Main Roads, under Section 13 of the Main Roads Act 1930. Section 14 of the act allows for the creation of new highways.
As well as this legal classification scheme, Main Roads Western Australia also classifies roads by the following functional hierarchy:
Primary Distributor: Provide for major regional and inter-regional traffic movement and carry large volumes of generally fast moving traffic. They are managed by Main Roads Western Australia.
Regional Distributor: Roads that are not primary distributors, but which link significant destinations and are designed for efficient movement of people and goods within and beyond regional areas. They are managed by local government.
District Distributor: Roads that run between built up area land-use cells and generally not through them, forming a grid which would ideally space them about 1.5 kilometres apart. They are managed by local government.
Local Distributor: Roads that carry traffic within a cell and link district distributors or primary distributors at the boundary, to access roads. The route of local distributors should discourage through traffic so that the cell formed by the grid of higher order distributor roads, only carries traffic belonging to, or serving the area. In rural areas local distributors connect to other rural distributors and to rural access roads.
Access Road: Provide access to abutting properties with safety aspects having priority over the vehicle movement function. In urban areas, these roads are bicycle and pedestrian friendly, with aesthetics and amenity also important. Access roads are managed by local government.Other classifications processes exist for planning, administrative, financial, and asset management purposes.


== Federally funded highways ==
The federal government contributes funding for the following road links, which make up the national road network, under the Nation Building Program.
Sydney to Melbourne – Hume Highway/Freeway/Motorway
Sydney to Brisbane – the Pacific Motorway (Sydney–Newcastle), New England and Cunningham Highways route and the Pacific Highway route
Brisbane to Cairns – Bruce Highway
Brisbane to Darwin – Warrego, Landsborough, Barkly and Stuart Highways
Brisbane to Melbourne – Warrego, Gore, Newell and Goulburn Valley Highways and Hume Freeway
Melbourne to Adelaide – Western Highway/Freeway, Dukes Highway and South Eastern Freeway
Adelaide to Darwin – Port Wakefield Road, Augusta Highway and Stuart Highway
Adelaide to Sydney – Sturt and Hume Highway/Motorway
Adelaide to Perth – Port Wakefield Road, Augusta, Eyre, Coolgardie-Esperance (part) and Great Eastern Highways
Perth to Darwin – Great Northern, Victoria and Stuart Highways
Sydney to Canberra – Hume Highway/Motorway and Federal Highways
Melbourne to Canberra – Hume Highway/Freeway and Barton Highways
Hobart to Burnie including the link from Launceston to Bell Bay – Brooker, Midlands and the Bass Highway
Townsville to Mount Isa – Flinders Highway
Melbourne to Sale – Princes Highway
Perth to Bunbury – South Western Highway
Melbourne to Mildura – Calder Highway/Freeway
Sydney to Dubbo – Great Western and Mitchell Highways
Sydney to Wollongong – Princes Motorway and Princes Highway
Melbourne to Geelong – Princes Highway

B roads in Kenya

Transport in Kenya refers to the transportation structure in Kenya. The country has an extensive network of paved and unpaved roads.
Kenya's railway system links the nation's ports and major cities and connects Kenya with neighbouring Uganda. There are 15 airports with paved runways.


== Roads ==
According to the Kenya Roads Board, Kenya has 160,886 kilometres (99,970 mi) of roads. 13,900 kilometres (8,600 mi) of this are paved.


=== Classification ===
They are currently classified into the following categories:


=== Bus Transport ===

There are around 100,000 matatus (minibuses), which constitute the bulk of the country's public transport system.
Once the largest bus company in Kenya, Kenya Bus Services, ran into financial difficulties, forcing them to reduce the number of buses operated. They are currently operating minibuses within Nairobi city, although new, smaller, city buses offering passengers higher standards of comfort and safety have been introduced on some inner-city routes.
Coast Bus, the oldest bus operator in Kenya, runs a day and night service between Nairobi and the coastal city of Mombasa. Ascott operates minivans offering shuttle service between Nairobi and Kisii; they offer snacks on board. The Guardian bus co. Ltd, a private company which runs the Guardian Bus service, operates day and night passenger bus and courier services to a number of destinations in Western Kenya, Rift Valley, Mombasa and East African towns of Kampala and Mwanza (Does not Operate this days). A new service has been started from Kisumu to Kigali in Rwanda.
Other bus companies in Kenya include Modern Coast, Nyamira Express, Otange, MASH, Vanga, Simba coach, Xenon dreamline, Messina, MAslah, Amani coaches, west coaches, Horizon, 2nk sacco, Chania Comfort, chania genesis, parrot line, x calibur and Crown Bus but there are a number of other companies which offer inter-city services such as Eldoret Express,Kawere, Climax, Greenline, Western Express, Mbukinya, Kalita Coaches and Palmdam.There also number of shuttle companies operating van to western Kenya such as Sasaline, Blueline, Classic, Khukhu, Royal Rift, Transline msafiri, Transline classic, Premium shuttles, Nyanza shuttle, North Rift, Molo Line and Mash Poa.Taxedo


=== Regulation and Enforcement ===
In February 2004 the Ministry of Transport in Kenya introduced new regulations governing the operation of Matatus. These regulations (famously referred to as "Michuki Rules") include: the compulsory fitting of safety belts and speed governors. In addition, standing on matatus was banned. As a result of these regulations, many matatus were taken off the road, which caused great disruption to public transport, forcing many people to walk to work. Now the situation has stabilised, and the new regulations have resulted in a great reduction of the number of people killed and injured in accidents. Due to lax enforcement after the initial push, the number of deaths in road accidents had increased in recent years.
On 1 December 2012 the government will begin to enforce the recently amended traffic act which has significantly increased the penalties for offences. Matatu operators have protested the move through strike action.


=== International highways ===
Two routes in the Trans-African Highway network pass through Kenya and the capital, Nairobi:

The Cairo-Cape Town Highway, Trans-African Highway 4, linking North Africa, East Africa and Southern Africa. From Nairobi southwards this is one of the most heavily used routes in the network, and includes one of the longest complete paved sections. However, it still has missing links to the north and it is not practical to travel to Cairo without off-road vehicles. This part will be completed as part of the LAPSSET project.
The Lagos-Mombasa Highway, Trans-African Highway 8, links East Africa and West Africa. It is only complete between the Ugandan–DR Congo border and Mombasa, linking the African Great Lakes region to the sea. It is also named the 'Trans-African Highway'.


== Airports ==


=== Airports – with paved runways ===
total: 16
over 3,047 m: 5
2,438 to 3,047 m: 2
1,524 to 2,437 m: 2
914 to 1,523 m: 6
under 914 m: 1 (2013)
Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, is Kenya's largest airport and serves the most destinations. 
Some international flights go to Moi International Airport in Mombasa. Kisumu Airport was upgraded to an international airport in 2011 and a second phase of expansion is under way. In 2012, US Navy Seebees built a major new tarmac runway at Wajir Airport that can take heavy aircraft.


=== Airports – with unpaved runways ===
total: 181
1,524 to 2,437 m: 14
914 to 1,523 m: 107
under 914 m: 60 (2013)
Many airports with unpaved runways serve private purposes, such as private game parks and safari lodges, but are still serviced by airlines like AirKenya


== Railways ==

Total: 2,066 km (1,284 mi)
1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) metre gauge: 2,066 km
The former Uganda Railway, was run by the company East African Railways. It jointly served the present countries of Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Since the dissolution of the EAR corporation in 1977, the national company Kenya Railways Corporation runs the former Uganda Railway and its branches in Kenya. The most important line in the country runs between the port of Mombasa and Nairobi, sleeping car accommodation is offered for tourists.
In 2006, the Rift Valley Railways Consortium led by South African companies took over the operation of the Kenyan and Ugandan railway network on a contract lasting 25 years, with the opportunity of renewal. After criticism from the Kenya Railways Corporation, RVR doubled the frequency of service, and also imposed restrictions to reduce train derailments caused by the ageing infrastructure.RVR run passenger trains within Kenya only, primarily from Nairobi to Mombasa but also to local towns such as Kisumu. Passenger services on these lines are offered on peak periods only. Freight services are the bulk of RVR's operations.
In 2008, agreements were made with Uganda about gauge standardisation.


=== Railway links with adjacent countries ===
African Great Lakes South Sudan – none – proposed link to Juba (2005) break-of-gauge 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in)/1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in)
 Tanzania – same 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) gauge – maybe defunct
 Uganda – yes – same gauge – 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in)


== Waterways ==
Part of the Lake Victoria system is within the boundaries of Kenya. Kenya has a major international port at Mombasa, serving both Kenya and Uganda.  Kisumu on Lake Victoria is also another major port, which has ferry connections to Uganda and Tanzania.


=== Merchant Marine ===
Total:" 3 ships (with a volume of 1,000 gross tonnage (GT) or over) 6,049 GT/7,082 tonnes deadweight (DWT)
By type: passenger/cargo 2, petroleum tanker 1
Registered in other countries: 6 (2006)


=== Ports and harbours ===

Mombasa has the only commercial port that reaches international standards. Mombasa's commercial port is called Kilindini Harbour and is run by the Kenya Ports Authority, it lies on the Indian Ocean.
There are plans to build another international port in Lamu to the north east of Mombasa.
There is an inland port at Kisumu which serves Lake Victoria.  In 2015 a new ferry was delivered to Kisumu by road.

Title: R-46 (missile)
Aspects: {'R46'}

The R-46 was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) design by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The R-46 concept was to launch a very large hydrogen bomb into orbit as a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS).  The existence of the system was alluded to in a speech by then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1961.  The design was not developed, however, and the FOBS concept was abandoned as part of SALT II.

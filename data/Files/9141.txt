Title: Prince engine
Aspects: {'N13'}

Prince is the codename for a family of automobile straight-4 engines developed by PSA Peugeot Citroën and BMW. It is a compact engine family of 1.4–1.6 L in displacement and includes most modern features including gasoline direct injection, turbocharging, BMW VANOS and variable valve timing.
The BMW versions of the Prince engine are known as the N13 and the Mini versions are known as the N14 and N18. It replaced the Tritec engine family in the Mini and was first introduced in 2006 for MINI. Later in 2011 also for BMW models F20 116i and 118i. This was the first longitudinal engine mount option for Prince engine.
PSA has started to use the Prince family in 2006 to replace a part of their TU family (the other part being replaced by the EB engine) — the Peugeot 207 being the first car to receive it.
The engine's components are produced by PSA at their Douvrin, France, facility, with MINI and BMW engine assembly at Hams Hall in Warwickshire, UK.  The co-operation was announced on 23 July 2002 with the first engines produced in 2006. The Prince engine project is not related to the Prince Motor Company.
In late 2006, an extension of the cooperation between the two groups was announced, promising new four-cylinder engines, without further details.
On 29 September 2010, it was announced by BMW that the 1.6Turbo version of the Prince engine would be supplied from 2012 to Saab for use in forthcoming models, primarily the 9-3. However with the closure of SAAB supply never started.
At the Geneva Auto Show 2011, Saab unveiled their latest concept vehicle Saab PhoeniX with BMW Prince Engine 1.6T 200 bhp (149 kW; 203 PS); On 25 June 2014 1.6-litre turbo Prince engine won its eighth consecutive International Engine of the Year Award in the 1.4 to 1.8-litre category. In 2014 the Prince engine beat, among others, the new BMW B38 engine which is replacing the Prince engine in the Mini and BMW lineups.


== Design ==
The Prince family shares its basic block dimensions with the previous PSA TU engine family. Engineering design was directed by PSA with some support provided by BMW, including their Valvetronic variable valve lift system on the intake side. Other features include on-demand oil and water pumps. Gasoline direct injection with a twin-scroll turbocharger will be used on the higher power versions.All Prince engines will share 84 mm (3.31 in) cylinder bore spacing, with 77 mm (3.03 in) bore. The 1.6 litre engine has a stroke of 85.8 mm (3.38 in). The engine features a two-piece "bedplate" aluminum crankcase for extra stiffness.


== 1.4 litre  EP3/EP3C (PSA) ==
The 1.4 L PSA EP3 and EP3C is the smallest member of the Prince family with a stroke measuring 75 mm (2.95 in) and total capacity of 1,397 cc (1.4 L). Depending on application, power output varies from 90 to 95 PS (66 to 70 kW; 89 to 94 bhp) while torque varies from 136 to 140 N⋅m (100 to 103 lb⋅ft).

== BMW N13 version ==
The turbocharged 1.6 litre version used by BMW is called the BMW N13. The N13 replaced the naturally aspirated BMW N43 engine and was produced from 2011 to 2016. It is BMW's first turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine since the BMW 2002 Turbo ceased production in 1974.
BMW sold the N13 alongside the larger displacement BMW N20 turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The N13 was effectively replaced by the turbocharged three-cylinder BMW B38 engine.

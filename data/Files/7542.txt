Title: Kabar (grape)
Aspects: {'Kabar (disambiguation)'}

Kabar, also known as Tarcal 10, is a crossing of Hárslevelű and Bouvier and was authorised for production in the Tokaj-Hegyalja region of Hungary in 2006. With a relatively low yield, it ripens early, produces high sugar and is prone to botrytis. Due to its thick skin, it is fairly resistant to late autumn rains.

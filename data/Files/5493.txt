== Gloria Gaynor version ==
The song was released as a single by Gloria Gaynor in 1983 and went on to become one of the singer's best known songs. Producer Joel Diamond recognized the song's disco potential when he saw La Cage Aux Folles on Broadway and arranged for Gaynor - whose 1978 ...Park Avenue Sound album he'd produced - to record it.  A club hit in America, Gaynor's version of "I Am What I Am" was a Top 40 hit throughout Europe becoming established as a global gay anthem.

It was written by Derek Bramble and Franne Golde, produced by Narada Michael Walden, and released on October 18, 1991 as the album's fifth single.

The song garnered Houston a nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 35th Grammy Awards (1992).


== Critical reception ==
James Hunter of Rolling Stone said that the song "acts out its claim in a penthouse bedroom", and described its production by Narada Michael Walden as "high-end grooves accented by pinballing counterrhythms."


== Music video ==
The music video features some shots from "My Name Is Not Susan" that are extended and/or unreleased in the video to that song. Former boxer heavyweight champion Mike Tyson is also featured in the video. The video also includes footage from Houston's I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour (1991).

As well as being presented with the trophy, the winning team also qualifies for the AFC Cup. If the winners have already qualified for the AFC Cup via Lebanese Premier League, or are not entitled to play in AFC competitions for any reason, the place goes to the next highest placed finisher in the league table.
There are a total of six rounds in the competition. The competition begins in September with the first round and is contested only by 14 clubs: all 12 Lebanese Second Division clubs and two Lebanese Third Division clubs. Six winners of the first round go on to play the second round in November, with the three winners of the second round qualifying to the round of 16, as well as one winner from the first round. In this phase, played in January, all the 12 current Lebanese Premier League teams enter, bringing the total to 16 teams. Between April and May, the quarter-finals and the semi-finals are disputed, with final being contested at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium in May.

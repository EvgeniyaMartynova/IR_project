Title: Chrysler F platform
Aspects: {'F-body'}

Chrysler's rear wheel drive F platform was used from 1976 to 1980.  It was replaced by the nearly identical Chrysler M platform.  There were two wheelbases: 108.7 in for 2-door models, and 112.7 in for four-doors. As the market evolved, these would be marketed as mid-size and eventually take on full-sized nameplates such as Plymouth Fury for police and fleet applications. These were effectively replaced by the very successful Chrysler K platform in standard and stretch sizes which retained two bench seats, column shifter and room for six, unlike many other compact-sized cars modeled after non-American designs.
Cars that used the F platform include:

1976–1980 Dodge Aspen/Plymouth Volare
1979–1980 Plymouth Duster
1976–1980 Plymouth Road Runner
1976–1980 Dodge Dart (Mexico)
1976–1980 Dodge Super Bee (Mexico)
1976–1980 Chrysler Valiant/Valiant Volare
1977–1980 Monteverdi Sierra

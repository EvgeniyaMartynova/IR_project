Title: FIFA U-20 World Cup
Aspects: {'U20'}

The FIFA U-20 World Cup is the biennial football world championship for male players under the age of 20, organised by FIFA. The competition has been staged every two years since the first tournament in 1977 held in Tunisia. Until 2005 it was known as the FIFA World Youth Championship. The current champion is Ukraine, which won its first title at the 2019 tournament in Poland.


== History ==
In the twenty-two tournaments held, eleven different nations have won the title. Argentina is the most successful team with six titles, followed by Brazil with five titles. Portugal and Serbia have both won two titles (with the latter winning once as Yugoslavia), while Ghana, Germany, Spain, France, England, Ukraine and Russia (as the USSR with Ukrainian players Bessonov, Bal) have won the title once each.
A corresponding event for women's teams, the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, began in 2002 with the name "FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship" and an age limit of 19. The age limit for the women's competition was changed to 20 beginning with the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship, and the competition was renamed as a "World Cup" in 2007 in preparation for the 2008 event. The next edition will be held in 2021 in Indonesia.


== Qualification ==
24 teams appear in the final tournament. 23 countries, including the defending champions, have to qualify in the youth championships of the six confederations.  The host country automatically qualifies.

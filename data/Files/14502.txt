The music video filmed in Morocco and was directed by Glenn Smith. It features a boy infatuated with football. But his father wants him to quit and lend a helping hand in herding the sheep. Frustrated by this, the boy runs away from home and finds himself in a larger Moroccan city where he becomes a street vendor. There he meets La Fouine and while trying to sell him a merchandise, he also offers to La Fouine a cup of tea. La Fouine touched by the boy's gesture gives him a considerable tip with which the boy is able to buy a football shirt from another street vendor carrying the name and number 23 of his favorite player the Brazilian David Luiz who at the time was playing for Paris Saint-Germain.

Title: Frankfort OQ-16
Aspects: {'Q16'}

The Frankfort OQ-16, also known as the TD3D, was a target drone designed by the Frankfort Sailplane Company for use by the United States Army Air Forces and United States Navy.
The OQ-16 was developed under a contract for a radio-controlled target drone awarded in early 1945. Fifteen aircraft were ordered by the USAAF; later in the year the contract was transferred to the United States Navy, which assigned the designation TD3D-1 to the type. However, the contract was cancelled before any of the aircraft were built.

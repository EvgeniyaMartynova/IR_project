State Route 87 (SR 87) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia.  Known for most of its length as Morehead Road, the state highway runs 4.10 miles (6.60 km) from the North Carolina state line, where the highway continues as North Carolina Highway 14 (NC 14)/NC 87, north to U.S. Route 220 (US 220) in Ridgeway in southern Henry County.


== Route description ==

SR 87 begins at the North Carolina state line southeast of Ridgeway.  The highway continues southeast as NC 14/NC 87 toward Eden.  SR 87 heads northwest as Morehead Road to the town of Ridgeway, within which the highway follows Morehead Avenue.  In the center of town, the state highway intersects US 220 Business, which heads north on Main Street and south on Church Street.

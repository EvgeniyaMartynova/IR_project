Timothy Yap of Hallels.com wrote that "Many contemporary Christian artists may sing about the marvel of redemption, but when Lauren Daigle does it with her smoky alto she commands attention.  There's a holy gravitas that resonates within this Louisiana native's pipes that we can't help but be drawn in." Jeanie Law of Breathcast summarized that "Lauren Daigle's debut release How Can It Be on Centricity Music will serve as a breath of fresh air for music lovers with its raw emotion, honest lyrics, and Daigle's infectious voice."

== Description ==
The leaves are oblong, 5 cm in length, and form a basal rosette which develops from round underground nodules that are up to 6 cm in diameter. Stems supported emerge vertically from the rosette and are covered for a third of their length with a light green bract. The flowering period is from April to June, during which an inflorescence of small white to pink flowers are produced.

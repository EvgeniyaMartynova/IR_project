Title: Brachypelma andrewi
Aspects: {'B. andrewi'}

Brachypelma andrewi is a species of spider in the family Theraphosidae (tarantulas). Only the male has been described and its distribution is unknown.


== Description ==
Only a male preserved since 1875 has been described, initially incorrectly as Euathlus truculentus. Its body length is 55 mm; the fourth leg is longest at 67 mm. The general colour is blackish brown, with long orange-red hairs on the abdomen and legs. The femurs of the legs have bronze gold hairs. The palpal bulb has a wide embolus tapering to a point, typical of Brachypelma species as opposed to the long tapered embolus of Euathlus species.


== Taxonomy ==
In a study published in 1992, Andrew Smith described a specimen in the British Museum of Natural History believing it to be a male of Euathlus truculentus. He used his description to support the view held at the time that the genus Brachypelma was synonymous with Euathlus. However, shortly afterwards in 1992, GÃ¼nter Schmidt realized that this specimen was not the same species as the type of Euathlus truculentus, but was in fact a new species of Brachypelma, which he called B. andrewi after Andrew Smith. Smith accepted that he had been mistaken. As of September 2017, only this male has been described.


== Distribution ==
The label on the described specimen says "Cuba", but this is considered unlikely as its place of origin, the presumption being that it was purchased in Havana, Cuba.

Aspects: {'D. maxima'}

Doodia maxima (synonym Blechnum maximum), also known as the giant rasp fern, occurs in moist open forests in eastern Australia. It was considered to be a natural hybrid. It has been moved from Doodia maxima to Blechnum maximum, but in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it is retained in Doodia.

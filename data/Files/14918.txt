The airline was established in June 2004 and started operations on 15 November 2004. It was owned by Htoo Trading Co. Ltd. Its first international service was flown from Yangon to Bangkok on 15 May 2007, and the second to Singapore from 7 September 2007. Air Bagan was listed as a Specially Designated National by the United States Department of the Treasury for its association with the Government of Myanmar, meaning U.S. citizens are generally prohibited from dealing with the airline by U.S. sanctions against the government of Myanmar.When Cyclone Nargis struck Lower Myanmar in May 2008, the Burmese government gave Air Bagan and its parent company, Htoo Trading Co. Ltd responsibility to reconstruct the badly devastated town of Bogale in the Ayeyarwaddy Delta.In August 2015 Air Bagan announced that it suspended all flights. All flights were then operated by its code-sharing partner Asian Wings; which is also owned by the Htoo Trading Co. Ltd.
The airline ceased operations again and handed back its licence to the authorities in August 2018.

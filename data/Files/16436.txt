Title: Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)
Aspects: {'Yahoo (disambiguation)'}

Yahoos are legendary beings in the 1726 satirical novel Gulliver's Travels written by Jonathan Swift.  Their behavior and character representation is meant to comment on the state of Europe from Swift's point of view.  The word "yahoo" was coined by Jonathan Swift in the fourth section of Gulliver's Travels and has since entered the English language more broadly. Its most famous use is as the name of a pioneering search engine, Yahoo!.


== The original character ==
Swift describes Yahoos as filthy with unpleasant habits, "a brute in human form," resembling human beings far too closely for the liking of protagonist Lemuel Gulliver.  He finds the calm and rational society of intelligent horses, the Houyhnhnms, greatly preferable. 
The Yahoos are primitive creatures obsessed with "pretty stones" that they find by digging in mud, thus representing the distasteful materialism and ignorant elitism Swift encountered in Britain. Hence the term "yahoo" has come to mean "a crude, brutish or obscenely coarse person".


== Later mentions ==

American frontiersman Daniel Boone, who often used terms from Gulliver's Travels, claimed that he killed a hairy giant that he called a Yahoo.Yahoos were referred to in a letter sent by serial killer David Berkowitz to New York City police while committing the "Son of Sam" murders in 1976.In The Pathfinder, Chapter XV, by James Fenimore Cooper, Charles Cap says "They must be regular Yahoos," regarding sailors who navigate the Great Lakes without charts.

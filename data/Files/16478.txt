His father, Paul Yakabuski, was also a Tory Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the area from 1963 to 1987.


== Background ==
Yakabuski is a former real estate sales representative, and was for twenty years the owner and operator of Yakabuski's Home Hardware in Barry's Bay, Ontario.  At the time of his election, he was a member of the steering committee of St. Francis Memorial Hospital's Capital Equipment Campaign.  He is also active in the local Lutheran church. His late brother, Kim Yakabuski, was the life partner of former Liberal Attorney-General Ian Scott. His brother, Konrad Yakabuski, is a columnist for the Globe and Mail.

== Politics ==
Yakabuski was elected to the Barry's Bay municipal council in 1997, and was responsible for overseeing various issues concerning the region's amalgamation.  He did not seek re-election in 2000.
Yakabuski was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 2003 provincial election, defeating Liberal Derek Nighbor by 595 votes.  This result was regarded by some as an upset, as it was the only formerly Liberal seat to be won by the Tories in an election that saw the Liberals elected to a strong majority government. Moreover, the seat had been held for many years by Liberal Sean Conway (Yakabuski's second cousin). However, Yakabuski benefited from a growing social conservative trend in the region. He won the election despite publicizing of his earlier convictions by the opposition press.In the 2007 provincial election, he was easily re-elected, defeating Liberal candidate Sean Kelly by over 15,000 votes. He was re-elected in both the 2011 provincial election and the 2014 provincial election.Yakabuski was the Labour and Training Critic in the Official Opposition and the Whip of the Official Opposition. He ran for the position of interim leader of the party following the resignation of Tim Hudak but was passed over in favour of Jim Wilson.Yakabuski now serves as the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry.

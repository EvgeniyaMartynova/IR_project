Title: Al-Anfāl
Aspects: {'Q8'}

Al-Anfāl (Arabic: الأنفال‎, "The Spoils of War") is the eighth chapter (sūrah) of the Qur'an, with 75 verses (āyāt). Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (Asbāb al-nuzūl), it is a "Medinan surah", completed after the Battle of Badr.
It forms a pair with the next sura, At-Tawba.

=== Badr ===
Badr is also the subject of Sura 8: al-Anfāl, which details military conduct and operations.  Though the Sura does not name Badr, it describes the battle several times:

These verses highlighted both the chance encounter of the battle (both sides had blundered into each other) as well as the underestimation of both the size of Meccan army by the Muslims and the fierceness of the Muslim army by the Meccans. The Meccan army was described in the second verses, and "Satan" may be referring to Amr ibn Hishām, who was hated by the Muslims and allegedly pushed for the battle repeatedly.


== Exegesis ==
Muhammad al-Baqir narrates in hadith that (8:41) Know that whatever property you may gain, one fifth belongs to God, the Messenger, for near relatives and the orphans, the needy, and the [stranded] traveler,... refers to the relatives of the Messenger of Allah.  "Al-Khums (one fifth) belongs to Allah, the Messenger and to us (his Ahl al-Bayt)".One source states that Ubay ibn Khalaf was ransomed after Badr, but was killed by Muslims with a spear in the Battle of Uhud (625 CE). Verse [Quran 8:17] was revealed in this occasion.

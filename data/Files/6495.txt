Title: Rembrandt's J'Accuse
Aspects: {"J'accuse (disambiguation)"}

Rembrandt's J'Accuse is a 2008 Dutch, German and Finnish documentary film directed by Peter Greenaway about criticism of today's visual illiteracy argued by means of a forensic search of Rembrandt's painting The Night Watch. Greenaway explains the conspiracy about a murder and the motives of all its characters who have conspired to kill for their combined self-advantage.
The film is considered a companion piece, since it came out a year after Greenaway's Nightwatching, a narrative film about Rembrandt featuring most of the same actors and sets.

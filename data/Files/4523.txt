Title: LNWR Class G2A
Aspects: {'G2A (disambiguation)'}

The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Class G2A was a class of 0-8-0 steam locomotives.  They were upgraded from LNWR Class G1 principally by the fitting of a higher pressure boiler.   Some of the G2As subsequently received lower pressure boilers on overhaul, taking them back into Class G1.


== Numbering ==
On nationalisation in 1948, British Railways (BR) received 320 G2As, thus making them the largest ex-LNWR class received by BR.  They were numbered in the range 48893â€“49394 but the number series is not continuous because some numbers in the same range were given to G1 Class locomotives.


== Preservation ==
None was preserved, although a very similar LNWR Class G2 No. 49395 was.

Title: List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)
Aspects: {'I Am Waiting'}

The English progressive rock band Yes has toured for five decades.
The band played live from its creation in Summer 1968. Their first overseas shows were in Belgium and the Netherlands in June 1969. They played regularly through December 1980, with the band splitting up early the next year. The band reformed in 1983, and regular tours resumed in 1984 and continued over the next few decades. The longest break in touring came from late 2004 through late 2008. Touring has tended to focus on the UK and the rest of Europe, The United States, Canada and Japan, but the band have also played other parts of the world, notably Australia.

Title: ThinkPad X series
Aspects: {'X series'}

The ThinkPad X series is a line of notebook computers and convertible tablets originally produced by IBM and now marketed by Lenovo.
IBM announced the ThinkPad X series (initially the X20) in September 2000 with the intention of providing “workers on the move with a better experience in extra-thin and extra-light mobile computing.” The ThinkPad X series replaced both the 240 and 570 series during IBM's transition from numbered to letter series during the early 2000s. The first X Series laptops were "slimmer than a deck of cards" and "lighter than a half-gallon of milk", despite the presence of a 12.1-inch Thin-film transistor (TFT LCD) display. These design values—thin and light—continued to be integral to the ThinkPad X-series laptops' design and marketing, even after the purchase of IBM's Personal Computing Division by Lenovo. The first X Series ThinkPad released by Lenovo was the X41 in 2005.The ThinkPad X-series laptops from Lenovo were described by Trusted Reviews as "combining an ultraportable's weight and form factor with a durable design." The X-series laptop styles include traditional ultraportables, as well as convertible tablet designs. According to Lenovo, the ThinkPad X-series laptops include low power processors, offer long battery life, and several durability features such as a Roll Cage (Magnesium Frame around the Display), magnesium alloy covers, and a spill-resistant keyboard but currently lacks a replaceable battery and upgradable RAM slots.

=== 2005 ===


==== X41, X41 tablet ====
Three years after the release of the X30, upon acquiring the ThinkPad division, Lenovo released the ThinkPad X41 ultraportable laptop and the ThinkPad X41 tablet. The X41 tablet was convertible, with the capacity to function as a tablet PC and an ultraportable laptop.


==== X32 ====

The X32 was introduced in 2005. The numbering system was irregular, as it was actually introduced after the X40, but using the older X3x chassis design. It was also more powerful than the X40 and X41 units, due to the use of faster full-voltage Dothan processors and standard 2.5" 5400/7200 RPM hard drives. It was a very short-lived model, discontinued within months of introduction. On this model, IBM included Gigabit LAN and the Security Sub System on all models. The X32 and X41 are two of the last IBM-designed ThinkPads, before Lenovo took over. The X41 tablet was designed by Lenovo.


=== 2006 ===
The X-series laptops released in 2006 from Lenovo were the X60, X60s, and X60 tablet.


==== X60 and X60s ====

The X60 and X60s slimline differed primarily by their processors: the X60s had a low voltage processor, while the X60 did not. This gave the X60s a lower active temperature and longer battery life in exchange for reduced performance. The X60s also had a smaller heatsink and a slightly thinner case with a different battery form factor, although it could use standard X60 batteries with a plastic adapter.
In its review of the ThinkPad X60/X60s, Notebook Review called the laptop, "Hands down the best performing ultraportable on the market", while raising issues about the design and the lack of an optical drive.The two laptops were available in a variety of configurations. Later X60 models used 64-bit Core 2 Duo CPUs, and some X60s were available with a lightweight LCD panel. Typical specifications of the laptops are provided below:

Processor:
Intel Core Solo T1300 (1.6 GHz), Core Duo T2300E, T2400, T2500 (1.66–2.0 GHz) or Core 2 Duo T5500, T5600, T7200 (1.66–2.0 GHz) — X60
Intel Core Duo L2300, L2400, L2500 (1.50–1.83 GHz), or Core 2 Duo L7400 (1.50 GHz) — X60s
Chipset: Intel 945GM
Memory: up to 3.2 GB DDR2 (2 slots, fits 4 GB, but chipset limit is 3.2 GB)
Graphics: Intel GMA 950
Storage: 1 × 2.5" SATA 1.5 Gbit/s (80 GB 5400 RPM)
Display: 12.1 in (31 cm) 1024 × 768 CCFL-backlit TN LCD
Mass/Weight: starting at 1.43 kg (3.15 lb) (X60), or 1.38 kg (3.04 lb) (X60s)
Operating System: Microsoft Windows XP Professional


==== X60 tablet ====
The ThinkPad X60 tablet was praised by reviewers. LAPTOP Magazine said the ThinkPad X60 tablet "raises the bar for business-class convertibles". The most significant issue raised was the low capacity 4-cell battery, which provided a battery life of two hours.


== Lenovo-branded models ==


=== 2007 ===
The X Series laptops released by Lenovo in 2007 were the X61, the X61s, and the X61 tablet.


==== X61 and X61s ====

The X61 received mixed user reviews on CNET, with some users reporting display problems and delivery delays, while others praised the laptop for performance and portability.Reviewers, however, praised the ultraportable. Notebook Review called it an "extremely fast ultraportable". However, they criticized the display colors and viewing angles. They also pointed out that the palm rest was prone to heating up because of the wireless networking card underneath it.The X61s was lauded for its excellent build quality, performance, and long battery life. The battery was an improvement over the X41. The model is one of the last to feature a 4∶3 aspect ratio display.

Some X60s models shipped with the Intel Core 2 Duo L7300 clocked at 1.40 GHz or the L7700 clocked at 1.80 GHz. As of 2018 it was still possible to purchase new batteries and spare parts for these laptops from a few online retailers.


==== X61 tablet ====

The ThinkPad X61 tablet also received positive reviews, with IT Reviews saying that "the build quality and engineering are second to none and this shines through with the tablet features which have been executed with something close to genius". However, the high price tag and relatively inadequate performance were criticized by the reviewer.tabletPC Review acknowledged the sturdiness of the X61 tablet, the high battery life, and the quality of the pen. The features that met with disfavor were the lack of a widescreen, display brightness and colors, and the lack of an optical drive—although the reviewer admitted that the absence helps reduce weight.


=== 2008 ===
The laptops released in the X series in 2008 followed the new naming conventions established by Lenovo. The X Series laptops released by Lenovo in 2008 were X200, X200 tablet and X300.


==== X200 and X200s ====

The ThinkPad X200 was released on 15 July 2008. It leveraged the new technology from the X300, including the options of a solid-state drive (SSD), an optional integrated camera, 12.1 in (31 cm) widescreen display, optional 3G mobile broadband card, a new 9-cell battery for extended running time up to 9.8 hours, weight as low as 1.34 kg (2.95 lb), and an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU up to 2.66 GHz. This was one of the last models of the X-Series able to run Libreboot, a Free Software BIOS replacement.
Lenovo released X200s on 23 September 2008. It differed from the standard X200 in being lighter, having longer battery life, and running more quietly due to an "owl fan" design for cooling taken from the X300. The X200s was available with more than half a dozen different CPUs and three screen options; the top of the range was a WXGA+ LED-Backlit TN Panel.

The X200s features cooler components (made possible with the fan design modeled on owl-wings). However, both laptops did not have a touchpad (only the TrackPoint), no HDMI, DVI, or DisplayPort, and no built-in optical drive. The X200 series included tablet PC models, designated by the usage of the "t" suffix, primarily the X230t.


==== X200 tablet ====
Lenovo released X200 tablet on 9 September 2008. Like other tablet-designated models this added a convertible screen assembly containing a touch digitizer with pen and buttons on the screen front for operating the device without access to keyboard and buttons in converted mode.


==== X300 and X301 ====

Codenamed "Kodachi", with X300 released on 26 February 2008. It is distinguished from other ultraportable laptops by its use of LED backlighting, removable battery, solid-state drive, and integrated DVD burner. The ThinkPad X300 used a small form factor Intel GS965 chipset (instead of the standard GM965 chipset), along with the Intel Core 2 Duo L7100 low-voltage CPU (with 12 W Thermal design power (TDP). Its successor, the ThinkPad X301 uses the Intel Centrino 2 mobile platform with GS45 chipset, and an ultra-low-voltage (ULV) CPU. It also integrates GPS, WWAN, and a webcam in the top lid. The thickest part of the laptop is 23 mm (0.92 in), while the thinnest part is 19 mm (0.73 in).
The X300's original internal codename was "Razor", after the then-popular Motorola Razr flip phone. Lenovo noticed that three technologies were converging that would make it possible to build a very thin, light, and fast ThinkPad. The first was solid-state storage, which would replace mechanical hard drives. The second was light-emitting diode (LED) backlighting for flat-panel displays which would improve battery life and image quality. The third was ultrathin optical drives just 7 mm thick, compared to 9.5 mm and 12.7 mm used by previous ThinkPads. The Razor concept was eventually merged with the Bento-Fly project and renamed Kodachi.
The price at the time of the review by Notebook Review was extremely high, and indicated to be out of range for all but corporate users. LAPTOP Magazine awarded the X300 laptop a score of 4.5 stars, among the highest for a ThinkPad X-series laptop.
This laptop was less than an inch thick, making it the thinnest ThinkPad available at the time. The X300 laptop offered a quick boot with SSD. It also offered a built-in optical drive, uncommon in thin and light notebooks. However, the laptop did not include an SD card reader, had no expansion dock capability, and no ExpressCard or PC Card slot.


=== 2010 ===
The X-series laptops released in 2010 from Lenovo were the X100e, X201, X201s, and X201 tablet.


==== X100e and Mini 10 ====
The ThinkPad X100e was released in 2010, with Engadget calling the laptop "the perfect solution between a netbook and a larger 13- or 14-inch ULV ultraportable". Available in two colors (heatwave red and the traditional ThinkPad matte black) the design was compared to that of the Edge series which deviated from traditional ThinkPad design. The X100e, however, despite the choice of colors, retained the "angular edges and boxy build" which "scream traditional ThinkPad design".The specifications of the X100e laptop are given below:

Operating System: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 32-bitA modified and re-branded low-cost version of the Lenovo X100e, named the Mini 10 was issued to all year 9 students in NSW Australia at the start of 2010. They featured an Intel Atom N450 (1.66 GHz) processor, 160GB HDD, 2GB RAM, a 10" 1024×600 Screen (fitted in a 11.6" frame), 0.3MP Webcam and Windows 7 Enterprise.


==== X201 and X201s ====
The main 12-inch line-up only received an internal hardware update and a new palmrest with a touchpad. 

The X201i model is a version of regular X201 with a Core i3 CPU.


==== X201 tablet ====
The X201 tablet, released in 2010, was criticized by Engadget for its lack of durability, protruding battery, and 33 mm (1.3 in) thick body, while praised for its performance. Notebook Review had similar views about the X201 tablet in terms of both performance and battery life while indicating the display was superior to that of the X201 or X201s.


=== 2011 ===
The ThinkPad X-series laptops released in 2011 by Lenovo were the X120e, X220, X220i, X220 tablet and X1.

==== X220 ====
The ThinkPad X220 was released in April 2011 with a new thinner, latchless case and a 16:9 screen. LAPTOP Magazine received the X220 positively. It was praised for its battery life, performance, low weight, display, keyboard, and significantly improved temperature control. However, the web camera did not receive favor—while images were crisp and clear, colors were reported to be muted.Engadget said the "all-too-familiar ThinkPad can deceive you with its boring business looks, but it's arguably one of the best laptops we've ever tested". Notebook Review was of the same opinion, stating that the "ThinkPad X220 is quite simply the best 12-inch business notebook we've reviewed so far."The laptop's specifications are given below:

Dimensions: 305 mm × 206.5 mm × 19 mm–34.6 mm (12.01 in × 8.13 in × 0.75 in–1.36 in)The X220i uses the same motherboard and chipset as the standard X220, but has a less powerful Intel Core i3 processor, compared to the i5 and i7 options available for the X220. As another cost-reducing measure, the X220i was not offered with an IPS display option.


==== X220 tablet ====
The X220 tablet was also released in April 2011. It offered the same specifications as the X220 laptop in terms of processor, graphics, and RAM. The battery life on the X220 tablet was up to nine hours with a 6-cell battery and up to 18 hours with an external battery pack and a 6-cell battery. The starting weight of the tablet was 3.88 lbs.


==== X1 ====

An addition to the lightweight X series, weighing between 1.36 kg to 1.72 kg depending on configuration. It was the thinnest ThinkPad laptop to date at 16.5 (front) and 21.5 mm (rear). The screen is a 13.3-inch (340 mm) LED-backlit HD infinity panel with 1366 × 768 (WXGA) resolution.

==== X230 ====
The ThinkPad X230 announced on 15 May 2012 replaced the earlier X220. The X230 uses the same chassis, but introduced a new chiclet-style, 6-row keyboard replacing the classic 7-row keyboard style, Ivy Bridge processor and for the first time in the X-series—USB 3.0. The new keyboard design became a controversial topic in the ThinkPad community along with the locked down BIOS that discouraged third-party components including batteries or WLAN cards. The Ivy Bridge processors brought performance improvements compared to the X220, and the integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 are more than capable of delivering a good gaming experience in 4X or classic RTS games.
The maximum amount of installable memory is 16 GB in two memory slots, allowing for dual-channel RAM. Just like the X220, it is possible to use a mSATA SSD within the second Mini PCI Express slot instead of a WWAN card.Specifications:

720p HD webcam (04f2:b2eb Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd) or 3×3 Antenna GridX230i is just a i3-equipped version of a regular X230.


===== X230s =====
The X230s is an Asian-Market only model. More akin to the X240 instead of the X230, it gained many of the design cues later found on the X240 Line, and were equipped with Intel 3rd Gen ULV CPUs.


==== X230 Tablet ====
The ThinkPad X230 Tablet was announced on 15 May 2012 and replaced the earlier X220 tablet. The ThinkPad X230t is not compatible with previous series 3 docking stations (4337 and 4338) and is only compatible with the UltraBase series 3 "slice base". The X230t has a touchscreen with stylus support whereas the X230 has no touchscreen.


==== X1 Carbon ====

In early August 2012, Lenovo released the first generation of ThinkPad X1 Carbon announced on 15 May 2012. The X1 Carbon weighs 1.35 kg (3.0 lb), has a battery life of roughly eight hours, and has a start-up time of less than 20 seconds. The X1 Carbon was first released in China because of the popularity of ThinkPads in that market.The first X1 Carbon featured only an M.2 SSD instead of a 2.5" hard drive bay. The base model has 4 GB of memory, an Intel Core i5-3317U processor, and a 128 GB SSD. The most expensive model has an Intel Core i7 processor and a 256 GB SSD. The X1 Carbon requires a dongle to connect an ethernet cable, and some models include a 3G cellular modem.The first-generation X1 Carbon has a 14 in (36 cm) TN-panel LCD display with a resolution of 1600 × 900 (16∶9 aspect ratio). The X1 Carbon weighs 1.36 kg (3.0 lb) and measures 331 mm × 226 mm × 19 mm (13.03 in × 8.9 in × 0.74 in). The X1 Carbon's case is made of light carbon fiber and has a matte black finish. The Carbon is also marketed "as the thinnest 14" ultrabook.In a review published for CNET, Dan Ackerman wrote, "At first glance, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon looks a lot like other ThinkPads, but in the hand it stands out as very light and portable. The excellent keyboard shows up other ultrabooks, and the rugged build quality is reassuring. With a slightly boosted battery and maybe a lower starting price, this could be a serious contender for my all-around favorite thin laptop."Peter Bright wrote a disparaging review for Ars Technica. He found the new X1 Carbon with the "Adaptive Keyboard" to be near perfect but unusable because the keyboard was so non-standard when compared with that of a desktop or the older ThinkPad T410s and Lenovo Helix keyboards. As a touch typist, he despaired at the removal of the function keys, and the layout. He cited the repositioning of the Caps Lock key, replacing it with Home/End, and the positioning of the backspace and delete keys.In November 2012, Lenovo announced a touch-screen variant called the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch designed for use with Windows 8. Its display makes use of multi-touch technology that can detect simultaneous inputs from up to ten fingers. On the performance of the X1 Carbon Touch's SSD, Engadget states, "The machine boots into the Start screen in 11 seconds, which is pretty typical for a Windows 8 machine with specs like these. We also found that the solid-state drive delivers equally strong read and write speeds (551 MB/s and 518 MB/s, respectively), which we noticed the last time we tested an Ultrabook with an Intel SSD."


=== 2013 ===
The ThinkPad X Series laptops released in 2013 by Lenovo were the X240, X140e and ThinkPad Helix (Convertible tablet).


==== X240 and X240s ====

The ThinkPad X240 replaced the earlier X230 and X230s. Compared to the X230, the X240 changed from the higher-power Intel Core CPUs labelled as "mobile class", to the lower-power CPUs labelled "ultrabook class". Depending on the CPU model, the change resulted in a 10%–20% reduction in CPU performance compared to the older, but higher power Ivy Bridge generation CPUs. This was the first X-series laptop to forgo the classic TrackPoint buttons in favor of a touchpad that can also be pushed. The X240 reduced the maximum physical memory to 8 GB, with only one memory slot, making dual-channel unavailable (compared to 16 GB dual-channel in two memory slots on the X230), lost the dedicated insert key and volume control keys. The X240 uses the rectangular "slim tip" power plug.
The X240s is a slimmed down and lighter, Asian-market-only version of the X240 with the docking port missing and Power Bridge hot-swappable battery replaced with two internal batteries rated at 23.5 Wh each, which by extension removes the option to install larger 6-cell batteries in place of the default 3-cell.

Unlike previous models in the series, this has soldered RAM, a non-removable battery, and no built-in RJ45 ethernet port (although one is available via an extension cable). Some users have contended that this eliminates several of the central appeals of the X2* series, and that it effectively represents a replication of Lenovo's existing lines rather than a true continuation of the series.

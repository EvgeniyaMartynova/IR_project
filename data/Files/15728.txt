Title: Northrop Grumman X-47C
Aspects: {'X47'}

The Northrop Grumman X-47C is a design for a stealth, unmanned aircraft. Its ancestors the X-47A and the X-47B made this unmanned aircraft possible to carry out the "stealth" that was needed in order to be undetectable by radar. It is planned to have a payload of 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg), significantly exceeding that of the X-47A. The initial date for building the aircraft was in 2018, although changes will most likely be made as in whether to continue with the design or to use a more advanced system.

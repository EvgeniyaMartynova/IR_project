Title: D4 motorway (Slovakia)

D4 is a motorway in southwestern Slovakia. The planned highway is commonly referred to as the Bratislava bypass. Currently there is only a short stretch from Austrian border at Jarovce to the junction with D2 (part of the former D61), construction of which started in 1996 and was opened in 1998. There are plans to extend it to the motorway D1 between Bratislava and Senec in order to create a southern bypass of Bratislava, where it will intersect with planned expressway R7 as well.

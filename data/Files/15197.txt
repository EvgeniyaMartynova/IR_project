Title: Wabe River
Aspects: {'Wabe (disambiguation)'}

Wabe River (also Wabi River, Uabi River) is a west-southwest flowing river of south-central Ethiopia, entirely confined within the reaches of Gurage Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region.
This river is a perennial river. A principal tributary of the Omo River on the left side, it joins the much larger Gibe River at 8.224°N 37.623°E﻿ / 8.224; 37.623 from where the joint river continues as the Omo River. The river rises at an elevation of 2,850 m in the Shewan highlands and discharges into the Omo river at an elevation of 1060 m.
Due to its steep gradient, it is a very quickly flowing river with lots of falls. In particular to mention are the Acho Falls near Welkite with a height of 60 meters. Southwest of Welkite and several kilometers short of its confluence with the Omo River the river shows a very steep series of rapids with an elevation drop of ~400 m in just four kilometers. Due to its special characteristics, the river is (in 2018) under investigation for hydroelectric electricity generation by using the hydropower of the river.

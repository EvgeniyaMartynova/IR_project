Aspects: {'I Can Only Imagine'}

"I Can Only Imagine" is a song performed by French DJ David Guetta, featuring vocals from American singer Chris Brown and rapper Lil Wayne, from Guetta's fifth studio album Nothing but the Beat. It was released as the sixth single from the album on April 23, 2012. Prior to its official release, the song charted in the lower regions of the charts in Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Guetta, Brown and Wayne performed the song live for the first time at the 54th Grammy Awards on February 12, 2012.
The video was filmed on May 29, 2012, and premiered on July 2, 2012. It was directed by Colin Tilley. Guetta said how the video focuses more on futuristic images rather than on a plot as some of Guetta's other videos played out. It first opens up with Guetta walking into a room, and Brown appears in a mask as his eyes light up. As Brown starts singing in another scene, he is in a light-up suit. As the chorus plays, Brown is seen in a zero-gravity room. Guetta also then seen in the zero-gravity room. Wayne then is seen with a skateboard with a few other skateboarders in the background. Wayne is also located in another futuristic room. Brown is then seen in another room with a lit-up floor as he dances while he sings the chorus. Five other dancers join Brown.

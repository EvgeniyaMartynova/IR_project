The J platform was a designation used for two  automobile platforms from Chrysler Corporation in the 1980s.
The first was a rear-wheel drive platform, in production from 1980. It was very similar to the 4-door Chrysler F platform and Chrysler M platform, which were based on the Chrysler A platform.
The J platform was only used for coup√©s, and only for a few years:

1980-1983 Chrysler Cordoba
1980-1983 Dodge Mirada
1981-1983 ImperialA second, unrelated, J platform, this time a variant of the front-wheel drive K platform, arrived in 1987 with the introduction of the new Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible. This platform remained in production until 1995.

Title: HMS Usk (N65)
Aspects: {'N65'}

HMS Usk was a British U class submarine, of the second group of that class, built by Vickers Armstrong, Barrow-in-Furness. She was laid down on 6 November 1939 and was commissioned on 11 October 1940.


== Career and loss ==
Usk spent most of her short career operating in the Mediterranean. She sailed from Malta to patrol off the north west coast of Sicily on 19 April 1941. Usk was later ordered to alter her position due to intense anti-submarine activity. What happened subsequently is not known but she was most likely mined in the vicinity of Cape Bon some time after 25 April 1941. She was reported overdue on 3 May 1941.

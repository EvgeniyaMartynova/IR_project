Title: Al-Haaqqa
Aspects: {'Q69'}

Sūrat al-Ḥāqqah (Arabic: سورة الحاقة‎) is the 69th sura of the Qur'an with 52 ayat.  There are several English names under which the surah is known.  These include “The Inevitable Hour”, “The Indubitable”, “The Inevitable Truth”, and “The Reality”. These titles are derived from alternate translations of al-Ḥāqqa, the word that appears in the first three ayat of the sura. Though each of these titles may sound very different, each one alludes to the main theme of the sura – the Day of Judgment.


== Historical context ==
Al-Ḥāqqa is a Meccan sura, meaning it was revealed to the prophet while he lived in Mecca as opposed to Medina.  Meccan suras divided into early, middle, and late periods.  Theodor Nöldeke in his chronology of suras places the sura to be revealed in the early Meccan period.

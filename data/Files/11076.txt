Title: As-Sajda
Aspects: {'Q32'}

As-Sajdah (Arabic: السجدة‎, "The Prostration") is the 32nd chapter (sūrah) of the Quran with 30 verses (āyāt). 
Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbāb al-nuzūl), it is an earlier "Meccan surah", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.


== Name ==
The name of the chapter, which means "The Prostration", is taken from the fifteenth verse, which mentions those who "... fall prostrate and hymn the praise of their Lord". Alternative names of the chapter include Alif Lam Mim Tanzil ("Alif, Lam, Mim, The Revelation") after the first words of the chapter (verses 1 and 2), and Al-Madajiʻ ("The Beds"), after a mention of those who "shun [their] beds" in order to worship God at night (tahajjud).


== Revelation history ==
According to the Islamic tradition, the chapter was revealed during the Meccan phase of Muhammad's prophethood. Some scholars argue, based on attaching occasions of revelations, that several verses (some say verses 16–20, some say only 18–20, some say only 16) are from Medinan phase, but the arguments are not widely accepted. For example, Mahmud al-Alusi opines that the close connection between these verses and the preceding ones means that they are likely from the same period. The traditional Egyptian chronology puts the chapter as the 75th chapter by the order of revelation (after Al-Mu'minoon), while the Nöldeke Chronology (by the orientalist Theodor Nöldeke) puts it as the 70th.


== Content ==
The first half of the chapter covers some of Islam's theological concepts, including revelation, God, creation of human beings, resurrection and the judgment day. The second half discusses the contrast between those who "fall prostate" before God and those who "turns away" from God's sign. The chapter then mentions the Children of Israel as an example of people who follow God's guidance through Moses.


== In hadith ==
A hadith narrated by Abu Huraira said that Muhammad often recited As-Sajda together with Al-Insan (chapter 76 of the Quran) for the early morning prayer (fajr) every Friday. This report also appears in Tafsir ibn Kathir. Another report said that he often recited the chapter before going to sleep.

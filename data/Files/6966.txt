Title: Topological K-theory
Aspects: {'K-group'}

In mathematics, topological K-theory is a branch of algebraic topology. It was founded to study vector bundles on topological spaces, by means of ideas now recognised as (general) K-theory that were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck. The early work on topological K-theory is due to Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch.


== Definitions ==
Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=\mathbb {R} }
   or 
  
    
      
        
          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }
  . Then 
  
    
      
        
          K
          
            k
          
        
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle K_{k}(X)}
   is defined to be the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional k-vector bundles over X under Whitney sum. Tensor product of bundles gives K-theory a commutative ring structure. Without subscripts, 
  
    
      
        K
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle K(X)}
   usually denotes complex K-theory whereas real K-theory is sometimes written as 
  
    
      
        K
        O
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle KO(X)}
  . The remaining discussion is focused on complex K-theory.
As a first example, note that the K-theory of a point are the integers. This is because vector bundles over a point are trivial and thus classified by their rank and the Grothendieck group of the natural numbers is the integers.
There is also a reduced version of K-theory, 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              K
              ~
            
          
        
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widetilde {K}}(X)}
  , defined for X a compact pointed space (cf. reduced homology). This reduced theory is intuitively K(X) modulo trivial bundles. It is defined as the group of stable equivalence classes of bundles. Two bundles E and F are said to be stably isomorphic if there are trivial bundles 
  
    
      
        
          ε
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{1}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          ε
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{2}}
  , so that 
  
    
      
        E
        ⊕
        
          ε
          
            1
          
        
        ≅
        F
        ⊕
        
          ε
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E\oplus \varepsilon _{1}\cong F\oplus \varepsilon _{2}}
  . This equivalence relation results in a group since every vector bundle can be completed to a trivial bundle by summing with its orthogonal complement. Alternatively, 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              K

        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widetilde {K}}(X)}
   can be defined as the kernel of the map 
  
    
      
        K
        (
        X
        )
        →
        K
        (
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        )
        ≅
        
          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle K(X)\to K(x_{0})\cong \mathbb {Z} }
   induced by the inclusion of the base point x0 into X.
K-theory forms a multiplicative (generalized) cohomology theory as follows. The short exact sequence of a pair of pointed spaces (X, A)

  Negative indices are chosen so that the coboundary maps increase dimension.
It is often useful to have an unreduced version of these groups, simply by defining:

  
    
      
        
          K
          
            −
            n

        X
        )
        =
        
          
            
              
                K
                ~
              
            
          
          
            −
            n
          
        
        (
        
          X
          
            +
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle K^{-n}(X)={\widetilde {K}}^{-n}(X_{+}).}
  Here 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            +
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{+}}
   is 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   with a disjoint basepoint labeled '+' adjoined.Finally, the Bott periodicity theorem as formulated below extends the theories to positive integers.

   is an isomorphism.The equivalent of the Steenrod operations in K-theory are the Adams operations. They can be used to define characteristic classes in topological K-theory.The Splitting principle of topological K-theory allows one to reduce statements about arbitrary vector bundles to statements about sums of line bundles.The Thom isomorphism theorem in topological K-theory is

where T(E) is the Thom space of the vector bundle E over X. This holds whenever E is a spin-bundle.The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence allows computation of K-groups from ordinary cohomology groups.Topological K-theory can be generalized vastly to a functor on C*-algebras, see operator K-theory and KK-theory.


== Bott periodicity ==
The phenomenon of periodicity named after Raoul Bott (see Bott periodicity theorem) can be formulated this way:

== Applications ==
The two most famous applications of topological K-theory are both due to Frank Adams. First he solved the Hopf invariant one problem by doing a computation with his Adams operations. Then he proved an upper bound for the number of linearly independent vector fields on spheres.


== Chern character ==
Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch proved a theorem relating the topological K-theory of a CW complex 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   with its rational cohomology. In particular, they showed that there exists a homomorphism

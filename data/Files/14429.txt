Title: Fokker V.27
Aspects: {'V27'}

The Fokker V.27 was a German parasol-monoplane fighter prototype designed by Reinhold Platz and built by Fokker-Flugzeugwerke.
The V.27 was little more than an enlarged V.26 (prototype for the D.VIII) with a 145 kW (195 hp) Benz Bz.IIIb liquid-cooled inline engine. Once again, Fokker pursued similar aircraft with both rotary and inline engines. Fokker submitted the V.27 at the second fighter competition at Adlershof in May/June 1918.

The V.37 was a ground-attack variant of the V.27. It was fitted with extensive armor plating to protect the pilot and engine. Neither the V.27 nor the V.37 were placed in production.

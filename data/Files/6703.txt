Title: ICD-10 Chapter X: Diseases of the respiratory system
Aspects: {'J38'}

ICD-10 is an international statistical classification used in health care and related industries.
Produced by the World Health Organization, it is used in several countries around the world. Some have gone on to develop their own national enhancements, building off the international version of the classification.
Chapter X of ICD-10 deals with conditions effecting the respiratory system. Examples of conditions captured using codes from Chapter X include; flu, asthma, and respiratory failure.

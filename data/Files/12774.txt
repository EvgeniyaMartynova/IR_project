== Species ==
The number of species in the genus is subject to change.


=== 1980s ===
Ingram's Squirrel, Sciurus ingrami (subg. Guerlinguetus) ⇒ Brazilian squirrel
Kaibab squirrel Sciurus kaibabensis (subg. Otosciurus) ⇒ Abert's squirrel


=== 2005 ===
In 2005 Thorington & Hoffman accepted 28 species in the genus; this is the taxonomic interpretation followed by the IUCN website (most squirrel assessments were written in 2008, despite all most being dated 2016/2017):

=== 2015 ===
In 2015, 15–17 species were left in the genus Sciurus after de Vivo & Carmignotto comprehensively reviewed South American Sciuridae for the first time in many decades and proposed numerous changes; synonymising some species and many subspecies, splitting another species, and naming new species. They followed Joel Asaph Allen's unsatisfying 1914 attempt in the early 20th century in splitting the genus Sciurus by raising the South American subgenera to the rank of genus, adding Urosciurus to Hadrosciurus, and splitting the genus Guerlinguetus in three. Their taxonomic treatment might also require Sciurus deppei to be moved to Notosciurus:
Genus Guerlinguetus
Brazilian squirrel (Guianan squirrel), Yellow-throated squirrel ⇒ Guerlinguetus aestuans, Guerlinguetus brasiliensis
Genus Hadrosciurus
Junín red squirrel ⇒ Hadrosciurus pyrrhinus
Northern Amazon red squirrel, Fiery squirrel ⇒ Hadrosciurus igniventris
Southern Amazon red squirrel ⇒ Hadrosciurus spadiceus
Genus Notosciurus
Red-tailed squirrel ⇒ Notosciurus granatensis
Andean squirrel, Bolivian squirrel, Sanborn's squirrel ⇒ Notosciurus pucheranii
Genus Simosciurus
Guayaquil squirrel ⇒ Simosciurus stramineus, Simosciurus nebouxii


=== 2017 ===
Calabrian black squirrel, Sciurus meridionalis (subg. Sciurus)

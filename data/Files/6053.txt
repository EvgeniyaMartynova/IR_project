== Reception ==
Jesse Caffey of scenestr said "Not only is she exceptionally talented with a hugely impressive vocal range, but she could easily go into comedy. Her dry sense of humour was genuinely hilarious and made for charming interludes between songs, as she explained the reasons why each track was included on the album and gave us a history lesson about her beginnings as a classically trained pianist."

The Oak Grove Cemetery is a historic cemetery, founded in 1854, which is bounded by Derby, Washington, and Grove Sts., and Maplewood Avenue in Gloucester, Massachusetts.  The cemetery was founded by a group of local businessmen who sought to establish a cemetery in the then-fashionable rural cemetery style.  They hired landscape architects Robert Morris Copeland and Horace William Shaler Cleveland to lay out a series of winding lanes.  The Bradford Chapel was built through a bequest by George R. Bradford, another local businessman, and built in 1903-04.  The cemetery is still privately owned, and has grown over time to occupy 11 acres (4.5 ha).It is the burial place of the operatic soprano Emma Abbott (1850â€“1891).The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

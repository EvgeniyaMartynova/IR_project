Title: Bathynomus giganteus
Aspects: {'B. giganteus'}

Bathynomus giganteus is a species of aquatic crustacean, of the order Isopoda. It is a member of the giant isopods (Bathynomus), and it is closely related to shrimps and crabs.It is believed to be  abundant in the cold, deep waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Its unusually large size has been attributed to an effect called "deep-sea gigantism", where crustaceans living in benthic zones and at higher latitudes tend to be larger and have longer lifespans due to an increase in cell size.They reproduce by laying eggs. Mature females develop a pouch known as a marsupium, where the eggs are stored until the young are ready to emerge as miniatures of the adults, known as manca, completely bypassing a larval stage.
Giant isopods are not usually fished commercially, although some can be found in the occasional oceanside restaurant in northern Taiwan, where they are boiled and served with rice.

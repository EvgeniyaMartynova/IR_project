The song is written in the key of A minor in common time with a tempo of 98 beats per minute. The song follows a chord progression of Am-C-F-G-Am.


== Music video ==
Rexha filmed a music video for the song, but it was scrapped due to its explicit content. She told a radio DJ, "It was actually too sexual so I had to get rid of it. It was too much," explaining further, "I have young fans. I like to be sexy 'cause I'm a woman now, but I still want to be a good role model." Rexha filmed later another version for the song in a desert setting. The music video directed by Dave Meyers debuted on January 6, 2017 on Bebe's YouTube account and has since reached over 284 million views. The outfits she wore in the music video were compared to those of Kylie Jenner by Billboard.

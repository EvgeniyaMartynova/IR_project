Title: ICD-10 Chapter VI: Diseases of the nervous system
Aspects: {'G36'}

ICD-10 is an international statistical classification used in health care and related industries.
Produced by the World Health Organization, it is used in several countries around the world. Some have gone on to develop their own national enhancements, building off the international version of the classification.
Chapter VI of ICD-10 deals with diseases and disorders of the nervous system. It covers conditions such as meningitis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and cerebral palsy. However; neoplastic conditions, such as meningiomas, are captured using codes from Chapter II.

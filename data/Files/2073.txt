Aspects: {'D band'}

D-A-D is a Danish rock band. It was originally named "Disneyland After Dark", but changed their name to avoid a lawsuit from The Walt Disney Company.


== History ==
In the early 1980s in Copenhagen, Denmark, D-A-D started playing together under their original name Disneyland After Dark. Pedersen came up with the name based on the idea that when the lights are out in Disneyland, anything can happen. The first lineup of D-A-D consisted of Jesper, Stig, Peter and Stig's girlfriend, Lene Glumer. The band's debut concert was at the youth club Sundby Algaard. In December 1982, Lene Glumer left the band and the three of them kept playing together and on March 3. 1984 Jespers younger brother, Jacob joined the band at a concert at Musikcaféen in Copenhagen.The band released their first album, Call of the Wild in 1986.The group made their international breakthrough in 1989 with the record No Fuel Left for the Pilgrims on Warner Records, which was released on the band's fifth birthday. They achieved some airplay with the single "Sleeping My Day Away".The current lineup is Jesper Binzer, Jacob Binzer, Stig Pedersen and Laust Sonne.
The largest concert the band played as the opening act for the Böhse Onkelz on their farewell festival on 17 June 2005, about 120,000 people on the Euro Speedway Lausitz.

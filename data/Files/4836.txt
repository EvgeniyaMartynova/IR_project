Hemitripterus americanus, commonly known as the sea raven, is a species of fish belonging to the family Hemitripteridae, found along the Atlantic coast of North America.

The sea raven is quite different in body structure from other common sculpins. Members of the species generally grow to be 18–20 in (46–51 cm) long, although the largest on record was 25 in (64 cm). The most distinctive feature of the sea raven is its fleshy tabs along the head, ridged outline of the first dorsal fin, and rugged skin. The species varies in color, as it can be dark red, reddish purple, yellowing brown, or dark brown on top, although its underbelly is always pale.

Atlantic Coast of North America, southward to Chesapeake Bay; north to Anticosti in the northern side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, to the Strait of Belle Isle on the Newfoundland side and to the Grand Banks.

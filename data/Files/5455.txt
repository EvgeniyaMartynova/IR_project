After school, Mira Lobe wanted to study art history and German language and literature, but because she was Jewish, Lobe was not allowed due to the growing antisemitism. Instead she attended a fashion school in Berlin, joined a Zionist youth group and studied Hebrew.
In 1936 she emigrated to Mandate Palestine, where in 1940 she married the actor and director Friedrich Lobe. The couple had two children. Her first book, Insu-Pu, was published in 1948 in Tel Aviv. It tells the story of eleven children on their way to Terrania, where there is peace. They become stranded on a desert island where they manage to establish a perfectly working state.
In 1951 she moved to Vienna with her husband. There she published books in first a communist and later a socialist publishing house. In 1957 they moved to East Berlin. In 1958 she was awarded the Austrian Children's Books prize for Titi im Urwald (Titi in the Jungle).

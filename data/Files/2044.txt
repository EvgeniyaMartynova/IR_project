Title: Carinotetraodon imitator
Aspects: {'C. imitator'}

Carinotetraodon imitator, commonly known as dwarf Malabar puffer, is a species of pufferfish found in rivers in the Western Ghats of India. It resembles the closely related C. travancoricus. It can be distinguished from its congener as the males have brighter yellow coloration than males of C. travancoricus as well as lacking the iridescent blue lines behind the eye.  Females are less brightly colored and possess a fine speckling of black spots in place of the larger black blotches of C. travancoricus.

Aspects: {'Kaalam Maari Pochu'}

Kaalam Maari Pochu (transl.â€‰The times have changed) is a Tamil language film released in 1956 with Gemini Ganesan and Anjali Devi in lead roles. It is a remake of the Telugu film Rojulu Marayi.


== Production ==
The film was originally produced in Telugu with the title Rojulu Marayi by C. V. R. Prasath and directed by Tapi Chanakya.
The Tamil film was produced with entirely new cast. Dialogues and songs were written originally for the Tamil version.
The dialogues were written by Muhavai Rajamanickam who was a freedom fighter and (at that time) was the leader of the then united Communist Party of India. He was also a famous writer in Tamil Language. The film was shot entirely on rural locations with real-life farmers partaking.


== Plot ==
The story focuses social and economic issues faced by farmers in rural areas and intertwined with a love story. A money lender in the village surreptitiously grabs the lands of poor farmers after lending them money. The un-educated poor farmers lose their lands due to ignorance. Later, the son of a poor farmer, who is educated, bares the truth about the money lender and in the presence of the District Collector gives back the lands to the owners.
The dialogues and songs are written in such a way to promote social justice and equality.

== Soundtrack ==
Music was composed by Master Venu and Lyrics by Muhavai Rajamanickam. Playback singers are M. L. Vasanthakumari, Jikki, K. Rani, Thiruchi Loganathan, T.M. Soundararajan and S. C. Krishnan. 
Almost all the songs in the film were a hit. The song "Kallam kabadam theriyadhavane" sung by Jikki and group with Waheeda Rahman's dance was so popular that the tune was copied into some later films.


== Controversy ==
The song "kallam kabadam theriyadhavane (Yaeru pooti povaaye)" became very popular. Those days, the songs were recorded for gramophone records and released well before the films are released. Accordingly, this song also was released early. There was another film "Madurai Veeran"" released one month before the release of Kaalam Maari pochu. In Madurai Veeran, there is a song "Summa irundha sothukku kastam" that had the same tune as "Yaeru pooti povaye" song.
Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar was the distributor of Kaalam Maari pochu. He thought the Madurai Veeran song will jeopardize the success of his film. At first, he advertised something like "Do not be deceived by duplicates!". Then he filed a case against the producer of Madurai Veeran, Lena Chettiar that he has stolen the tune of his film song. A well renowned lawyer named V. L. Ethiraj appeared for Lena Chettiar. The Judge observed that the tune of the songs are based on folklore music and no one can claim a right of ownership to such folklore music. The case was dismissed.


== Box office ==
Like the Telugu film, this Tamil film also was a hit at the box office.

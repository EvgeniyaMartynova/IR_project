The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union was a textile labor union that was founded in 1914. J.P. Stevens & Co had a famous run in with the union, which was documented in the film Norma Rae. The Academy Award-winning movie Norma Rae was based on the real-life story of Crystal Lee Sutton. Sutton, who was a mill worker in a J.P. Stevens mill in Roanoke Rapids, NC, was fired after trying to unionize employees. Shortly after Sutton's famous "stand", The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) began to represent workers at the plant on August 28, 1974.

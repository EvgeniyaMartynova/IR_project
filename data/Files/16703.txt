Title: Z-Train
Aspects: {'Z Train'}

The Z-Train was the original name of a proposed passenger train service that would operate primarily on Union Pacific Railroad lines between Los Angeles Union Station, Ontario, California, and a new station to be built adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip, with a travel time of five to five-and-a-half hours. Amtrak last operated passenger train service to Las Vegas in 1997 on the Desert Wind. The train would offer an alternative to traveling on congested Interstate 15.

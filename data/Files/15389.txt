Title: X Factor Adria (series 1)
Aspects: {'The X Factor 2013'}

X Factor Adria is a Serbian version of The X Factor franchise. The first series started broadcasting in late October 2013. Even though the production is Serbian, auditions were held in Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia - making the series pan regional.
The series judging panel features Emina Jahović, Kristina Kovač, Kiki Lesendrić and Željko Joksimović. The auditions were hosted by Bane Jevtić with Sneže Velkov as a co-host. Una Senić hosted the spin-off series and co-hosted during the judges houses. After the first two episodes were aired it was rumored that Bane would be replaced by another host, but the producers denied it. On the night of the first live show it was announced that Bane would be replaced by Slavko Kalezić - actor and a contestant that was eliminated in the Judges Houses phase of the competition. Day after the first live show aired it was announced that Slavko would be replaced as well. On January 14, 2014, Ana Grubin revealed she will be new host, while Una Senić and Sneže Velkov report from the backstage.


== Selection process ==


=== Auditions ===
Contestants were able to apply via text messages and an online form on the shows Facebook page. During the Exit Festival a mobile audition booth was set up and people could audition before previously applying. All of the applicants needed to preaudition for the producers before actually auditioning in front of the judges. The pre-auditions were held from August 20 to September 2 in Budva, Skopje, Banja Luka, Sarajevo, Niš, Novi Sad and Belgrade. After seeing all the acts, producers select a number of contestants that will audition in front of the judges.
From over 8000 acts that came to pre-auditions, producers selected 300 that were put through to judges auditions. The judges auditions are held solely in Šimanovci where the producers, RTV Pink, have their biggest studios. These auditions are the first part of the auditioning process that is broadcast to the public. The auditions were filmed in front of a live audience.
These are all of the contestants shown during the auditions episodes:
Key:

     – Contestant was eliminated^1 Judges weren't satisfied with Irma's first song leading to her getting only one "yes" (from Željko). She went backstage and thanks to Željko (and audience) she was called back to the stage when she received four "yes-es".


=== Bootcamp ===
Bootcamp is the second phase of the competition. There was only one 90 minute episode of bootcamp which was broadcast on December 10, 2013.
All the acts that got a yes during the auditions came back and judges chose 80 of them to perform again and sent all of the other acts back home without them singing again. The 80 acts performed in ten groups of eight, each group performing a medley or a mash-up selected by the producers. Judges originally decided on the 25 acts to progress to judges houses, six from each category, except for the groups, where seven acts progressed - three of the groups consist of the acts that had previously audition as soloists. Even though it was announced that Kristina would have seven acts at her house, Mouse Miles signed a contract with a recording company and had to leave the competition, therefore the groups category had six acts, like all of the other categories, making the total number of 24 contestants that advanced through to judges houses.
Key:

     – Contestant was eliminated
     – Contestant progressed to the Judges' houses
     – Contestant auditioned as a solo artist, but progressed to the Judges' houses in a groupThe 24 acts that progressed to the judges houses:

=== Judges' houses ===
At the end of Bootcamp, it was revealed that the boys category would be mentored by Jahović, the girls by Lesendrić, the over 27s by Joksimović and the groups would be mentored by Kovač.
Some information about the locations of the judges houses were leaked and published via various tabloids. It was revealed that Kiki was assisted by Scott Mills at his judges' houses, Emina by Mustafa Sandal and Joksimović by Tony Cetinski. Jahović took the boys to Istanbul for vocal coaching, but the performances and elimination were recorded in Belgrade.


==== Second chance ====
At the end of the first Judges' houses episode it was announced that the public would be given a chance to bring back a contestant that was eliminated and therefore did not make it to their respective judges' final three. After the votes have been cast and counted, four acts with the most votes from each category will come back on the first live show, after which only one of them would stay in the competition alongside other 12 finalists.
On the second live show it was announced that it was a close call between Maid Hećimović and Aleksandra Sekulić, so the producers decided to bring them both back.

== Reception ==


=== Controversy and criticism ===


==== LGBT discrimination accusations ====
When Filip Fifi Janevski (born male) stepped on stage during the auditions she was asked by Kristina if she wanted to be referred to as a male or a female. After Fifi said that she wanted to be referred to as female, Željko asked how could he refer to him as a female when she is male. When Fifi's performance was over all of the judges gave him a yes, except Željko who said he was shocked and not sure what he made of the act. When commenting on the performance, Željko refrained from using either male or female sex when talking to Fifi. Željko also added he was not conservative which prompted Kristina to ask him "You aren't?". When voting, before giving a no, Željko said: "I don't like it. But you sing good.".
After the episode was broadcast, LGBT organisations were outraged and wanted Željko to apologize for the way he acted. Željko responded on Twitter that he doesn't think he did anything wrong and that everyone's entitled to their opinion. The producers have stated that there was no hate speech in the way Željko talked to Fifi.
The situation had minor coverage by websites outside the Adria region - including a community article on BuzzFeed and Huffington Post.


==== Aleksandra Brković's elimination ====
In week 7, when two acts were eliminated, production faced minor criticism from the public for eliminating Aleksandra Brković without giving her a chance to sing for survival. After the voting lines have been closed for that night, Ana Grubin said that two acts would leave the competition, instead of one, without previously announcing the change of the rules. When bottom three were revealed, Ana announced that Aleksandra had the fewest votes and would leave without singing again. When the other two acts performed and judges had to vote which one would stay, some of the judges commented that they thought it was not fair for Aleksandra to leave without being given a chance to fight for her place in the competition.
In the days that followed, a lot of Aleksandra's supporters said that their votes did not get through, or got through after the voting lines were closed. Joksimović also tweeted that he received a lot of complaints from people who had problems with voting that night. Soon after that producers had a press release where they stated there were no problems with the voting lines and that the double elimination was previously used in the British version of the show and was not a thing they made up.

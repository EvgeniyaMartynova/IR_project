Title: WJYE (AM)
Aspects: {'WABK'}

WJYE (1280 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station broadcasting a 1960s-1970s oldies radio format. Licensed to Gardiner, Maine, United States, it serves the Augusta radio market. The station is owned by Lee L'Heureux and Pat Cerullo, through licensee MaineInvests LLC. 
WJYE is powered in the daytime at 5,000 watts, using a non-directional antenna. But at night, to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 1280, it reduces power to 400 watts. The transmitter is located off Northern Avenue in Farmingdale, Maine, near the Maine Turnpike. WJYE has a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission to establish an FM translator station, 106.3 W292FZ in Gardiner, which will simulcast WJYE.

=== Early years as WABK ===
The station first signed on the air on September 1, 1968. Its original call sign was WABK, owned by Abenaki Company. The station had a middle of the road format by 1971. It later moved to a full service adult contemporary sound. An FM sister station, WKME 104.3 FM, was added in 1974.Two years later, WABK shifted to a Talk/MOR format. In 1977, the station was sold to Tryon Communications, and talk programming was dropped. WABK became a network affiliate of ABC Radio. WABK began simulcasting with WABK-FM, which previously aired the Drake-Chenault syndicated format known as "Hit Parade." WABK returned to its own programming by 1984.


=== WQZN and WFAU ===
The station's call letters were changed to WQZN in 1987. However, the WABK call sign returned one year later. WABK switched to an adult contemporary format that was largely simulcast with WABK-FM, although the AM station incorporated some of its own news programming.In 1994, the station took the WFAU call sign and adult standards format, moved over from 1340 AM, which then became WMDR. WFAU had broadcast at 1340 AM since October 2, 1946.

== Background ==
Hoodoo Gurus had formed in Sydney in 1981 with Dave Faulkner the mainstay as songwriter, lead singer and guitarist. He was later joined by Mark Kingsmill on drums, and Brad Shepherd on guitar, vocals, and harmonica. In 1988 Richard Grossman (ex Matt Finish, Divinyls) replaced Clyde Bramley on bass guitar. The most stable line-up of Faulkner, Grossman, Kingsmill, and Shepherd saw Hoodoo Gurus from 1988 to their hiatus in January 1998.After the first album under their new contract, Magnum Cum Louder they recorded 1991's Kinky, which peaked at No. 172 on the American Billboard 200 album charts. It provided the single "Miss Freelove '69" which reached No. 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and No. 3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1991. Another single of the same year "1000 Miles Away" reached No. 37 in Australia. It was adopted by the crew of Royal Australian Navy frigate HMAS Canberra as their 'anthem' in 1993, playing it whenever they left port. Hoodoo Gurus played a concert, including "1000 Miles Away", on-board HMAS Canberra during its last voyage prior to decommissioning in 2005; coincidentally, Dave Faulkner's father is a World War II veteran who survived the sinking of the original Canberra. After releasing Kinky the band then released two compilations at once in 1992, Electric Soup,  which contained the band's hits and Gorilla Biscuit, which was made up of B-sides and rarities.
Faulkner had had long hair between 1985 and 1991; during the recording sessions for this album he switched to a buzzcut, retaining this look for the rest of his career.

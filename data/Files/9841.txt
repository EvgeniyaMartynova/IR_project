Title: Douglas O-2
Aspects: {'O8'}

The Douglas O-2 was a 1920s American observation aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company.


== Development ==
The important family of Douglas observation aircraft sprang from two XO-2 prototypes, the first of which was powered by the 420 hp (313 kW) Liberty V-1650-1 V-engine and test-flown in the autumn of 1924. The second XO-2 was powered by the 510 hp (380 kW) Packard 1A-1500 Vee engine, which proved unreliable. The US Army ordered 45 O-2 production aircraft in 1925, these retaining the XO-2's welded steel tube fuselage, wooden wings and overall fabric covering but at the same time introducing aluminum panels on the forward fuselage. The XO-2 had been flown with short and long-span wings, the latter giving improved handling and therefore being specified for the production aircraft. The fixed tailskid landing gear included a main unit of the divided type, the horizontal tail surface was strut braced, and the engine was cooled by a tunnel radiator.The O-2 proved to be a conventional but very reliable biplane which soon attracted orders for 25 more aircraft: 18 O-2A machines equipped for night flying and six O-2B dual-control command aircraft for the US Army, plus one civil O-2BS modified specially for James McKee, who made a remarkable trans-Canada flight in September 1926. In 1927 the O-2BS was adapted as a three-seater with a radial engine.The O-2Hs were an entirely new design but continued the same basic model number. Major differences were heavily staggered wings, a more compact engine installation, and clean landing gear secured to the fuselage.Up to 2011 there were no O-2's known to exist. However, in 2011 the wreckage of  O-2H 29-163 that crashed out of Kelly Field Texas on March 16, 1933 has been positively identified. The rear and central/forward portion of the fuselage behind the firewall, wing attachments and landing gear parts, tailplane and many engine parts and eight of the twelve pistons are now recovered. Research is continuing on this aircraft. It is known it was flown by Aviation Cadet Charles D. Rogers on a night recon advanced training mission. Apparently flying low, the aircraft hit a hill and burned after the crash leaving only the found wreckage today. Weather was not considered a contributing factor. Cadet Rogers was instantly killed in the crash by the impact. His body was recovered but the wreckage was abandoned due to the airframe and engine both being a writeoff.
The only similar aircraft known to exist are a restored Douglas M-2 mailplane and a follow-on derivative of the O-25 variant, an O-38.


== Variants ==
XO-2 
Two pre-production prototypes.
O-2 
Initial production model - 45 built.
O-2A 
O-2 with night flying equipment - 18 built.
O-2B 
Dual control version of O-2 - six built.
O-2C 
These differed from the O-2 in having frontal radiators for their Liberty L-12 engines and modified oleo-strut landing gear. The USAAC took delivery of 18 aircraft, while the remaining 27 went to reserve National Guard units - 45 built and one later conversion from O-9.
O-2D 
Unarmed staff transport versions of the O-2C - two built.
O-2E 
A one-off aircraft which replaced the wire link between upper and lower wing ailerons of production aircraft by rigid struts.
O-2H 
The fuselage was redesigned and a new tailplane was fitted, with staggered wings of unequal span. The O-2H incorporated the rigid-strut aileron interconnections of the O-2E. An improved split-axle landing gear was standard. The USAAC received 101 O-2Hs between 1928 and 1930, and the National Guard a further 40 - 141 built.
O-2J 
Unarmed dual control version of the O-2H for service as USAAC staff transports - three built.
O-2K 
A slightly modified version of the O-2J for US Army staff transport and liaison duties. 30 built for the USAAC and 20 for the National Guard - 50 built.
O-2M 
various export versions of O-2 that saw services with Republic of China Air Force. These aircraft were used as scout-bombers by the Chinese in the Second Sino-Japanese War with somewhat limited success against Japanese ground targets. It was also used by the Mexican Air Force with Lewis and Vickers machine guns, with very good results.
O-2MC 
Export version for China, powered by a Hornet radial engine - ten built
O-2MC-2 
Export version for China, with the Hornet radial engine surrounded by a Townend ring - 20 built
O-2MC-3 
Export version for China, fitted with an uprated 575 hp (429 kW) Pratt & Whitney Hornet radial engine - five built
O-2MC-4 
Export version for China - 12 built
O-2MC-5 
Export version for China, fitted with the less powerful 420 hp (310 kW) Pratt & Whitney Wasp C1 engine - 12 built
O-2MC-6 
Export version for China, fitted with the 575 hp (429 kW) Wright R-1820-E radial engine - 22 built
O-2MC-10 
Export version for China, fitted with a 670 hp (500 kW) Wright R-1820-F21 radial engine - one built
XO-6 
Five all-metal O-2s, built in the mid-1920s by Thomas-Morse.
XO-6B 
Radically altered (smaller and lighter) version of the XO-6 - one built.
O-7 
Three O-2s refitted with the 510 hp (380 kW) Packard 2A-1500 direct-drive engine. Two were later converted to O-2 standards, and one to the O-2C standard.
O-8 
One O-2 with the 400 hp (300 kW) Curtiss R-1454 radial engine instead of the intended Packard inverted-Vee engine. It later became an O-2A.
O-9 
One O-2 refitted with the 500 hp (370 kW) Packard 3A-1500 geared engine. It resembled the O-7 but had a four- rather than two-bladed propeller. It later became an O-2A.
XO-14 
One reduced-scale O-2H, with a 220 hp (160 kW) Wright J-5 engine, and the first Douglas aircraft with wheel brakes.
XA-2 
The 46th aircraft of the original O-2 contract was completed as an attack machine with the powerplant of one 420 hp (310 kW) V-1410 Liberty inverted-Vee engine, and with a total of eight machine-guns (two in the engine cowling, two each in the upper and lower wings, and two on a ring-mounting operated by the observer). It was remarkably well armed for its day, and competed against the Curtiss A-3 in 1926 but was not selected for production.
OD-1 
Two O-2Cs for service with the US Marine Corps from 1929.
O-22 
O-2H airframe with a swept-back upper wing and a Pratt & Whitney Wasp engine.
O-25 
O-2H airframe with a Curtiss Conqueror engine, and a revised nose. Later redesignated as the XO-25A 
O-25A 
Forty-nine production versions of the O-25.
O-25B 
Three unarmed O-25As fitted with dual controls. Used as staff transport aircraft

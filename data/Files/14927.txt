Title: W11 Opera
Aspects: {'W11'}

W11 Opera is an independent opera company in London which produces operas performed by young people aged 9 to 18. Founded in 1971, it takes its name from its location in W11, a postal district in West London consisting largely of Notting Hill and parts of Holland Park.
Almost all of the productions are new works created by internationally recognised composers such as George Fenton, John Gardner, Richard Harvey, and Colin Towns. Some of these works go on to be revived by schools and other opera companies.
Notable alumni of the company include Eve Best, Jonathan Antoine and Sophie Ellis-Bextor.


== Works commissioned and premiered ==
W11 Opera has commissioned and produced almost 40 new operas, more than any other UK company, providing a rich repertoire of music theatre for its cast of 9- to 18-year-olds. Each has a running time of just over one hour. Most of the group's commissions are available for performance by schools and music theatre groups. 

Note: * not a W11 Opera commission; + denotes commission revivals

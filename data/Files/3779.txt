Title: Hirth F-30
Aspects: {'F30'}

The Hirth F-30 is a horizontally opposed four-cylinder, two-stroke, carburetted aircraft engine, with optional fuel injection, designed for use on ultralight aircraft and homebuilts.


== Development ==
The F-30 is equipped with a dual capacitor discharge ignition system and is free-air-cooled, with optional fan cooling. The cylinder walls are electrochemically coated with Nikasil. Standard starting is electric start and recoil start is not an option. The reduction drive system available is the G-40 gearbox with optional reduction ratios of 2.03:1, 2.25:1, 2.64:1, 2.96:1 and 3.33:1. A centrifugal clutch is also available as optional equipment.The engine runs on a 50:1 pre-mix of unleaded 93 octane auto fuel and oil.

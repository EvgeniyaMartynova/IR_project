Title: Prix d'Arenberg
Aspects: {"D'Arenberg (disambiguation)"}

The Prix d'Arenberg is a Group 3 flat horse race in France open to two-year-old thoroughbreds. It is run at Chantilly over a distance of 1,100 metres (about 5½ furlongs), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.


== History ==
The event was established in 1911, and it was originally called the Prix des Coteaux. It was initially contested over 1,100 metres at Longchamp. It was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1914 to 1919. It was shortened to 1,000 metres in 1921.
The race was renamed in memory of Auguste d'Arenberg (1837–1924), a long-serving member of the Société d'Encouragement, in 1925.
The Prix d'Arenberg was cancelled once during World War II, in 1939. It was run at Auteuil over 900 metres in 1940, Maisons-Laffitte in 1943 and Le Tremblay in 1944.
The event was transferred to Chantilly in 1975, and it returned to Longchamp in 1983. It was extended to 1,100 metres in 1994, and from this point its venue frequently changed. For brief spells it was held at Maisons-Laffitte (1994, 2002–03), Chantilly  (1995, 1997, 1999–2001) and Évry (1996). It was cancelled because of budget cuts in 1998.
The Prix d'Arenberg moved back to Chantilly in 2004. It was staged at Maisons-Laffitte in 2010 and 2011 and Longchamp in 2015 over the shorter distance of 5 furlongs.

Title: General Electric J97
Aspects: {'J97'}

The General Electric J97 is a single-shaft turbojet engine designed and built by General Electric as a compact high-performance engine for light attack fighters and eventually a number of drone projects.


== Development and design ==
The J97 was based on GE's General Electric GE1/J1 series of turbojets and the engine development was financed by the United States Air Force. The original application was to be the Northrop P-530 (which later evolved into the YF-17), but it was ultimately only used in several small drone aircraft.

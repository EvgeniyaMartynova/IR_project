== Critical reception ==
The album received generally favorable reviews. Stephanie Kale from Exclaim noted, "The range of what Miss Kittin mixes truly reveals her talent for bringing disparate styles and rhythms together in a way that makes sense." Likewise, Scott Colothan from Gigwise.com said that "the main strength in this album is its sheer unpredictability and refusal to adhere to the build-up/release formula inherent to many live sets."

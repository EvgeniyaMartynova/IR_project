GMG Airline was established in 1997 and started domestic operations on 6 April 1998. International services were launched six years later on 8 September 2004, with a service from Chittagong to Kolkata.
GMG began regular flights to Bangkok, Delhi and Kathmandu on 20 October 2006. It started services to Kuala Lumpur on 24 January 2007.

In February 2008 the airline added a leased Boeing 747-300 to the fleet starting wide-body operations, this proved to be a White Elephant in an era which saw Global economic problems and an unprecedented peak in oil prices, thus causing a substantial loss to the carrier, the 747 was eventually phased out after just five months of service.
On 17 June 2009, the largest conglomerate of Bangladesh, BEXIMCO took a 50% stake in the airline, re-branding it and raising service standards to a higher level.On March 28, 2012, GMG announced they would suspend all operations in preparation for re-fleeting the airline.  It expected to resume operations later in 2013 but years later in 2019, this situation remains unchanged.In 2013, India provided a temporary maintenance and operational base at Kolkata. With no overseas assets, GMG international operations consisted solely of flights between Kolkata and Kathmandu in 2014. 
As of 30 May 2016, Sonali Bank said GMG Airlines owed the bank over Tk 2.28 billion. Sonali Bank attempted to have an auction of owner Salman F. Rahman's home, which was collateral for the loan.
According to CEO Sanjiv Kapoor "[GMG's] operations will be temporarily suspended with effect from Mar 30, as we await the delivery of new-generation aircraft, clear legacy issues, execute the rightsizing and organize ourselves better to take up the future challenges". GMG has stated it is planning to adopt a new business strategy in light of rising fuel prices and changing international competitive environment through a 360 degree restructure of its strategy, organization, fleet and business model. It will redesign its route network to focus on higher yield, higher growth domestic and regional routes using new generation narrow body aircraft.

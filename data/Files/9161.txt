Title: Night buses in London
Aspects: {'N20'}

The London Night Bus network is a series of night bus routes that serve Greater London. Services broadly operate between the hours of 23:00 and 06:00.
Many services commence from or operate via Trafalgar Square and are extensions or variations of daytime routes and hence derive their number from these; for example, route N73 Oxford Circus to Walthamstow follows that of route 73 as far as Stoke Newington, before continuing further north.


== History ==
The first night bus was introduced in 1913. A few more services were introduced over the following decades, before all ceased during World War II. Services resumed after the war, increasing as trams and trolleybuses were replaced in the late 1950s and 1960s. In April 1984, the number of routes was increased from 21 to 32. At this point the peak service required 80 buses, by August 2013 this had grown to 890.Originally the night bus network had its own fare structure, but with the introduction of the Oyster card in 2003, was incorporated into the Transport for London fare structure. Up until the mid-2000s, all routes had N prefixes. However, as some routes merely mirrored their day time equivalents, the N prefixes were dropped and these routes became 24-hour services; for example, route N14 was no longer differentiated from route 14.Services are operated by private operators under contract to London Buses. The Night Bus contracts are often bundled with that of the equivalent daytime route and awarded for a five-year period, with an optional two-year extension based on performance standards being met. Some however are tendered individually.With some London Underground lines operating a 24-hour service from August 2016 on weekends, a further eight routes commenced 24-hour operation on Friday and Saturday nights. Further changes were made as the Night Tube network expanded.
In May 2015, the Night Bus network was the subject of The Night Bus, a Channel 4 documentary.


== Operation ==
Night bus routes are often related to the day numerical equivalent, normally running the same route but with an extension at either end of the service. This is normally to provide a night service to destinations served by tube or train during the day.
However, there are a few N-prefixed route numbers that have no relation to their daytime equivalents: the N5, N20 and N97 all operate in a different part of London to their respective day routes, and the N550 and N551 (which provide night service on parts of the Docklands Light Railway network) have no corresponding daytime routes.

Night Bus Route N21 is the night service for route 21 between Bank and Lewisham, and - until 10 October 2009 - for route 233 between Eltham and Foots Cray, for route 51 between Blackfen and Foots Cray and for route 321 between New Cross Gate and Eltham and Sidcup (Police station) and Foots Cray.
The N21 was introduced to provide a night service over the original route 21 between Central London and Sidcup (Foots Cray), but with a deviation via Avery Hill and Blackfen, to serve the University of Greenwich, which provides the route with steady patronage between there and Central London (not just at weekends either). It originally operated from Victoria to Foots Cray via its current routing but on Friday and Saturday Nights some journeys ran via New Eltham and Mottingham, terminating at Sidcup. In 1999 the route was re-structured again with the extra weekend journeys via New Eltham being revised to operate from Eltham to Chislehurst via Mottingham and was introduced to run every night (not just weekends). The original service to Foots Cray via Blackfen and Sidcup remained unchanged. Changes to the frequency meant buses running every 30 minutes between Victoria and Eltham then every 60 mins to Chislehurst and Foots Cray respectively.
In 2002, another re-structure saw the Chislehurst Journeys withdrawn and run through to Foots Cray. Instead, providing a 30 min service over the whole route. The route was also shortened to start and terminate at Trafalgar Square as opposed to Victoria. On Friday and Saturday nights, patronage was such that extras were introduced between Eltham High Street and Trafalgar Square, combined with the Foots Cray Buses providing a 15-minute service over that section of route. With the withdrawal of the Chislehurst Services, Mottingham and Chislehurst were without a night bus route until Feb 2008 when the N136 was introduced (replacing parts of the N36).
The route was further amended on 10 October 2009, being withdrawn between Blackfen and Sidcup, instead running to Bexleyheath via Blendon, Bridgen and Old Bexley along the established day route 132. The Night service to Sidcup was simultaneously replaced by a 24-hour service on route 321, restoring a night service to New Eltham after an absence of 10 years. On 27 May 2017, the route was transferred to London Central.

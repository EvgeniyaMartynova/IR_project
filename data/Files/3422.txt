The increasing development along the links of Shah Alam and Jalan Batu Arang (Persiaran Mokhtar Dahari) facilitated the need of increasing road capacity. So, Prolintas proposed that the expressway to be built to meet these requirements. It would not only serve as an alternative route for Persiaran Surian in Kota Damansara and to the Subang Airport, but also act as a link between east and west of Klang Valley, thus crossing over the New Klang Valley Expressway, and linking existing expressways such as the Guthrie Corridor Expressway, LDP and SPRINT. In addition, the expressway will solve congestions to the existing routes caused by the development at the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia's land in the area.  The project was allocated RM4.2 billion in the Budget 2015.

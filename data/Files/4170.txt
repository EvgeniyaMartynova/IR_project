Title: The Whitey Album
Aspects: {'G force (disambiguation)'}

The Whitey Album is an album by Ciccone Youth, a pseudonymous side project of Sonic Youth members Steve Shelley, Kim Gordon, Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore, featuring contributions from Minutemen/Firehose member Mike Watt and J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr.


== Background and composition ==
Although it is suggested through only a few songs, the album is somewhat a tongue-in-cheek tribute to Madonna and 1980s pop in general. Contrary to many Sonic Youth albums, drum machines and samplers are the foundation of the recording, but Sonic Youth's trademark dissonance and experimental methods still permeate throughout. The album featured a new version of an early Sonic Youth song, "Making the Nature Scene".
Track 2, "(Silence)", is a titular one minute gap of silence intended as a tribute to John Cage.
Mike Watt's only contribution is a version of Madonna's "Burnin' Up," on which he sang and played all instruments.


== Artwork ==
According to the liner notes of the deluxe edition of Daydream Nation: "The album cover [of Ciccone Youth], a b&w xerox enlargement of Madonna's face, was a brilliant and contemporary design. Sonic Youth had employed found images on album covers before, but this was testing the limit. We sent copies of the vinyl album to Warners to be passed on to Madonna via her sister who worked in the art department there. Word came back that she had no problem with it acknowledging she remembered the band from her NYC Danceteria days".


== Reception ==
The album received generally mixed reviews from critics. Trouser Press wrote "the joke doesn't translate, and the disc comes across as a self-indulgent mess".

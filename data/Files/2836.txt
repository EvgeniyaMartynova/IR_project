Title: Pine flycatcher
Aspects: {'E. affinis'}

The pine flycatcher (Empidonax affinis) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae, the tyrant flycatchers.
It is found in the montane tropical and subtropical coniferous forests of Mexico and southwestern Guatemala. A vagrant bird found in the Santa Rita Mountains, Arizona, in late May 2016 is the first record north of Mexico. (An erroneous 2009 record from Choke Canyon State Park in southern Texas  was later shown to be a misidentified Least Flycatcher.)

Title: James O'Connor-John Trybowski Three-Decker
Aspects: {"O'Connor House"}

The James O'Connor-John Trybowski Three-Decker is a historic triple decker at 21 Canton Street in Worcester, Massachusetts.  When the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, it was recognized for its well preserved Colonial Revival styling, including porches supported by heavy square columns, and decorative brackets on the cornice.  It was built about 1914, and its first owner, James O'Connor, was a gasfitter, and its early tenants were Irish immigrants.  Since its listing, the house's exterior has been resided, removing the cornice decorations and enclosing the porches (see photo).

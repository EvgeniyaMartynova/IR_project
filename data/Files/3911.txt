HMS Bedouin was a Tribal-class destroyer of the British Royal Navy that saw service in World War II. She was launched on 21 December 1937 by William Denny and Brothers.


== Trials ==
During her trials Bedouin made 37.457 knots (69.370 km/h; 43.105 mph) at 372.4 RPM with 44,522 shp (33,200 kW) at 2,035 long tons (2,068 t).


== Service history ==

She served in the Second Battle of Narvik, where she was slightly damaged, and in the 1941 commando raid on the Lofoten islands. During Operation Harpoon, a large allied convoy to ressuply Malta, she was sunk by the combined action of Italian cruisers Raimondo Montecuccoli and Eugenio di Savoia and an SM.79 torpedo bomber on 15 June 1942. She was hit by at least 12 six-inch rounds and near-misses from the cruisers and an aerial torpedo before sinking. A gunner manning a .5-inch (12.7 mm) quad machine gun mounting shot down the torpedo bomber which delivered the coup de grâce. Twenty-eight men from her complement were killed in action and 213 were taken as prisoners of war by the Italian Navy.

Title: J8 (talk show)
Aspects: {'J8'}

Huitième Jour (Arabic: اليوم الثامن‎, al-Yawm ath-Thāmin), or simply J8, is an Algerian live talk show that debuted 2017 on Echourouk TV. It deals with the news of the week, focusing on media news.
It hosted by Farah Yasmine Nia, with a group of columnists, including Merouane Guerouabi, Zoubir Belhor and Chemseddine Lamrani.A casting was announced by Not Found Prod on November 3, 2016 (2016-11-03) to choose other columnists for the show.


== Concept ==
The idea of the show is simple: to see or to review striking pictures of the week in the best spirit possible and with good rhythm. But it's not a simple zapping because Farah Yasmine and her team of columnists discuss new or polemical happenings and events without forgetting the pictures to not miss, with some special headings. Two or three guests talk about their life and their favourite show during each J8 episode, and sometimes, it's an opportunity to do some type of challenges.

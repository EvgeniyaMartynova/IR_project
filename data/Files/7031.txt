== Improvements ==
Starting in July 2008, North Main Street was closed through downtown Kernersville. The improvements included widening the road and adding parking along the street. North Main Street was re-opened on October 2, 2008.
Starting in mid 2006, Century Park went under construction to rebuild the lake that had been drained years before due to a structural issues with its dam. The lake was restocked with fish and renovated, and the park is now accessible from Century Blvd with bathrooms and picnic areas. The project was finished in the Spring 2008. Beginning in May 2009 the public is allowed to fish from the lake.
Also, Century Blvd went under construction in the winter of 2008. The construction extended Century Place Blvd which allowed traffic from South Main St to Century Blvd. The construction was finished in January 2009.
The resident houses in the historical district on Salisbury St. were given an ordinance to renovate their homes to match the current renovations done to the roads leading into downtown along with the new bank and park added further downtown. The historical district includes the famous Körner’s Folly built 1878–1880, and the Harmon House.
In 2012, complete reconstruction of the Salisbury Street overpass bridge over B-40 business was completed. The new bridge includes stone side walls, sidewalks, and light posts.
In 2012, new landscaping was put into place around the Main Street exit and entrance ramps from B-40 business.
Beginning in 2012, construction began to replace the Hastings Hill Road overpass bridge to B-40 business. The project is focused around replacing the outdated bridge as well as making the northern part of the road leading to the bridge a straight shot over B-40 business instead of the winding road it currently is. The project may include additional benefits such as exit/entrance ramps to B-40 business. Such access would eliminate the large distance between the closest exits (S. Main St. and Linville Rd.) and provide easier access for motorists to surrounding areas of the overpass.
Beginning in Fall 2013, road construction began to incorporate a traffic circle to the intersection of W. Bodenhamer St. and Dobson St. The project is focused around decreasing the traffic congestion of the intersection around heavy traffic times. The project is estimated to complete in mid-2014.
Beginning in Fall 2013, construction began on the Macy Grove Road overpass bridge to B-40 business. The project has so far been focused around replacing the old bridge but may include additional benefits such as exit/entrance ramps to B-40 business. Such access would provide much easier access for motorists to the Novant Health Kernersville Medical Center, the areas biggest hospital.

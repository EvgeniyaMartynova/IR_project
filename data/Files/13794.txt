Title: United States Post Office and Courthouse–Billings
Aspects: {'U.S. Post Office and Courthouse'}

The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse–Billings, in Billings, Montana, was built in 1914.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.
It includes Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals architecture and Second Renaissance Revival architecture.  Also known as Billings Post Office and Courthouse and as Billings Downtown Station, it served historically as a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Montana, and as a post office. The courthouse functions have since been relocated to the James F. Battin U.S. Courthouse.
The building's construction was touted as a great thing for Billings, and its opening was a matter of great pride for the city.  The building was expanded and renovated in 1932.

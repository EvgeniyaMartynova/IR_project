Aspects: {'L. J. Rogers'}

Lesley Joy Rogers (born 31 July 1943) is a neurobiologist and emerita professor of neuroscience and animal behaviour at the University of New England (Australia).


== Education ==
Professor Rogers studied a Bachelor of Science at the University of Adelaide obtaining a first class honours in 1964. After three years as teaching fellow at Harvard University and research assistant at the New England medical centre hospital in Boston she studied for a PhD at the University of Sussex. Professor Rogers obtained her Doctor of Philosophy in 1971 and was also awarded a Doctor of Science from the University of Sussex in 1987 for the body of research accumulated after the completion of her PhD compiled in her thesis entitled for her thesis entitled "Neuroethological Studies of Brain Development and Behaviour".  During the mid-1960s, Rogers protested the Vietnam war, and this caused her to be "told to leave Harvard".  To avoid being deported, Rogers worked at the New England Medical Center Hospitals as a research assistant to Marshall Kaplan and they developed a technique for finding out whether a cancer might be in the bone or in the liver.


== Awards ==
Professor Rogers was made a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 2000, is also a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Biology and has been awarded many accolades including the Clarke Medal in zoology in 2003 from the Royal Society of New South Wales. She is the recipient of the Vice-Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Research, the Academic Women's Special Achievement Award and also the Centenary Medal in 2003.


== Professional activities ==
Professor Rogers is a member of the Voiceless Scientific Expert Advisory Panel 2009-.
Co-ordinator of the Centre for Neuroscience and Animal Behaviour at the University of New England (Australia).


== Selected publications ==
Professor Rogers has published over 200 journal articles and 14 books predominantly focussing on the brain and development.

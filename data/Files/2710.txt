Title: Chevrolet D-20
Aspects: {'D20'}

The Chevrolet D-20 is a pick-up truck that was manufactured by Chevrolet in Brazil and Argentina. When it was first launched, it could be ordered with a 4.1 liter gasoline or ethanol engine or a 3.9 liter Perkins diesel. In 1991, the Perkins was replaced with the Maxion S4 4.0L diesel (90 ps/88 hp) and the turbocharged Maxion S4T (125 ps/123 hp). In 1995, the S4T was readjusted to match the Euro-II emission limits, producing 150 ps/148 hp. This version was called Turbo Plus, and equipped with mechanical ABS in the rear. Whilst all models are commonly referred to as D-20, the gasoline model was marketed as the C-20, and an otherwise mechanically identical ethanol-fueled version as the A-20.
As well as single-cab and crew-cab versions, Chevrolet sold mechanically identical SUVs, called Bonanza (similar to the Tahoe) and Veraneio (similar to the Suburban).

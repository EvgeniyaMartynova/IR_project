Title: Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)
Aspects: {'D Line'}

The Purple Line is a heavy rail subway line operating in Los Angeles, running between downtown and the Mid-Wilshire/Koreatown districts. It is one of six lines on the Metro Rail System, operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The Metro Purple Line is one of the city's two subway lines (along with the Metro Red Line). Although they separate west of Downtown Los Angeles, the two subway lines (Purple and Red) were originally branded as two branches of the Red Line. The Purple Line was instituted as its own line, separate from the Red Line, in 2006. As of October 2013, the combined Red and Purple lines averaged 169,478 boardings per weekday.  Out of the eight stations served, only two of them are exclusive to the Purple Line, with the other six shared with the Red Line.
Beginning in 2020, the line will be renamed to the D Line while retaining its purple coloring.


== Service description ==


=== Route ===

The Metro Purple Line is a 6.4-mile (10.3 km) line that begins at Union Station. At Union Station, passengers can connect to the Metro Silver Line bus rapid transit line, and the Metro Gold Line. The Purple Line travels southwest through Downtown Los Angeles, passing the Civic Center, Pershing Square (near the Historic Core) and the Fashion District. Passengers can connect to the Metro Silver Line (both directions) at Civic Center Station. At Pershing Square Station, passengers can board the northbound Metro Silver Line bus at Olive Street/5th Street.  At 7th St/Metro Center Station, travelers can connect to the Metro Blue Line, Metro Expo Line and the Metro Silver Line.  From here, the train travels between 7th Street and Wilshire Boulevard (and briefly Ingraham Street) west through Pico-Union and Westlake, arriving at Wilshire/Vermont in the city's Mid-Wilshire/Koreatown district.  Up to this point, track is shared with the Metro Red Line: at Wilshire/Vermont, the two lines diverge.  The Purple Line continues west for one additional mile, and terminates at Wilshire/Western.


==== Duplicate service on Wilshire ====
The Purple Line runs underground, below Wilshire Boulevard which is served on the surface by Metro Local route 20 and Metro Rapid route 720.  Despite the duplicate service, Metro considers the redundant bus service justified because both bus routes run frequently from Downtown Los Angeles. Unlike the Purple Line, they run along the entire Wilshire corridor, west to Beverly Hills, Westwood and Santa Monica.


=== Hours of operation ===
Trains run between approximately 4:45 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. daily, with late night weekend service running until approximately 2:00 a.m.First and last train times are as follows:
To/From Wilshire/Western
Eastbound
First Train to Union Station: 4:41 a.m.
Last Train to Union Station: 11:42 p.m. (2:01 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights)Westbound
First Train to Wilshire/Western: 4:56 a.m.
Last Train to Wilshire/Western: 11:27 p.m. (2:12 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights)During the evenings Purple Line trains sometimes run as shuttles.  Passengers must transfer to a Red Line train at Wilshire/Vermont.  This will change once the Purple Line is extended to Westwood.


=== Headways ===
Trains on the Purple Line operate every ten minutes during peak hours Monday through Friday.  They operate every twelve minutes during the daytime weekdays and all day on the weekends after approximately 10 a.m. (with a 15-minute headway early Saturday and Sunday mornings).  Night service can range between 20â€“30 minutes.


=== Ridership ===
The Purple Line is utilized mostly as a downtown shuttle on its shared segment with the Red Line. The stub between Vermont and Western has a very low ridership. According to Metro Service Coordinator Conan Cheung, the stub is operating 11% full during peak hours, and even lower at other times.


== History ==

The current Purple Line is the product of a long-term plan to connect Downtown Los Angeles to central and western portions of the city with a heavy rail subway system. Originally planned in the 1980s to travel west down Wilshire Boulevard to Fairfax Avenue and then north to the San Fernando Valley, a methane explosion at a Ross Dress for Less clothing store near Fairfax in 1985, just as construction got underway, led to a legal prohibition on tunnelling in a large part of Mid-Wilshire. Instead, after some wrangling, a new route was chosen up Vermont Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard. However, a short one-mile branch down Wilshire from Vermont to Western was allowed to remain in the system.
The service currently designated as the Purple Line opened in two minimum operating segments:

MOS-1, which consisted of the original five stations from Union Station to Westlake/MacArthur Park, opened on January 30, 1993.
MOS-2A, including three new stations between Westlake/MacArthur Park and Wilshire/Western, opened in 1996.The Vermont branch began service in 1999. Initially, both branches were designated as part of the Red Line, but in 2006 trains travelling between Union Station and Wilshire/Western were rebranded the Purple Line for greater clarity.


== Extension to Wilshire/La Cienega ==

Metro is now aiming to complete the subway to the Westside.  The new project is called the Purple Line Extension (the project was previously called the Westside Subway Extension) and the first phase broke ground on November 7, 2014. Metro released the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) on March 19, 2012, and the first phase of the project (to Wilshire / La Cienega) was approved by Metro's Board of Directors on April 26, 2012. Notice to proceed was issued to Tutor Perini on April 26, 2017 for phase two from Wilshire/La Cienega Station to Century City/Constellation Station. Pre-construction has commenced. Metro is still attempting to obtain funding for phase 3 to Westwood/UCLA.In Beverly Hills, there was public opposition to the Purple Line Extension project, led by school board president Lisa Korbatov. The opposition existed because the project had planned to build a subway tunnel beneath Beverly Hills High School, and Korbatov, along with Beverly Hills residents, were concerned about student safety issues posed by such a tunnel. Korbatov gathered over 5,300 signed petitions to send to President Trump, urging him and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to withhold federal funding from the project. The subway project ultimately won in court, but Korbatov the school district sued in both state and federal court over environmental concerns for the project.

== Operations ==


=== Maintenance ===
The Purple Line is operated out of the Division 20 Yard (Santa Fe Yard) located at 320 South Santa Fe Avenue Los Angeles. This yard stores the fleet used on the Red and Purple Line. It is also where heavy maintenance is done on the fleet. Subways get to this yard by continuing on after Union Station. Trains make a right turn before coming to surface level at Ducommun Street, and then travel south to 1st Street where they enter the yard.


=== Rolling stock ===
The Purple Line uses Breda A650 75-foot (23 m) electric multiple unit cars built by Breda in Italy; these trains are based on similar vehicles that were built by the Budd Company for the Baltimore and Miami rapid transit systems between 1983 and 1986. Trains usually run in four-car consists during peak hours and two-car consists outside of peak hours. The acceleration for cars #531 and up is similar to that of cars used by the Washington Metro because they both use General Electric traction motors. The cars are maintained in a Metro yard on Santa Fe Drive near 4th Street alongside the Los Angeles River in Downtown Los Angeles.
In March 2017, Metro ordered new CRRC MA HR4000 railcars, some of which will operate on the Purple Line once the extension is completed.

Title: V24 (boat)
Aspects: {'V24'}

viV24 is the name of a one-design offshore powerboat designed by Ocke Mannerfeld. It is called V24 not for the engine configuration, which is a V8 by Volvo Penta (5.7L GXi), but for its 'V' bottomed hull and the supposed 24 feet (7.3 m) length of the hull. The actual length is 22.5 feet (6.9 m).
The V24s race primarily in Sweden and have previously raced in Norway and England. They also race with a different engine and drive in the United States.
The V24 is a boat for one-design racing, a type of racing that requires everyone to have the same boat and allows no modifications.
V24 is a high performance gulled-wing race boat. The power unit for this race boat is an inboard small block 5.7 litre V8 engine.
The boat is only 22.5 foot long and weighs 1450kg in race form and has a 350 HP engine. - giving an interesting power to weight ratio of 215 HP per ton.
The V24 runs with a full enclosed canopy and its own safety air supply with the crew sitting side by side secured by a five point safety harness.
These boats run on courses close to the shore providing both a visual and loud spectator experience.
V24's run one design race rules, with no modifications allowed to the boats or engines which makes the competition tight and spectacular.
These boats are fun, fast and very loud.

Title: Ferrari F140 engine
Aspects: {'F140'}

The F140 engine family is a series of 65Â° DOHC V12 petrol engines produced by Ferrari since 2002, and used in both Ferrari and Maserati cars. This engine was derived from the already extant Ferrari/Maserati V8.
In the Enzo Ferrari, it set the record for the most powerful naturally aspirated engine in a road car. The 5998 cc engine, designed for the Enzo, is known within Ferrari as the Tipo F140B, whereas the very similar Tipo F140C engine displaces 5999 cc and was designed for the 599 as the most powerful series-production Ferrari engine, a trend that has continued with the F12 and 812. This engine is also used in Maserati Birdcage 75th. For Tipo F140EB displacement was enlarged to 6262 cc and debuted in FF. Latest enlargement saw Tipo F140GA at 6496 cc and is now used in 812.

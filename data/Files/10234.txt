Title: Phaeolepiota
Aspects: {'P. aurea'}

Phaeolepiota is a genus of fungi in the family Agaricaceae. This is a monotypic genus, containing the single species Phaeolepiota aurea. P. aurea, commonly known as golden bootleg or golden cap is a mushroom found throughout North America and Eurasia â€“ often next to nettles.


== Edibility ==
Various cook books recommend the golden bootleg for its fine taste. Later studies have shown that the fruit body contains unacceptable amounts of both cadmium and cyanide compounds. Therefore, the mushroom is no longer considered edible. Cooking reduces the concentration of the cyanide compounds present, which might be the reason Phaeolepiota aurea was considered edible in the past.

Title: Black-rumped buttonquail
Aspects: {'T. nanus', 'T. nana'}

The black-rumped buttonquail  (Turnix nanus) is a small species of bird in the buttonquail genus.
It is found in open grassland through much of Africa outside the forested and more arid regions. It is resident in the central parts of the range but is a migratory breeder further north towards Lake Chad and the Central African Republic.
This species has a brown back, rufous chest, and pale belly, brown irises and a black rump. As usual for buttonquails but not for most birds, the female is larger and brighter than the male.  This species is shy and difficult to flush.

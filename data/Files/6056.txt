 Following his parents' divorce, he lived with his mother and stepfather, Thurston B. Macauley, a journalist (sometime London correspondent for the New York Times) in New York. After National Service in the Education Corps based in Gibraltar, he read English at King's College, London, but did not take a degree.His experimental novel, I Hear Voices, was published in 1958 by the Olympia Press, and his plays include Green Julia (1966), a witty two-hander in which two young men discuss an absent mistress, and Tests (1966), which collects surreal playlets written for Peter Brook's Theatre of Cruelty.Ableman lived in Hampstead, London in the United Kingdom. He was married twice: first to Tina Carrs-Brown in 1958- they had one son, then divorced; then to Sheila Hutton-Fox in 1978 until his death in 2006- they had one son.

Gentianella concinna is a flowering plant species, endemic to the Auckland Islands of New Zealand.


== Description ==
It is an annual plant with much-branched stems up to 12 cm (5 in) long. The leaves are fleshy and leathery, oblong-spatheolate to linear-oblong in shape, gradually narrowing into broad, flat petioles. The basal leaves are about 8–20 mm (0.3–0.8 in) by 3–7 mm (0.1–0.3 in) wide; the cauline leaves are smaller. The flowers are borne singly in the axils of the upper leaves. The corollas are red, or white streaked with red or purple, and are about 8–12 mm (0.3–0.5 in) long. The calyces are about one third the length of the corollas.

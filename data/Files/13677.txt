U.S. Bank Tower (also called 621 Capitol Mall) is a 25-story, 404-foot (123 m) building in Sacramento, California. The office tower is located at 621 Capitol Mall and was completed in early 2008. U.S. Bank bought the naming rights and 34,000 sq ft (3,200 m2) of office space.The building's architect is Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum, Inc. (HOK) and the general contractor is Hensel Phelps Construction.
The building has a series of LED screens on the top that seem to form a flowing river or waterway at night, with colors changing from light/dark blues to purples. They are easily seen since this building is the second tallest in Sacramento. This artwork was created by Michael Hayden of Santa Rosa, California, and is a companion to an LED installation in the lobby of the building by the same artist.

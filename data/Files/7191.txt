The Seoul Air Show is held annually in this airfield.
The base is used as a VIP airfield by the President of Republic of Korea and other VIPs and heads of state.


=== Construction of a Second Lotte World ===
On the survey conducted by Sisain Press, 86% of military pilots and air traffic controllers opposed the construction of a second Lotte World because of a safety hazard. They were concerned that it would interfere with the flight path.
President Lee Myeong Bak (2008-2012) got the green light for a 555 meter tall skyscraper after rebuilding the airfield to deviate from the 123-story tower in Jamsil, Seoul. The building now operates as Lotte World Tower, the tallest building in any OECD country.

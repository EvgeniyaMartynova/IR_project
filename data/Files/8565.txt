The species is perennial and have 20–50 centimetres (7.9–19.7 in) long culms. Both the leaf-sheaths and the leaf-blades have glabrous surface. The other features are different though; Leaf-sheaths are tubular and are closed on one end while leaf-blades are 1–2 millimetres (0.039–0.079 in) wide and are hairy as well. The eciliated margin have a ligule that is 3.5 millimetres (0.14 in) long. The panicle is linear, open, nodding, and is 3–12 centimetres (1.2–4.7 in) long with the main branches of the panicle are spread out. They carry 7–30 fertile spikelets.Spikelets are oblong, solitary, are 7–9 millimetres (0.28–0.35 in) long and are pediceled. They also have 2 fertile florets which are diminished at the apex. The sterile florets are also present in a number of 2-3, and are barren, cuneate, and clumped. Both the upper and lower glumes are keelless, membranous, oblong and have acute apexes.

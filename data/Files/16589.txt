The yazh' (Tamil: யாழ், also transliterated yāḻ) (pronounced yarl)is a harp used in ancient Tamil music which was the ancestor of modern-day veena. A closely related word yali (யாழி முகம்) refers to any structure, particularly front, that resembles the way the tip of stem of this instrument was carved into. The yazh was an open-stringed polyphonous instrument, with gut strings (narambu) with a wooden boat-shaped skin-covered resonator and an ebony stem.

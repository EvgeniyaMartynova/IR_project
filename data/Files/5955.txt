Title: I Found U
Aspects: {'I Found You'}

"I Found U" is a single by Swedish DJ Axwell featuring Max'C. The song was popular on the UK Singles Chart, reaching a peak of #6 in August 2007. The "Remode" version became popular among fans and was widely used as the radio version. The song is still one of Axwell's most recognisable hits. The "Remode" is virtually the same as the "Vocal Remode" but is slightly longer and features slightly altered vocals. The Classic Mix, on the other hand, is based on a sample of the 1982 reggae song "Natural Collie" by Freddie McGregor.In 2010, it was included on the Swedish House Mafia mix album, Until One (whom Axwell was a member of).

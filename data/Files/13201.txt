Title: Tristramella intermedia
Aspects: {'T. intermedia'}

Tristramella intermedia is an extinct species of fish in the family Cichlidae. It was endemic to Lake Hula in northern Israel.  This taxon was considered to be a subspecies of T. simonis in FishBase and considered a synonym of T. simonis by Catalog of Fishes, a view with which FishBase now concurs. This species reached a length of 22.9 centimetres (9.0 in) TL.The deliberate draining of Lake Hula in the 1950s led to the extinction of this species, along with the cyprinid fish Acanthobrama hulensis.

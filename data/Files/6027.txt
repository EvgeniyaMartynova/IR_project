Title: I Got U
Aspects: {'I Got You'}

"I Got U" is a song by British record producer Duke Dumont, and features fellow record producer Jax Jones. It was released as the second single from his forthcoming debut studio album on 16 March 2014. The song topped the UK Singles Chart. It features on his EP EP1, which was released in North America. It also appears on the compilation album Now 87 and in the video game Forza Horizon 2.


== Background and release ==
The song interpolates vocals from session singer Kelli-Leigh's performance of "My Love Is Your Love". Dumont was inspired by the original recording of that song by Whitney Houston, saying: "It's one of my favourite Whitney songs, especially the latter Whitney period."In April 2014, Dumont explained his process of making the song:

I tend to make summery songs in the winter and winter songs in the summer, I'm like that typical British person that in the winter that moans that it's too cold and in the summer I moan that it's too hot, so the studio is my escapism. There was no master plan like 'hey I'm a gonna make a summer song and then build a buzz around it in January' – there wasn't much thought process to it!
It was released in the United Kingdom on 16 March 2014 on Blasé Boys Club and Virgin EMI Records. A remix EP was released on the same day containing remixes of the song by MK, Tensnake, Jonas Rathsman, Bondax and High Contrast.

The song was first aired on Annie Mac's Radio 1 show on 6 December 2013. She replayed the record halfway through because she couldn't get enough of it.


== Music video ==
A music video was created for the single and was directed by Rémy Cayuela. Starring the model and actor Rique and New Zealand model Kylee Tan, the video was released on 19 February 2014, and was filmed in Thailand in locations between Bangkok and Phuket. Critical reception for it was positive; Capital Xtra noted that the video contained "all the experiences you'd expect someone to have whilst travelling to that part of the globe, including beach parties, boat rides and bonfires". GQ magazine commended it for containing, in their words, "all the tropical trimmings: turquoise waters, infinity pools, freshly sliced watermelon, a beachside rave, bungee jumps, inquisitive monkeys and an abundance of models in neon two-pieces" and noted that its only drawback is that it caused cravings for coconut drinks, an extended holiday and a game of beach volleyball.


== Critical reception ==
Critical reception for the single was overwhelmingly positive. Robert Copsey praised the track for containing "all the summertime essentials: steel drums, Balearic synths and a myriad of earworm hooks" and noted that its choice of sample was "brave" but "sensitive enough that the essence of the original isn't lost". He also commended the vocal delivery of Kelli Leigh, describing it as "at times ... hauntingly similar to Whitney's". Lacy Kelly said that the song created a "calming vibe with a low steady beat, weaving piano between steel drums and Kelli Leigh's beautiful voice". In addition, Beatsmedia.com's William Michael called it "perfect for those laid back Balearic moments. Containing a cool laid back vibe, sweet piano chords and calypso rhythms "I Got U" has summer vibes written all over it and it when that unmistakable Whitney vocal comes in that you know this is one special record indeed". Jamieson Cox of Pitchfork called the song, "a blast of sunlight and warm, humid air, flecks of steel drum, vocal samples, and a joyous, radiant vocal take."


== Chart performance ==
It reached number 16 on Belgium's Ultratop charts and number 64 on the Netherlands' MegaCharts. However, the song performed the best in the United Kingdom, topping their Official Charts.

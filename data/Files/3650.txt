Title: Scania Air Force Wing
Aspects: {'F10'}

Scania Air Force Wing (Swedish: Skånska flygflottiljen), also F 10 Ängelholm, or simply F 10, is a former Swedish Air Force wing with the main base located in southernmost Sweden.


== History ==
The tenth air force wing initially started as a detachment located at Svea Air Force Wing (F 8) during the summer of 1940 but was relocated to Bulltofta Airport near Malmö on October 1, 1940 to deter foreign aircraft during the war. The first aircraft were two squadrons of older J 8's from Svea Air Force Wing (F 8) wing which served for only one year until they were replaced by three squadrons of the J 20's.
In 1941, it was decided to transfer the wing to a new base at Barkåkra near Ängelholm. In 1945 the wing was completely transferred and equipped with J 22 fighters. However, the grass field was too soft and full flight operations could not be undertaken until 1947 when one runway was paved.
In 1949 the squadrons replaced the J 22s with J 21R jets which only served two years until being replaced by J 28B in 1951. These also only served for two years until in turn being replaced by the J 29 which served until 1963.
While waiting for the new J 35, two of the squadrons replaced their J 29s with J 34 from Södertörn Air Force Wing (F 18) until the wing was fully converted in 1969. The J 35 served F 10 for a total of 34 years across several upgrades until they were replaced initially by the AJS 37 in one squadron in 1993 and then the JAS 39 in the two remaining squadrons in 1999.
In 1996, the duty of basic flying training for the Swedish Air Force was transferred from the Swedish Air Force Flying School (F 5) to F 10 together with one squadron of SK 60 trainers.
The wing was decommissioned on December 31, 2002 as a result of the disarmament policies set forward in the Defence Act of 2000. The two squadrons of JAS 39 were transferred to Blekinge Air Force Wing (F 17) and the flight school along with their SK 60 squadron was transferred to Uppland Air Force Wing (F 16).
The premises are currently owned by the construction company PEAB. Koenigsegg Automotive has their factories and office located in former F10 buildings. The F10 first squadron's 'ghost' is also placed on all Koenigsegg cars. The flight museum of Ängelholm is also located on the premises.

=== Colours, standards and guidons ===
The colour was presented to the wing at F 8 Barkarby by His Majesty the King Gustaf V on 17 September 1943. It was handed over to Blekinge Air Force Wing (F 17) as a traditional colour when F 10 was disbanded on 31 December 2002. The colour is drawn by Brita Grep and embroidered by hand in insertion technique by the company Libraria. Blazon: "On blue cloth in the centre the badge of the Air Force; a winged two-bladed propeller under a royal crown proper, all in yellow. In the first corner the provincial badge of Skåne; an erazed yellow head of a griffin with an open crown, armed red."

== Commanding officers ==
From 1940 to 1974, the commanding officers was referred to as flottiljchef ("wing commander") and had the rank of lieutenant colonel for the first two years. From 1942, the commanding officer had the rank of colonel. From 1974 to 1994, the wing commander was referred to as sektorflottiljchef ("sector wing commander") and had the rank of colonel 1st class. From 1994 to 2002, the commanding officer was again referred to as flottiljchef ("wing commander"), and had the rank of colonel.


=== Corps, wing and sector wing commanders ===


=== Deputy sector wing commanders ===
In order to relieve the sector wing commander, a deputy sector wing commander position was added in 1974. Its task was to lead the unit procurement, a task largely similar to the old wing commander position. Hence he was also referred to as flottiljchef ("wing commander"). The deputy sector wing commander had the rank of colonel. On 30 June 1994, the deputy sector wing commander position was terminated.

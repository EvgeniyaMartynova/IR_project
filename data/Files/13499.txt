== History ==
Uline was founded in 1980 by Liz and Richard Uihlein. After recognizing a local need for a shipping supply distributor, the Uihleins started Uline from their basement. The company's first product was the H-101 carton sizer. It sold well and encouraged the Uihleins to add more products to the catalog the following year.


== Information ==
In 2014, the privately held company was estimated to have $2 billion in revenue and has more than 6,000 employees. Liz Uihlein is reported to be more active in the company than her husband. The Uihleins' son, Brian, also works for Uline. The company requires men to wear ties; tattoos are discouraged. The company is not believed to have a communications department and maintains a low profile on social media, but does advertise extensively online. Liz's letters in the catalog sometimes have a political message.

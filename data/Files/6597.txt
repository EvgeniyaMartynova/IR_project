== Chromatic ==
The J12 Chromatic dress dive watch is available in 33mm quartz, and 38 and 41mm automatic. The movement of the J12 Chromatic is the tracteur ETA 2892, a resilient, accurate, easy to service, and thin watch movement which is the base for watches  of other brands such as the Omega 1120 and IWC 30110. The titanium-infused ceramic is extremely strong and scratch-resistant. The hands are rhodium-plated for finish and corrosion resistance. It is dive rated to a 200m rating, meaning it is suitable for professional marine activity and skin diving, but not rated for scuba diving.

The J12 Ganse   has a white gold 38mm case and bracelet  set with baguette-cut diamonds and rubies. The   crown is topped  with one round diamond.

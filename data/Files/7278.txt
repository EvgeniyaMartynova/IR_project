Title: K-38 (Kansas highway)
Aspects: {'K38'}

K-38 was a Kansas state highway that started at K-15 north of Dexter in rural Cowley County. It was 12.9-mile-long (20.8 km), ending in Chautauqua County at an intersection with a county road. There were no towns or state facilities served by the road. K-38 was never completely paved; the last couple of miles of the road were gravel.
K-38 was decommissioned in November 1997. It is now a county road for both Cowley (CR-28) and Chautauqua (Ranch Road).


== Route description ==
K-38 began at a wye intersection with K-15, which headed west toward Winfield and south toward Dexter, in central Cowley County. The highway headed east as a low-grade bituminous surface road with crossings of Grouse Creek, a tributary of the Arkansas River, and Bullington Creek. K-38 veered away from the east–west section line around its crossing of Otter Creek and returned before the route reached the Cowley–Chautauqua county line. The highway became a gravel road on entering Chautauqua County. K-38 continued east 2 miles (3.2 km) to its end at a junction of section line roads, east–west Ranch Road and north–south Road 2, near the Caney River in northwestern Chautauqua County; the nearest city to the highway's terminus is Grenola in southwestern Elk County, and the closest city in the county was Cedar Vale to the south.

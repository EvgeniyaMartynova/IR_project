Title: Entada gigas
Aspects: {'E. gigas'}

Entada gigas, commonly known as the monkey-ladder, sea bean, c≈ìur de la mer  or sea heart, is a species of flowering liana in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is native to Central America, the Caribbean, northern South America, and Africa.  It is notable for having the family's largest seedpods, which measure 12 cm (4.7 in) across and can reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in length. Inside the pods are ten to fifteen seeds, each of which have a diameter of 6 cm (2.4 in) and a thickness of 2 cm (0.79 in).  The seeds contain a hollow cavity, which gives them buoyancy.  After being washed by rain into rivers and then the ocean, the seeds of E. gigas drift long distances on ocean currents.  Seed buoyancy and vitality lasts at least two years.

Title: I Go Crazy (Paul Davis song)
Aspects: {'I Go Crazy'}

"I Go Crazy" is a song written, composed, and recorded by American singer-songwriter Paul Davis. It was the first single he released from his 1977 album Singer of Songs: Teller of Tales, and his second-highest peaking pop hit, peaking at #7 on the Billboard chart in 1978. The song entered the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart on 27 August 1977 and began slowly climbing, peaking in March and April 1978, before dropping off the chart the week after 27 May 1978.  Overall, it spent 40 weeks (nine months and one week) on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, setting what was then the record for the longest run on that chart, of consecutive weeks or not.During the March 4, 1978 American Top 40 show, Casey Kasem said that Davis begged his studio to have the song presented to Lou Rawls, who he thought would make it a huge success but, when the studio saw how much faith he had in the chances of the song's success, it decided to release a lightly edited version of Davis' studio demo version.

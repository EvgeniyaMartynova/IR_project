Title: Type C submarine
Aspects: {'C-class submarine'}

The Cruiser submarine Type-C (巡潜丙型潜水艦, Junsen Hei-gata sensuikan) was one of the first classes of submarine in the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) to serve during the Second World War. Type-C submarines were better armed than the Type-A and Type-B. The Type-Cs were also utilized as Kō-hyōteki or Kaiten mother ships, for this reason they were not equipped with aviation facilities.


== Class variants ==
The Type-C submarines were divided into three classes:

Type-C (丙型（伊十六型）, Hei-gata, I-16-class)
Type-C Mod. (丙型改（伊五十二型）, Hei-gata Kai, I-52-class)
Type V22B (第379号艦型, Dai-379-Gō kan-gata, Vessel number 379-class). However, the Vessel number 379-class was never built.


=== Type-C (I-16 class) ===

Project number S38 and S38B (Latter batch). They were based on the I-7 class. Eight boats were built between 1937 and 1944 under the Maru 3 Programme (Boats  44 - 48) and the Maru Kyū Programme (Boats  376 - 378).

=== Type-C Mod. (I-52 class) ===

Project number S37D. Twenty boats were planned under the Maru Tsui Programme (Boats 625 - 632) and the Kai-Maru 5 Programme (Boats 5141 - 5155). According to their Project number, they were one of the variants of the Type-B submarine. Seventeen boats were cancelled in late 1943, because the IJN was planning to build the Type E submarine (戊型潜水艦, Bo-gata sensuikan) which was to become the primary submarine in 1945.

=== Type V22B ===
Project number S49B. Twenty eight boats were planned under the Maru Kyū Programme (Boats 379 - 381) and the Kai-Maru 5 Programme (Boats 5156 - 5180). All boats were cancelled in late 1943, because the IJN was planning to build the Type E submarine (戊型潜水艦, Bo-gata sensuikan).

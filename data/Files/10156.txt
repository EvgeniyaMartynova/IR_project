Title: Proportioning valve
Aspects: {'P-valve'}

A proportioning valve is a valve that relies on the statics to supply a reduced pressure to an output line.
A simple example is where spring load applies a reducing force so that the output pressure is reduced. Proportioning valves are frequently used in cars to reduce the brake fluid pressure to the rear brakes.

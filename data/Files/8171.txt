Title: ISO/IEC 8859-10
Aspects: {'L6'}

ISO/IEC 8859-10:1998, Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 10: Latin alphabet No. 6, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1992. It is informally referred to as Latin-6. It was designed to cover the Nordic languages, deemed of more use for them than ISO 8859-4.
ISO-8859-10 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. Microsoft has assigned code page 28600 a.k.a. Windows-28600 to ISO-8859-10 in Windows. IBM has assigned Code page 919 to ISO-8859-10. It is published by Ecma International as ECMA-144.

ISO-IR 158 is an supplementary ISO 2022 graphical set, containing characters which are absent in ISO-8859-10, but which are required for writing Skolt Sami or historic Sami orthographies. It is intended to be used in an ISO 4873 profile for Sami languages, as a G2 or G3 set (i.e. prefixed with 0x8E or 0x8F respectively) alongside the main Latin-6 (ISO 8859-10) G1 set. The table below shows the additional graphical set.The code chart gives a symbol used in older orthographies to denote an aspirated consonant, usually written as a reversed apostrophe or raised left-half ring, the unusual name of "high ogonek".

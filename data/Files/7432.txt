Aspects: {'Kaan', 'KAAN'}

KAAN (870 kHz) is a commercial radio station located in Bethany, Missouri, and serving northwest Missouri and southern Iowa. The station broadcasts a sports radio format. KAAN is owned by Alpha Media and has a daytime-only license.  WWL in New Orleans is the 50,000-watt Class A clear-channel station on 870 AM, so KAAN must sign off at sunset to avoid interfering with WWL.  KAAN can also be heard on an FM translator station K279AP at 103.7 MHz. The translator operates 24 hours a day, even when the AM station is off the air at night.
The transmitter tower is located six miles west of Bethany on U.S. Route 136 at West 140th Avenue.KAAN is a network affiliate of ESPN Radio with some programming from CBS Sports Radio.  It also carries NFL games from the Kansas City Chiefs and MLB games from the St. Louis Cardinals.  It first signed on the air on December 3, 1983.

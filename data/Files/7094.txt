== Premise ==
Set in Chicago, Illinois, Kenan & Kel follows Kenan Rockmore and Kel Kimble, a pair of high school students who go on several misadventures, which usually occur as a result of Kenan devising a scheme to get-rich-quick, or avoid trouble from his elders. These schemes often foil as a result of Kel's aloof, happy-go-lucky nature.
The show employs a number of running gags. Episodes open and close with Kenan and Kel breaking the fourth wall by interacting with a studio audience, standing in front of a red curtain that is placed in front of the main set while they are still in character. A running gag of the openings is Kel never knowing what the night's episode would be about and Kenan refusing to tell him, while the closings frequently feature Kenan coming up with a new scheme, often asking Kel to get various assorted items and meet him somewhere. Frazzled both times, Kel exclaims his catchphrase, "Aww, here it goes!".


== Production ==
Kenan & Kel was created by Kim Bass, and stars Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell as the title characters. The actors previously starred in the Nickelodeon series All That. Mitchell and Thompson would joke around on the set of All That, which caught the attention of producers, including Bass, who wished to package Thompson and Mitchell in a series. During a hiatus of All That, the producers kept Thompson and Kel so they could film the pilot for Kenan & Kel. Mitchell later expressed fondness working with Thompson on the series. Kenan & Kel was Mitchell's second professional acting performance, having only worked on All That and in amateur theater productions in Chicago beforehand. Thompson's previous experience included a role in D2: The Mighty Ducks (1994). Kenan is the series' straight man, and Kel is his comedic foil.The first season contained 14 episodes, filmed between April and August 9, 1996. The season was filmed in front of a studio audience at Universal Studios Florida. With Kenan & Kel, Thompson and Mitchell were the first black stars of a Nickelodeon sitcom. The characters of Kenan and Kel make a crossover appearance on the Nickelodeon series Cousin Skeeter.

== History ==


=== 1919-1944 ===

K Line traces its origin to Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd, which itself was born in 1878, when founder and entrepreneur Kawasaki Shōzō (川崎 正蔵) established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo, Japan, which, eighteen years later, in 1896, was incorporated as Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd.
The shipping activities were developed when Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd. (predecessor of Kawasaki Heavy Industries)'s President Kojiro Matsukata, decided to develop shipping services so as to provide business to Kawasaki Dockyard and to serve Japan's national industrial and trade interests.To do so, he placed Kawasaki Kisen, Kawasaki Zosen and Kokusai Kisen under joint management to build a stronger fleet of 40 to 50 ships serving the Atlantic, North and South America, Africa and the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.
In 1921, the joint name 'K Line' was adopted, based on the initial of the three companies.
K Line founder, Kojiro Matsukata, was also known as an art collector. The National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo's Ueno Park was established around the core of Matsukata's private collection. In addition, the Tokyo National Museum houses his extensive collection of Ukiyo-eprints.In 1926, according to Lloyds, the newly established "K" Line reached the rank of 13th in the world, behind compatriots NYK (9th) but ahead of O.S.K. (14th).
By the end of World War II, Kawasaki Kisen had lost 56 vessels; 12 survived.
Prior to World War II, the holding company Kawasaki Heavy Industries was part of the Kobe Kawasaki zaibatsu, which included Kawasaki Steel and Kawasaki Kisen. After the war, KHI became part of the DKB Group (keiretsu).

During that vital recovery period, "K" Line steadily returned to the building and operation of ships, reestablished bases of operation around the world, increased earnings and took other steps to restore corporate strength and vibrancy of the company.


=== 1962-1967 ===
After the merger with Iino Kisen, "K" Line was newly capitalized at ¥9 billion and controlled a fleet of 104 ships, 55 of which were also owned by "K" Line. The merger gave "K" Line a solid foundation to advance dynamically into the future both as one of the world's largest shipping lines in terms of fleet size and as a well-balanced, integrated organization.

K Line opens International Transportation Service, a container terminal company in the Port of Long Beach.
The Car Carrier transport division was inaugurated with the launch of the new Roll-on/roll-off vessel Toyota Maru No. 10.

On 23 July, KESS car carrier Makassar Highway ran hard aground at full speed in the Tjust archipelago near Loftahammar, Sweden, causing an oil spill. By his own account, the captain had ordered a course close to land, far from established shipping lanes, in order to gain mobile phone reception. The ship's satellite communication system and black box were inoperable when departing Cuxhaven for Södertälje, and alarm systems had been disabled. The Swedish Coast Guard recovered approximately 7,000 liters of oil by 30 July, but thousands of liters of oil nevertheless washed up on the coast. An estimated 14,000 liters of oil were spilled. The ship was towed to Oskarshamn, where its cargo of 1,325 vehicles were offloaded. The chief mate was taken into custody and accepted a fine for intoxication and recklessness in maritime traffic. His blood alcohol content by mass at the time of the accident was estimated at 1.15 permille, based on samples taken after the accident. The oil spill is also being investigated as an  environmental crime.


=== 2019 ===
On 15 June 2019, car carrier Diamond Highway caught fire while sailing in between the ports of Singapore and Batangas.Philippines Coast guard was alerted, and a mission to rescue the 25 members of the Crew was undertaken by another car carrier sailing in proximity.
The ship had to be abandoned, and later towed to dry dock.
The reason why the fire broke out is unknown, but possibly related to the cargo on board.

Title: S Curve (art)
Aspects: {'S Curve'}

The S Curve is a traditional art concept in Ancient Greek sculpture and Roman sculpture where the figure's body and posture is depicted like a sinuous or serpentine "S". It is related to and is an extension of the art term of contrapposto which is when a figure is depicted slouching or placing one's weight and thus center of gravity to one side.  However, the S Curve involves more of the body than the contrapposto, and is therefore considered to be a more advanced technical development.
The "S Curve" concept was initiated by famous Greek sculptor Praxiteles, son of Kifissodotos.

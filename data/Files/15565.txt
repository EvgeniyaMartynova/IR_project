Title: N700 Series Shinkansen
Aspects: {'X0'}

The N700 series (N700系, Enu nanahyaku-kei) is a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed train with tilting capability developed jointly by JR Central and JR West for use on the Tokaido and San'yō Shinkansen lines since 2007, and also operated by JR Kyushu on the Kyushu Shinkansen line.
N700 series trains have a maximum speed of 300 km/h (186 mph), and tilting of up to one degree allows the trains to maintain 270 km/h (168 mph) even on 2,500 m (8,200 ft) radius curves that previously had a maximum speed of 255 km/h (158 mph). Another feature of the N700 is that it accelerates quicker than the older 700 series Shinkansen trains, with a maximum acceleration rate of 2.6 km/h/s. This enables it to reach 270 km/h (170 mph) in only three minutes. Further advancements led to the development of the N700A, an incremental evolution of the N700. N700A trains can reach 285 km/h on 3,000 m curves, allowing the maximum operating speed on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen to be raised to 285 km/h. All N700 series sets have been retrofitted with most of the improvements added to the N700A series, and are now classified as "N700A".
Because of these improvements, trains can travel between Tokyo and Osaka on a Nozomi run in as little as 2 hours and 22 minutes on the fastest service (8 minutes faster than before).
Currently, a second revision to the N700 series, the N700S, is undergoing testing and evaluation, with plans to begin replacing all other models from 2020.


== Operations ==
N700 series trains gradually replaced 300, 500 and 700 series sets on Nozomi services, and by the end of February 2009, the N700 series were responsible for 74 Nozomi services per day. All Nozomi through runs (over the full route between Tokyo and Hakata) were scheduled to use the N700 series exclusively by 2009. From the start of the revised timetable on 17 March 2012, all regularly scheduled Nozomi services, including runs limited only to the Tokaido Shinkansen, were operated by N700 series sets.Since 4 March 2017, the N700 is also used on regularly scheduled Hikari services during the day, as well as almost all Kodama trains on the Tokaido Shinkansen.
Since March 2009, the N700 series trains have been equipped with wireless internet available for use between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka.N700 series trainsets are also planned to run on the proposed Texas Central Railway high-speed line connecting Dallas and Houston.

== J sets "N700S" ==
In June 2016, JR Central announced plans to build a new prototype "N700S" 16-car trainset for evaluating new technology and features on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen lines from March 2018. Developed from the earlier N700 series design, the new train will incorporate a number of new features. Refinements to the ATC and braking systems will enable shorter braking distances in emergencies such as earthquakes. Optimized underfloor equipment layout will allow the same standard design to be used to produce 12-car and 8-car trainsets in the future in addition to the Tokaido Shinkansen 16-car trainsets. The optimization is intended to make the train more flexible for possible export. Green cars will use active suspension to further improve ride quality, and ordinary-class cars will have AC power outlets for each seat.A 16-car prototype set (J0), assembled at the Nippon Sharyo Toyokawa plant, was unveiled at Hamamatsu depot on 10 March 2018. Beginning from 20 March, this set has been used for testing and evaluation, with full-production trains expected to enter service on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen lines from fiscal 2020.High-speed trials at up to 360 km/h are planned to be conducted during 2019 on the Tokaido Shinkansen. This is 28 km/h faster than the fastest speed ever achieved by the N700A, and may indicate plans to raise the maximum operating speed on the line.

		
		
		


== N700-I Bullet ==
This was a proposed export version of the N700 series design announced by JR Central Chairman Yoshiyuki Kasai at an international high-speed railway symposium held in Nagoya on 16 November 2009. Nominally specified as an 8-car set with a maximum operating speed of 330 km/h (205 mph), the train can be configured in lengths from 6 to 16 cars to suit customer requirements.The same model is currently being considered in the developing Houston–Dallas Texas Central Railway.


== High-speed trials ==
On 16 November 2009, JR Central conducted a late-night high-speed demonstration run using N700 series trainset Z0, recording a maximum speed of 332 km/h (206 mph) on the Tokaido Shinkansen between Maibara and Kyoto. The high-speed run was conducted as a demonstration for approximately 160 international guests attending a high-speed railway symposium in Nagoya.


== Incidents ==


=== Fire damage and replacement ===
Car 783-2059 (car 1) of JR Central set X59 was scrapped due to fire damage sustained in an arson attack occurring on 30 June 2015. A replacement car with the same running number was built by Nippon Sharyo in 2016.


=== Discovery of cracked bogie ===
On 11 December 2017, Car 785-5505 (carriage 13) of JR West set K5 (a 16-car N700A built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries) was taken out of service at Nagoya Station after engineers confirmed an unusual burning smell. The smell was detected at Kokura Station, but was ordered by the operational centre to continue service until Nagoya which JR West later admitted was a "big danger". An on-site inspection revealed that the outer frame of the carriage had cracked and its underfloor carriage was leaking oil. It was the first "serious incident" involving any Shinkansen, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism reported that the train could have derailed had it continued on service and the carriage frame broke. An investigation by JR West implicated companies involved in the construction of the trainset, which included Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Electric. The investigation revealed that at least 100 out of the 303 Kawasaki-made bogies were substandard due to improper welding preparations, which caused the base material of the bogies to become 4.7mm in thickness, instead of the required 7mm or more. Following the events JR West is planning to gradually replace all the bogies that were provided by Kawasaki.


== Overall fleet history ==
The annual totals for the fleet sizes (number of vehicles as of 1 April each year) owned by JR Central, JR West, and JR Kyushu are as follows.


== Preserved examples ==

Aspects: {'Vaadhoo'}

Vaadhoo (Dhivehi: ވާދޫ) is one of the inhabited islands of Raa Atoll, Maldives.


== Geography ==
The island is 140.6 km (87 mi; 76 nmi) north of the country's capital, Malé.


=== Ecology ===
Vaadhoo island is famous for the 'sea of stars.' This marine bioluminescence is generated by phytoplankton known as dinoflagellates. Woodland Hastings of Harvard University has for the first time identified a special channel in the dinoflagellate cell membrane that responds to electrical signals—offering a potential mechanism for how the algae create their unique illumination.

Total population of island was more than 500 in 2007.

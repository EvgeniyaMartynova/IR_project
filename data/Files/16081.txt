Title: List of generation I Pokémon
Aspects: {'Y series'}

The first generation (Generation I) of the Pokémon franchise features the original 151 fictional species of creatures introduced to the core video game series in the 1996 Game Boy games Pokémon Red and Blue.
The following list details the 151 Pokémon of Generation I in order of their National Pokédex number. The first Pokémon, Bulbasaur, is number 001 and the last, Mew, is number 151. Alternate forms that result in type changes are included for convenience. Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced.


== Design and development ==
The majority of Pokémon in this generation had relatively simple designs and were highly analogous to real-life creatures including but not limited to: Pidgey (a pigeon), Rattata (a rat), Ekans (a snake), and Seel (a seal). Many Pokémon in the original games served as the base for repeating concepts later in the series.

Title: Pacewon
Aspects: {'I Declare War'}

Pacewon (born Jerome Derek Hinds Jr. August 23, 1978) is an American rapper and producer. He rose to fame in the late 90s as one of the prominent and founding members of the rap group Outsidaz along with fellow rappers Young Zee, D.U., Slang Ton, Az-Izz, Loon, Axe, Yah Yah, Rah Digga and others. The group would later make Detroit rappers Eminem and Bizarre of D12 honorary members of the group after they collaborated with members of the group.


== Career ==


=== Outsidaz ===
As a founding member of the Outsidaz, Hinds was one of the many MCs to gain a solo career after his group's appearance on the Fugees' successful The Score. With a smooth voice and a sly, clever tone, his raps were often relaxed and thoughtful amidst the large hip-hop crew's various styles. Despite the early solo attempts by many of his bandmates, Hinds waited until they had released their debut, Night Life, on Chris Schwartz's Rough Life Records. That, as well as guest appearances on records from Redman and Rah Digga, was enough to convince Schwartz to ask the MC for a solo record in 2002. With help from Wyclef Jean, Kurupt, and fellow Outsidaz member Young Zee, he put together Won, a collection of funky tracks courtesy of Jay-Z producer Ski that revolved around his charismatic voice and boastful rhymes. Later in the year, he collaborated with the UK trip hop act Morcheeba, who included the rapper on two tracks of Charango.


=== Solo ===
In 2004 Hinds releases his second album Telepathy via Detonator Records, co-produced by himself. After a string of infectious singles in the late 1990s, the meteoric rise of former crew member Eminem, and a few years of virtual absence, it seemed that the New Jersey underground rap collective Da Outsidaz would fade into obscurity. Thankfully, Hinds has met the perfect producer for his gravelly vocals and relentless one-liners: the up-and-coming Garden State producer, Mr. Green. On The Only Color That Matters Is Green, dropped in 2008, Mr. Green sets up Hindsâ€™ potent, punchline-heavy flow with a barrage of slick piano loops and soulful horn samples. Hinds releases his third solo album Team Won Inc via Ascetic Music / Modulor, where he collaborates with his former bandmate D.U. In 2012, Hinds once again collaborates with Mr. Green to drop their second album The Only Number That Matters Is Won via Raw Poetix Records. This record is also notable for collaboration with world-famous rappers such as Snoop Dogg and Masta Ace. In 2015, Hinds founds Team Won Incorporated and releases his fourth LP via his own brand new record label, cites the album as a group album introducing his group The Shady Corps.


=== The Shady Corps ===
The Shady Corporation also known as the "Shady Corps" is a rap group composed of Denton Dawes (Denzy), Robert Boak (S-Ka-Paid), Thomas Wlodarczyk (Miilkbone), DJ Scob, Ill Proceeja and Jerome Hinds himself. It is modeled after the "Marine Corps" and is also an Eminem tribute band. Honoring and celebrating real hip hop while carrying on the tradition set forth by Em of out spoken, witty, savvy, and insightful lyrics... They share a history that is mostly documented in their songs. For instance on "Fine Line" Em explains conditions of their early days in the music industry. Mathers and Hinds have collaborated on numerous songs together such as "Take The World", "Macosa", and "Rush Ya Clique". Hinds came up with the idea for the Shady Corps while writing the song "He Said It"... The 3rd verse of "He Said It" explains it all: 

Throughout the series of musical events that take place you will hear familiar phrases, names, and slang. As well original commentary based on prior songs and characters from Em and Pacewon's catalogs.

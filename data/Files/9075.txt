Title: Gothic (moth)
Aspects: {'N. typica'}

The Gothic (Naenia typica) is a moth of the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It is distributed in temperate Eurasia, in the Palearctic ecozone, including Europe, Turkey, Iran, Caucasus, Armenia, Transcaucasia, Central Asia, Altai mountains, and west and central Siberia.
The forewings are broader than those of most other noctuids, and blackish with a network of fine white lines. The pattern is supposedly reminiscent of some elements of Gothic architecture. The hindwings are grey. The species flies at night in June and July in the British Isles. It sometimes comes to light but is not generally strongly attracted. By contrast, it is strongly attracted to sugar and flowers.

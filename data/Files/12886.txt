Title: Mandelstam variables
Aspects: {'T channel'}

In theoretical physics, the Mandelstam variables are numerical quantities that encode the energy, momentum, and angles of particles in a scattering process in a Lorentz-invariant fashion. They are used for scattering processes of two particles to two particles. The Mandelstam variables were first introduced by physicist Stanley Mandelstam in 1958.

  Where p1 and p2 are the four-momenta of the incoming particles and p3 and p4 are the four-momenta of the outgoing particles, and we are using relativistic units (c=1).
s is also known as the square of the center-of-mass energy (invariant mass) and t is also known as the square of the four-momentum transfer.


== Feynman diagrams ==
The letters 
  
    
      
        s
        ,
        t
        ,
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle s,t,u}
   are also used in the terms s-channel (space-channel), t-channel (time-channel), u-channel. These channels represent different Feynman diagrams or different possible scattering events where the interaction involves the exchange of an intermediate particle whose squared four-momentum equals 
  
    
      
        s
        ,
        t
        ,
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle s,t,u}
  , respectively.

For example, the s-channel corresponds to the particles 1,2 joining into an intermediate particle that eventually splits into 3,4: the s-channel is the only way that resonances and new unstable particles may be discovered provided their lifetimes are long enough that they are directly detectable. The t-channel represents the process in which the particle 1 emits the intermediate particle and becomes the final particle 3, while the particle 2 absorbs the intermediate particle and becomes 4. The u-channel is the t-channel with the role of the particles 3,4 interchanged.

=== Relativistic limit ===
In the relativistic limit, the momentum (speed) is large, so using the relativistic energy-momentum equation, the energy becomes essentially the momentum norm (e.g. 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          p
        
        ⋅
        
          p
        
        +
        
          
            
              m
              
                0
              
            
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E^{2}=\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {p} +{m_{0}}^{2}}
   becomes 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            2
          
        
        ≈
        
          p
        
        ⋅
        
          p
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E^{2}\approx \mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {p} }
   ).  The rest mass can also be neglected.
So for example,

  
    
      
        s
        =
        (
        
          p
          
            1
          
        
        +
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        
          )
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          p
          
            1
          
          
            2
          
        
        +
        
          p
          
            2
          
          
            2
          
        
        +
        2
        
          p
          
            1
          
        
        ⋅
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        ≈
        2
        
          p
          
            1
          
        
        ⋅
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s=(p_{1}+p_{2})^{2}=p_{1}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}+2p_{1}\cdot p_{2}\approx 2p_{1}\cdot p_{2}\,}
  because 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            1
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          m
          
            1
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{1}^{2}=m_{1}^{2}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            2
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          m
          
            2
          
          
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{2}^{2}=m_{2}^{2}.}
  
Thus,

    {\displaystyle s+t+u=m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}+m_{3}^{2}+m_{4}^{2}\,}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          m
          
            i

   is the mass of particle 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  .


==== Proof ====
To prove this, we need to use two facts:

The square of a particle's four momentum is the square of its mass,
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            i
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          m
          
            i
          
          
            2
          
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        (
        1
        )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{i}^{2}=m_{i}^{2}\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad (1)\,}
  And conservation of four-momentum,
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            1
          
        
        +
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          p
          
            3
          
        
        +
        
          p

    {\displaystyle p_{1}+p_{2}=p_{3}+p_{4}\,}
  

  
    
      
        
          p
          
            1
          
        
        =
        −
        
          p

        +
        
          p
          
            3
          
        
        +

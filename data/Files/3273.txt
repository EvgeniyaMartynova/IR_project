Title: Sungai Besi Expressway
Aspects: {'E9'}

The Sungai Besi Expressway  is a controlled-access highway in the Klang Valley region of Peninsular Malaysia. The 28.3-kilometre (17.6-mile) expressway runs between Serdang and Ampang, Selangor through southeastern Kuala Lumpur, parallel and directly adjacent to the North–South Expressway and the Kuala Lumpur–Seremban Expressway.


== Route background ==
The expressway begins at Serdang on the outskirts of Universiti Putra Malaysia, where it continues from the Kajang Dispersal Link Expressway. The expressway then runs northwards immediately east of the North–South Expressway through Seri Kembangan into Sungai Besi. The expressway continues alongside the Kuala Lumpur–Seremban Expressway, running through Bandar Tasik Selatan, Kuchai Lama, Salak South and Cheras. The expressway then diverts northeastwards to Pandan Jaya and Pandan Indah in Ampang, where it terminates.


== History ==
Construction of the original 16.0-kilometre (9.9-mile) expressway from Jalan Istana to Serdang began in 1997, by Road Builder (M) Holdings Bhd (later acquired by IJM Corporation Berhad in 2007). The expressway used to be Selangor state road B13 and the official name was Jalan Kuala Lumpur–Sungai Besi. During construction, the status of the road was changed to a toll expressway and it was redesignated E9. The expressway commenced tolling operation on 15 May 1999.


=== Closure of the Salak Jaya toll plaza (south bound) and extension ===
The toll collection at the Salak Jaya toll plaza (south bound) was abolished on 25 February 2009. To compensate with the closure, the Works Minister, Datuk Seri Mohd. Zin Mohamad announced the extension of the expressway from Jalan Istana to the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 near Pandan Indah, whose concession would be awarded to Besraya. This 12.3-kilometre (7.6-mile) segment was opened to traffic on 15 April 2014.

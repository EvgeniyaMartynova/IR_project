Title: SJ X12
Aspects: {'X12'}

The X12 is a series of two-car electric multiple units operated by Statens J채rnv채gar (SJ) of Sweden as local trains. Eighteen units were built by Asea Brown Boveri in 1991-94, based on the somewhat older X10. From 1997 until 2003 three units were also used by Upplands Lokaltrafik. Two of the units have been converted to the successor X14.

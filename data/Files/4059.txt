Title: Mercedes-Benz F700
Aspects: {'F700'}

The Mercedes-Benz F700 is a concept car produced by Mercedes-Benz in 2007. It was first revealed to the public at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show.
It was given as a gift to UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.


== DiesOtto engine ==
The F700 is powered by Mercedes' DiesOtto engine, so called because it combines elements of diesel and petrol (Otto cycle). The concept 4-cylinder engine displaces 1.8-litres, and features twin sequential turbochargers, generating 177 kW (237 hp) and 400 N⋅m (295 lbf⋅ft) at unspecified engine speeds. As a result, the F700 has performance equivalent to the Mercedes-Benz S350, with a fuel consumption rating of 53 US MPG or 4.43L/100 km.


== PRE-SCAN suspension ==
PRE-SCAN suspension was an upgrade of Active Body Control. Using PRE-SCAN suspension, the car not only reacts highly sensitively to uneven patches of road surface, but also acts in an anticipatory manner. PRE-SCAN uses two laser sensors in the headlamps as “eyes” that produce a precise picture of the road’s condition. From this data, the control unit computes the´parameters for the active suspension settings in order to provide the highest level of comfort.
PRE-SCAN was an early prototype of Magic Body Control (with Road Surface Scan), that was introduced in 2013 on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222). The series version uses visual light twin optical stereo cameras instead of laser.

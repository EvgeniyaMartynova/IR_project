== Geography ==
The district spans across much of Central Virginia including all of Orange, Culpeper, Goochland, Louisa, Nottoway, Amelia, and Powhatan. The district also includes large portions of Chesterfield and Henrico in the suburbs of Richmond. However, Richmond is not currently in the 7th. Spotsylvania also has a large portion in the 7th district just outside of FredericksburgPrior to 1993, the 7th District stretched from the fringes of the Washington, D.C. suburbs to Charlottesville.  It included the far northern portion of the Shenandoah Valley, as well as Manassas and Fredericksburg. The district's current configuration dates from 1993, when Virginia was forced to create a majority-minority district by a Justice Department directive.  At that time, most of Richmond, which had been entirely in the old 3rd District for over a century, was shifted to a newly created 3rd District. The remaining territory in the old 3rd was combined with some more rural areas to the north to form the new 7th District.
From 2013 to 2017, the 7th District stretched from the west end of Richmond through the wealthier portions of Henrico and Chesterfield counties before taking in all of Goochland, Hanover, Louisa, New Kent Orange, Culpeper, Page and Rappahannock counties and a portion of Spotsylvania County.

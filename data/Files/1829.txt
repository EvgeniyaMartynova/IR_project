Title: Hyloxalus exasperatus
Aspects: {'C. exasperatus'}

Hyloxalus exasperatus is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is endemic to Ecuador and found on the eastern slopes of the Andes in Pastaza and Morona-Santiago Provinces. However, it is suggested that specimens from Pastaza represent a different, possibly undescribed species.


== Description ==
Males measure 17.5–20 mm (0.69–0.79 in) and females 21 mm (0.83 in) in snout–vent length (based on only six and two specimens, respectively). Toe webbing is absent but it has a dorsolateral stripe and a short oblique lateral stripe. It is similar to Hyloxalus whymperi but lacks heavy darkening on the abdomen of males. Male call is unknown.


== Habitat and conservation ==
Its natural habitats are pluvial premontane and very humid premontane forests. Its altitudinal range is 970–1,981 m (3,182–6,499 ft) asl. It is threatened by habitat loss and degradation caused by agricultural expansion and logging; introduced species might also be a threat.

Title: Ariane flight VA243
Aspects: {'VA243'}

Ariane flight VA243 is an Ariane 5 space launch of two geostationary satellites that occurred on 25 September 2018 at 22:38:00 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre. It was the 100th launch of Ariane 5 (the 4th in 2018), and the 300th Arianespace mission (the 6th in 2018).


== Payload ==
The launcher was carrying 2 geostationary telecommunications satellites, with a total payload mass of approximately 10,827 kilograms (23,869 lb). The satellites were accommodated inside the long version of the upper stage fairing on the SYLDA adapter.


=== Horizons-3e ===

Horizons-3e, also known as IS-H3e, was built in the United States by Boeing for Horizons Satellite, a joint venture of Intelsat and SKY Perfect JSAT. It had a liftoff mass of about 6,441 kilograms (14,200 lb) and will be operated from the 169° East position.
It is Boeing's 56th, Intelsat's 60th and SKY Perfect JSAT's 20th spacecraft to be launched by Arianespace.


=== Azerspace-2/Intelsat 38 ===

Azerspace-2, also known as Intelsat 38, was built by SSL in the United States for Azercosmos and Intelsat. It had a liftoff mass of about 3,500 kilograms (7,700 lb).Azerbaijan’s 2nd geostationary satellite will be expanding Azerspace-1's capacity while replacing Intelsat 12 from the 45° East position. It is SSL's 65th and Intelsat's 61st spacecraft to be launched by Arianespace.


== Mission description ==


=== Launch date ===
The 6th Arianespace launch of 2018 took place on 25 September 2018 at 22:38:00 UTC (19:38:00 local time) from Ariane Launch Complex No. 3 (ELA 3) in Kourou, French Guiana. It took place after launch VA244 after being postponed due to the unavailability of the GSAT-11 satellite, initially foreseen on board the flight.


=== Orbit ===
The mission was planned to last 42 minutes and 17 seconds, placing the both satellites into geostationary transfer orbits with a perigee altitude of about 250 kilometres (160 mi) and apogee of 35,726 kilometres (22,199 mi) and an inclination of about 6 degrees.

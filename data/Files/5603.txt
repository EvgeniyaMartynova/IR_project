Aspects: {'I Can See Your Voice (disambiguation)'}

I Can See Your Voice Thailand is a television mystery music game show broadcast on Workpoint TV. It is the Thai version of the similarly named South Korean television program, and also the first country to adopt of this franchise.


== Gameplay ==
The guest artist(s) must guess six to seven mystery singers (also called SEE-cret songers) who are good singers (skilled performers) and bad singers (tone-deaf performers) without hearing them singing. They will give their advice to them with a group of panelists under SING-vestigators.
After eliminating one to two SEE-cret songers in each round, they will perform in the Stage of Truth. The last remaining SEE-cret songer(s) standing will be able to duet-perform together with guest artist(s).


== Rounds ==
There are seven individual or group of mystery singers (referred to as SEE-cret songers), standing on a platform with their own aliases to keep them secret and they didn't speak until the initial performance.
Singer's Visual (Season 1—)The guest artist(s) have time to observe and examine each SEE-cret songer based on their appearance. After this, they will play a muted video of each SEE-cret songer that reveals only 0.3 seconds of their singing voice as an additional hint.

Singer's Speech (season 1—)The SEE-cret songers will introduce themselves using their own voice, but it depends if the good singer tells the truth or the bad singer lies on everything.

Singer's Lip-sync (season 1—)Every SEE-cret songer performs a lip-sync of a song. Good singers lip-sync to their own voice, while bad singers lip-sync to other's voices.

Singer's Interview (seasons 1—2, some episodes)The guest artist(s) must have then 60 seconds to make an interview to the remaining SEE-cret songers before making the final decision.

Singer's Dance (season 1—, some episodes)The guest artist(s) must 'predict' three remaining SEE-cret songers based on their dancing performance. It is unrelated to the Stage of Truth, but it depends on their identity.

Title: Ve (Arabic letter)
Aspects: {'Qaf'}

Ve (based on name of the letter ﻑ fāʾ) ڤ‎ is a letter of the Arabic-based Central Kurdish, Comoro, Wakhi, Karakhanid alphabets derived from the Arabic letter fāʾ (ﻑ) with two additional dots. It represents the sound /v/ in the aforementioned uses.
It is sometimes used in Arabic language to write names and loanwords with the phoneme /v/, such as ڤولڤو (Volvo) and ڤيينا viyenna (Vienna), but rather described, for example, in Egyptian Arabic, it is called fe be talat noʾaṭ (فه بتلات نقط, "F with three dots").
It is also frequently used in Israel for transcribing names that have a /v/ sound into Arabic, which is used on Israel's street plates, on signs and labels.
In Jawi script, used for Malay language, ڤ‎ stands for /p/.
The character is mapped in Unicode under position U+06A4.

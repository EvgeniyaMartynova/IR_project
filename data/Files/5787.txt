== Background and composition ==
"Don't Mind" was written by Jones, Marcello Valenzano, Andre Lyon, DJ Khaled, Barry White, Gerald Levert and Edwin Nicholas. The song was produced by Jones, Cool & Dre and Khaled. The song contains resung and replayed elements ("Telling me this..." in the chorus) of White's 1994 song "Practice What You Preach". In an interview with Billboard, Jones said, "I've always been inspired by Motown and soul. I'm a huge Barry White fan, so I had to pay homage. I wasn't like, "This is the one!"—I freestyled the whole thing. It's probably my 400th record. I've got a lot of music."The song was composed and recorded in twelve hours. "I made the beat; the hook was in my head; the day I recorded the whole thing -- I didn’t even write it," Jones said." The song itself was inspired by the multiculturalism of Jones' home city of Miami. As he told the BBC, "It's a melting pot - Spanish, Haitian, French, Asian. And in that melting pot, I stuck with the greetings that were most comfortable to me. You hear a lot of people say 'hola'. Spanish is a language that happens to take a waltz in other people's back yards."

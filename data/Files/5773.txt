Title: I Don't Dance (High School Musical song)
Aspects: {"I Don't Dance"}

"I Don't Dance" is a song performed by actor/singers Lucas Grabeel and Corbin Bleu in the television movie High School Musical 2, released in 2007. It is one of seven songs from the soundtrack High School Musical 2 to reach the Billboard Hot 100. It was also named as the official theme song for the 2007 Little League World Series.


== Scene in High School Musical 2 ==
The song is performed whilst the Wildcats, led by Chad (Corbin Bleu) play baseball against the Lava Springs staff. Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) challenges Chad to perform in the annual Lava Springs talent show, but Chad declines, stating that he doesn't dance. Ryan thinks dancing takes as much game as baseball, and tries to prove it to Chad. The moral of "I Don't Dance" is that even though "you may not think you're good at something, you'll never know for sure until you try."


== Critical reception ==
The Village Voice's Tom Breihan called the song "the movie's best dance-number" and commented how the routine managed to "include rapping and swing-dancing, which sort of blew [his] mind." Reviewer Erin Nolan referred to the song as "insanely catchy." Not all reviews were positive though. The reviewer for the Charlotte Observer called the tune "excruciating," The New York Times felt that the "HSM2 was the shallowest movie he had ever seen" although the music was "a superb idea, as it plays off both the Latinization of the major leagues (by letting a little salsa into the hip-hop) and the spectacular pitcher-batter operetta showdowns of recent seasons," but that the camera work let the scene down noting that "viewers never get a sustained look at the choreography ... and for that reason itâ€™s hard to appreciate specific dancers or their clever configuration."

Title: G30 Schools
Aspects: {'G20 (disambiguation)'}

G30 Schools, formerly known as G20 Schools, is an informal association of secondary schools initiated by David Wylde of St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown, South Africa and Anthony Seldon of Wellington College, Berkshire, United Kingdom in 2006.All the schools claim to have a commitment to excellence and innovation of some sort.  The G30 Schools have an annual conference which aims to bring together a group of school Heads who want to look beyond the parochial  issues of their own schools and national associations and to discuss key issues facing education and their roles as educational leaders.
The association includes 50 schools from 20 countries, with membership by invitation and a vote of existing members.  G30 schools are chosen on two criteria: the reputation of the school and the reputation of the school's leader.

Trachystemon orientalis, commonly known as Abraham-Isaac-Jacob, is a perennial herb of the family Boraginaceae. Native to eastern Europe, it is frequently grown as an ornamental for its early blue-violet flowers and large leaves. It quickly spreads to provide a dense groundcover. Trachystemon is derived from the Greek "trachys," meaning rough, and "stemon," a stamen. The specific epithet, "orientalis" means eastern or from the orient, and is a reference to the native distribution of this species. Trachystemon orientalis is endemic to southeastern Europe and western Asia. http://www.botanicalgarden.ubc.ca/potd/2008/04/trachystemon_orientalis.php

Undrafted in the NHL, Brown signed a two-year, entry level contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 28, 2012. Upon signing with Tampa Bay, Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman said, "I'm anxious to see him play." On March 31, 2012, Brown made his NHL debut in Tampa Bay's 3–2 overtime victory against the Winnipeg Jets. On April 7, he recorded his first career NHL assist in a 4–3 overtime win, also coming against the Winnipeg Jets.

On September 9, 2012, the Tampa Bay Lightning assigned Brown, as well as 17 other players, to the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League (AHL), their top minor league affiliate. This was done in part due to the ongoing 2012–13 NHL lockout that cancelled the first half of the 2012–13 season until late January. On December 28, 2012, Brown sustained a shoulder injury in a 4–2 Crunch victory over the Norfolk Admirals. Prior to the injury, Brown had six goals, 17 points and four penalty minutes in 26 games for Syracuse. It was revealed later in the day that Brown had suffered a broken collarbone, which required surgery to repair. Although expected to compete for a roster spot with the Lightning once NHL play resumed, the injury was expected to sideline him for six-to-eight weeks.On July 7, 2013, Tampa Bay announced that they had re-signed Brown to a one-year, two-way contract. At the end of the season, Brown had skated in 51 games with the Crunch, recording 10 goals and 28 points to go along with 27 penalty minutes. Additionally, he played in 18 Calder Cup playoff games with Syracuse, registering four goals and nine points to go along with 18 penalty minutes.On September 29, 2013, Brown was reassigned to the Crunch by the Lightning as part of roster cuts for the upcoming 2013–14 season. On November 11, 2013, however, Tampa Bay recalled Brown from Syracuse. Prior to being recalled, Brown was on a two-game point streak, with a goal and an assist. It was during this time that he received the nickname "Brownov" as the third player on a successful forward line with fellow Russians Vladislav Namestnikov and Nikita Kucherov.

Brown also played in all four Stanley Cup playoff games in 2014, notching two assists in Tampa Bay's four-game series defeat at the hands of the Montreal Canadiens in the Eastern Conference Quarter-finals.

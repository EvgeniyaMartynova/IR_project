Title: Toyota K engine
Aspects: {'K-series engine'}

The Toyota K series is an inline-four engine that was produced from 1966 through 2007. It is a two-valve pushrod engine design, a rarity for the company. It was originally built from the Toyota Kamigo plant in Toyota City factory in Japan.
All K series are non-crossflow engines – the inlet and exhaust manifolds are on the same side. They have cast iron blocks and aluminium alloy heads, with a crankshaft supported by five main bearings. K series motors have both hydraulic tappet or hydraulic valve lifters, solid lifters and 1.5 ratio rockers with an adjustment thread for tappet clearance. 7k engines were released with only the hydraulic valve lifters from factory, whereas 4k and 5k engines were made with both hydraulic and solid lifters (depending on year and which model vehicle.)


== K ==

The 8-valve OHV 1.1 L (1,077 cc) K was produced from 1966 through 1969. A similar K-B was produced from 1968 through 1969, the -B designates twin carburettors. Thus equipped, the engine produces 73 PS (54 kW; 72 hp) at 6600 rpm. The Publica SL received this more powerful version.
Applications:

Toyota Corolla (KE1x)
Toyota Publica (KP3x)


== 2K ==
The eight-valve OHV 1.0 L (993 cc) 2K was produced from 1969 through 1988. The cylinder bore and stroke was 72 mm × 61 mm (2.83 in × 2.40 in).
Output in 1978 was 35 kW; 48 PS (47 hp) at 5800 rpm, and 66 N⋅m; 48 lbf⋅ft (6.7 kg⋅m) at 3800 rpm. In 1983, New Zealand received a version with 40 kW (54 PS; 54 hp) at 5800 rpm, while Europe received a version with 33 kW (45 PS; 44 hp) at 5600 rpm, both with a maximum torque of 66 N⋅m; 48 lbf⋅ft (6.7 kg⋅m) at 4000 rpm.
Applications:

The 1969 through 1975 3K-B was a twin-carburetor version. The California-spec 3K-C (1977–1979) and 3K-H were other available versions.

In 1980, the 4K produced 43 kW; 59 PS (58 hp) at 5250 rpm. From 1983 through 1984, output was 46 kW; 63 PS (62 hp) at 5600 rpm and 97 N⋅m; 72 lbf⋅ft (9.9 kg⋅m) at 3600 rpm.
The 1981 and 1982 California-spec 4K-C produced 43 kW; 59 PS (58 hp) at 5200 rpm and 90 N⋅m; 67 lbf⋅ft (9.2 kg⋅m) at 3600 rpm. Torque was up to 100 N⋅m; 74 lbf⋅ft (10.2 kg⋅m) at 3400 rpm for the fuel injected 1982 through 1984 4K-E. The Japan-spec 4K-U produced 55 kW; 75 PS (74 hp) at 5600 rpm and 105 N⋅m; 77 lbf⋅ft (10.7 kg⋅m) at 3600 rpm in 1982. Available in hydraulic and solid lifter configurations
Applications:

Toyota Kijang/second generation Toyota Tamaraw
Toyota Liteace
Toyota Starlet
Daihatsu Charmant
1977–1979 Daihatsu Delta 750 (KD11)


== 5K ==

The 1.5 L (1,486 cc) 5K was produced from 1983 through 1996. Typical output is 53 kW (71 hp; 72 PS) at 5600 rpm. Bore and stroke is 80.5 mm × 73 mm (3.17 in × 2.87 in). It was available with either 4- or 5-speed manual transmissions. Like the smaller 4K model, it uses hydraulic lifters as well as solid lifters for the pushrod.Applications:

1983.08-1987.10 Toyota Carina Van (KA67V 'Van') 5K-J
1983.05-1987.08 Toyota Corolla Van (KE74V) 5K-J
1983.10-1987.12 Toyota Corona Van (KT147V 'Van') 5K-J, 61 kW (82 hp; 83 PS) at 5,200 rpm
Toyota Liteace KR27 Van
Toyota Liteace KM36 Van 49 kW (66 hp; 67 PS) at 4800 rpm, 115 N⋅m; 85 lbf⋅ft (11.7 kg⋅m) at 3200 rpm
Toyota Kijang/Tamaraw
Toyota TownAce KR41 Van
Toyota Forklift (late 1980s-early 1990s model)


== 7K ==

The 1.8 L (1,781 cc) 7K was first introduced in 1983. Cylinder bore and stroke was 80.5 mm × 87.5 mm (3.17 in × 3.44 in). Output was 60 kW; 81 PS (80 hp) at 4600 rpm and 139 N⋅m; 103 lbf⋅ft (14.2 kg⋅m) at 2800 rpm while the EFI version which can be found in Toyota Kijang KF80 produces 62 kW; 84 PS (83 hp) at 4600 rpm and 147 N⋅m; 108 lbf⋅ft (15 kg⋅m) at 3200 rpm.
The Engine was available with a 5 speed manual & 4 speed automatic transmission. Available in both fuel injected and carburetted configurations, the 7K produces much more power and torque compared to the other K engines however it is a lot less 'rev happy' due to having such a large stroke.
7K-E is available in KR42 Townace SBV vans (1997–2007) using a large G52 5 speed gearbox (same bellhousing to box pattern as W55), or automatic.
Applications:

Toyota Kijang/Toyota Tamaraw FX/Toyota Revo/Toyota TownAce/Toyota LiteAce

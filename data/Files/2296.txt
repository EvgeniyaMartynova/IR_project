Title: Dillwynia floribunda
Aspects: {'D. floribunda'}

Dillwynia floribunda  is a common bushy shrub found north of Ulladulla in moist areas of eastern Australia. It grows from 1 to 2 metres tall, the habitat is wet heathland, often on poor sandy soils. The specific epithet floribunda is from Latin, and it refers to the abundance of yellow and red flowers. This attractive species has a common name of the Parrot Pea. Though casually remarked by bushwalkers as one of the egg & bacon group of wildflowers.
Flowers are in pairs, but they give the impression of being in a terminal inflorescence, being so closely packed together. Leaves are usually twisted, but may be straight in some individuals. Leaves flattened, or triangular in cross section; 5 to 15 mm long, rough and somewhat bumpy.  The original specimen was collected in Sydney, and first published in 1805 by the eminent English botanist, James Edward Smith.

Title: Stypandra glauca
Aspects: {'S. glauca'}

Stypandra glauca is a species of rhizomatous perennials. The plant is widespread across southern areas of Australia, where it is informally known as the nodding blue lily or blind grass.
The lily-like flowers are blue with yellow stamens, that appear during winter or spring. The plant is commonly grown in gardens and frequently encountered in its native habitat. The leaves are bluish, as described in the epithet glauca (Gk.), these clasp the stem in an alternate arrangement and are up to 200 millimetres long.
It was first described by Robert Brown in 1810 in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae.
Ingestion of flowering plants has been found to cause blindness in goats.

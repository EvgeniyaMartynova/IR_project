XGI Technology Inc. (Chinese: 圖誠科技; pinyin: Tú Chéng Kējì) is based upon the old graphics division of SiS spun off as a separate company, and the graphics assets of Trident Microsystems.


== History ==
Founded in June 2003 and headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, in December 2003, XGI announced the Volari Duo, a graphics card with two GPUs. This was seen as part of a potentially successful attempt to become competitive with ATI Technologies and Nvidia Corporation, which were the two largest GPU manufacturers in the world at the time.
A few months after the announced release, XGI graphics cards were found by enthusiasts and hardware reviewers to be less than competitive with ATi and Nvidia cards. Some of the many performance and visualization problems were blamed on underdeveloped drivers. Even so, XGI cards received good reviews in the low price/low performance video card market: XGI Volari V3 cards were judged by some reviewers to be competitive and even superior to equally priced video cards that were on the market, such as a Nvidia GeForce MX 4000 card. Many reviewers though were pessimistic of the possibility that XGI would be competitive in the 3D graphic card market.
On 6 March 2006, ATI Technologies announced the acquisition of Shanghai-based MacroSynergy, a fabless chip designer and XGI Technology alliance company, as well as related personnel working out of XGI Technology's Santa Clara, California location.
On 2006-10-17, RealVision Inc. announced forming technology alliance with XGI Technology Inc. On 2006-10-23, RealVision Inc. announced VREngine/XMD-Advanced series video cards, which used the previously canceled Volari 8300 (named Volari XG47), for use in medical imaging. Mass production was set to begin on 2007Q1.
On 2010-05-27, SiS (Silicon Integrated Systems) took control of XGI Technology and inherits its iTV technology with an unveiling soon after. So far there is no product page/support page for any XGI products on www.sis.com.
On 2010-10-01, Its official SiS state full buy out of XGI; XGI Technology was then declared on its end of line (EOL).

HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen is a frigate of the Royal Norwegian Navy.  Launched on 5 April 2006, she is the lead ship of the Fridtjof Nansen class of warships.


== Counter-piracy ==
On 26 February 2009, the Norwegian government decided to deploy HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen to the Gulf of Aden, thereby participating in the ongoing Operation Atalanta, the European Union's counter-piracy campaign in Somalia. Fridtjof Nansen joined the campaign in August 2009.Fridtjof Nansen's engagement in Operation Atalanta was carried out without a permanently stationed helicopter. Mainly due to delays in delivery of the new NH-90, the ship is equipped with two ultra-fast RHIBs as a replacement.
In November 2009 she became involved in a fire-fight with suspected pirates after being attacked while inspecting a fishing vessel.


== RIMPAC 2014 ==
In 2014, Fridtjof Nansen took part in the naval exercise RIMPAC 2014 in the Pacific Ocean. During the exercise, she used a Naval Strike Missile to sink the  USS Ogden (LPD-5), a decommissioned U.S. Navy amphibious transport dock, as a target 55 nautical miles northwest of Hawaii on 10 July 2014.

Title: TV Eye Live 1977
Aspects: {'T.V. Eye'}

TV Eye Live 1977 (or TV Eye) is a live album by Iggy Pop originally released in 1978. Iggy took a $90 000 advance from RCA Records to finish his contract with a live album. According to allmusic.com, the album was assembled from soundboard tapes. Iggy Pop doctored them in a German studio, quickly and cheaply for around $5,000. The album features recordings from concerts on March 21 & 22, 1977 at The Agora in Cleveland, Ohio; on March 28, 1977 at The Aragon in Chicago, Illinois; and on October 26, 1977 at The Uptown Theater in Kansas City, Missouri.
The album is notable for the presence of David Bowie on keyboards and background vocals for selected tracks and the rather crushing bass and drum sound; also, with the Sales brothers, the lineup prefigures in part Bowie's Tin Machine lineup.

Title: Farman F.430
Aspects: {'F430'}

The Farman F.430 was a 1930s French light transport designed and built by the Farman Aviation Works. Two variants with different engines were known as the F.431 and F.432.


== Design and development ==
The F.430 was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a tail-wheel landing gear. It was powered by two wing-mounted de Havilland Gipsy Major piston engines. The enclosed cockpit and cabin had room for a pilot and five passengers. The prototype F-ANBY appeared in 1934 and the F.431 variant with 180 hp (130 kW) Renault Bengali-Six inverted piston engines was exhibited at the 1934 Paris Salon de l'Aeronautique. A further variant with 180 hp (130 kW) Farman radial engines was designated the F.432.
After the company had been nationalised and became part of SNCAC a variant with a retractable landing gear (designated the  Centre 433) was completed, and flown for the first time in December 1938. The F.430 and two F.431s were used by Air Service between Paris and Biarritz.

Title: WSPR (AM)
Aspects: {'WACM'}

WSPR (1490 AM) is a radio station licensed to serve West Springfield, Massachusetts.  The station is owned by John Fuller, through licensee Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation. It airs a Spanish tropical format. During the late 1960s and early 1970s the station aired a Top 40 format under the callsign WTXL.  Although it was programmed very well, it never achieved rating success due to the heavy competition from crosstown WHYN/560.
In 1974, WTXL transitioned to a progressive album-rock format.  A year later, the station was sold to a group headed by Boston radio host Jerry Williams.  WTXL then went off the air for two months before returning under the new ownership as WNUS, running NBC's News and Information Service.
The station was assigned the WACM call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on September 15, 1983.On July 3, 2015, WACM changed their format from Spanish to oldies with WXCT. On November 22, 2015, WACM rebranded as "Kool Radio Good Times... Great Oldies".
On April 1, 2016, WACM changed their format to Spanish tropical, simulcasting WSPR 1270 AM Springfield. On April 13, 2016, WACM changed their call letters to WSPR, swapping calls with 1270 AM.
On May 1, 2016 WSPR split from its simulcast with WACM 1270 AM (which flipped to oldies) and rebranded as "Bomba 1490".

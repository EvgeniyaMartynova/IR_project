Dunhill was the title sponsor for the competition until the agreement was ended at the end of 2004 season as tobacco advertising was banned in the country. From 2005 to 2010, the Piala FA incorporated the TM brand as part of its logo as the title sponsor. After the end of TM sponsorship for seven consecutive years, FAM has been partnering with Astro Media as strategic partner for Malaysian League starting in 2011 season. In 2012, FAM introduced a new logo which has been used from 2012 until the end of 2015 season. For 2016 season a new logo was introduced as part of the takeover of the league by FMLLP. Superbest Power has become the title sponsor for the tournament for 2016 season. For 2017 season, FMLLP has introduced a new logo without the title sponsor. FMLLP introduced a new logo with Shopee as the title sponsor from the 2018 season onwards.

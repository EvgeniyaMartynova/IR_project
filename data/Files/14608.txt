Title: VFA-115
Aspects: {'VA115'}

Strike Fighter Squadron 115 (VFA-115) is known as the "Eagles", callsign "Talon", a United States Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet strike fighter squadron stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni. Their tail code is NF. It was established as Torpedo Squadron VT-11 on 10 October 1942, redesignated VA-12A on 15 November 1946, VA-115 on 15 July 1948, then finally VFA-115.


== Squadron insignia and nickname ==

The squadron’s first insignia was designed by Walt Disney and consisted of a black torpedo with the skull & crossbones on it and a winged cherub wearing a green helmet nicknamed "Little Butch."  A new squadron insignia was approved on 17 September 1956 and is still in use. The squadron was known as the "Arabs" from the 1950s to 1979, at which time they were renamed the "Eagles".  During the squadron’s deployment to the Indian Ocean in 1989, they temporarily changed their nickname back to Arabs to enhance the morale while operating in the Arabian Sea.


== History ==


=== 1940s ===
Torpedo Squadron Eleven (VT-11) was established at Naval Air Station San Diego on 10 October 1942, flying TBF Avengers. Over the next five years, the squadron upgraded through several models of TBF and TBM Avengers.

On 25 April 1943, VT-11 arrived at Guadalcanal. The squadron's first combat was flown from Henderson Field as part of Carrier Air Group Eleven (CVG-11). The squadron was land-based at Guadalcanal, and in June 1943, VT-11 pilots conducted the first daylight raids on Bougainville and the Solomon Islands. They flew patrol, search, spotting, strike, and night mine-laying missions.
From 29 September 1944 to 1 February 1945, VT-11 was deployed aboard USS Hornet. The squadron participated in the first strikes against Okinawa and two weeks later converged on Leyte Gulf to protect the landing and supply ships engaged in the Battle of Leyte. On 25 October, the Japanese Fleet converged on Leyte to oppose the landings. Squadron TBMs were launched from 550 km (342 mi) away (well beyond normal range) to strike the fleet. The TBMs struck the retiring Japanese ships, scoring hits on a battleship and two cruisers. All the squadron's aircraft returned, completing a 1,000 km (621 mi) round trip. Seven Navy Crosses were awarded to VT-11 aircrews during this campaign.
In November and December 1944, the squadron continued to provide support for the occupation of Leyte, striking targets on Luzon in support of the landings on Mindoro. In January 1945, the squadron struck ships and targets on Formosa and Luzon in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon. The squadron participated in operations in the South China Sea (the first time an American Task Force had entered these waters since the beginning of the war), striking targets at Cam Ranh Bay and a convoy off Qui Nhơn, French Indo-China, shipping at the Pescadores Island, and Hong Kong.

An exhibit honoring VT-11 during World War II is on board the USS Hornet Museum in Alameda, California.
After the war, Naval Air Station San Diego became VT-11's new homeport, and the squadron was redesignated as Attack Squadron 12A (VA-12A) in November 1946. VA-12A, along with Carrier Air Group (CVAG-11), underwent extensive training and embarked on USS Valley Forge, the U.S. Navy's newest aircraft carrier. In June 1948, VA-12A deployed on a world cruise, a first for a U.S. Navy air group and milestone for the squadron. A symbolic globe later became part of the squadron's official insignia to commemorate the cruise.
On 15 July 1948, VA-12A was re-designated Attack Squadron 115 (VA-115), and in December, the squadron transitioned to the AD Skyraider, operating several improved models over the next ten years.

In September 1966, VA-115 joined Carrier Air Wing Five aboard USS Hancock and made its second deployment to Vietnam from January to July 1967.
From August 1967 to January 1970, the squadron was put in an inactive, stand-down status. This was a transitional period as the squadron awaited the arrival of the A-6 Intruder, and there were no aircraft and only a few administrative personnel assigned. This is the only known instance in which a squadron was not disestablished but remained on the active squadron inventory in an inactive status.


=== 1970s ===
In January 1970, the squadron resumed active status and was reassigned to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington for transition to the A-6 Intruder. The squadron received their first KA-6D tanker aircraft in February 1971. In 1970 VA-115 was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 16 (CVW-16) (tail code "AH") for deployment on the modernized USS Midway. However, the modernization of Midway took longer than expected, CVW-16 was disestablished in 1971 and all its squadrons were assigned to Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) (tail code "NF").

The squadron dropped 22 JDAM on 14 targets in Iraq, before taking part in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Before hostilities ceased on 9 April 2003, the squadron dropped 170 t (370,000 lb) of ordnance and passed 1.2 mio l (3.5 million lb) of fuel in the tanker support role. This wartime performance earned the squadron and the Abraham Lincoln Battle Group the Navy Unit Commendation (the sixth awarded to VFA-115).
In May 2004, the squadron deployed aboard USS John C. Stennis. In support of the "Fleet Response Plan", the squadron participated in various joint exercises including "Northern Edge", "Rim of the Pacific", "Joint Air and Sea Exercise" and a MiG-29 passage exercise. Additionally, VFA-115 authored a comprehensive joint doctrine for maritime interdiction. This document was adopted by Commander Pacific Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations as the model for joint employment, and is today the primary training focus for deploying U.S. West Coast strike groups. The squadron was awarded the Commander Naval Air Pacific Battle Efficiency Award for 2004.
In January 2006, the squadron deployed aboard USS Ronald Reagan to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

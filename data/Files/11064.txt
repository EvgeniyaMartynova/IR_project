Title: An-Nahl
Aspects: {'Q16'}

An-Naḥl (Arabic: الْنَّحْل, "The Bees") is the 16th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur'an, with 128 (āyāt). It is named after honey bees, and contains a comparison of the industry and adaptability of honey bees to the industry of man. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbāb al-nuzūl), it is an earlier "Meccan surah", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.


== Summary ==
This sura warns against polytheism, saying that the pagan gods cannot create anything ([Quran 16:20]), and against comparisons between Allah and any created beings ([Quran 16:74]). It praises Allah for giving the Earth with all its wealth to mankind. According to this sura, all wonders of the natural world, like seas, stars, mountains are proofs of God's infinite power ([Quran 16:14]). The verse 66 talks about the miracle in milk formation in cattle: "From what is within their bodies, between excretions and blood, We produce for your drink, milk, pure and agreeable to those who drink it." The verse 67 talks about miracle of vine: "And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine, ye get out strong drink and wholesome food: behold, in this also is a sign for those who are wise".
The verse [Quran 16:103] addresses the allegations that Muhammad has invented the Quran.

== Building project ==
Starting in the fall of 2008, O'Gorman tore down O-Wing and G-Wing and built a new building to replace them. The building has three multilevel wings (O-Wing, G-Wing, and K-Wing) to replace the old single-story wings. There is a new multilevel 1,000-seat Performing Arts Center. Construction was completed in the Fall of 2011.
The old building was constructed in the late 1950s and early 1960s and opened its doors to students in the fall of 1961. Prior to that, the Catholic high school in Sioux Falls was Cathedral High School, but that school did not have enough room to accommodate all of the Catholic high school students in the city, which is why Bishop Lambert Hoch decided to build O'Gorman High School. 
The football field McEneaney Field received a $2.5 million facelift. The removal of the 6 lane track and the installation of a new 8 lane track was the first step. The old scoreboard was replaced with a brand new Daktronics scoreboard with video replay. The grass was replaced with field turf. Steps completed prior to the 2009 football season include the building of a bathroom/ concession stand across the track behind the west end zone and the installation of more bleachers on the home and visiting sides of the field.

Aspects: {'M. Saravanan'}

Datuk Seri Saravanan s/o Murugan (Tamil: மு. சரவணன், romanized: Mu. Caravaṇaṉ; born 4 February 1968) commonly referred to as M. Saravanan, is the member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the Tapah constituency in Perak. He is a member of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) and was the former Deputy Minister of Youth and Sports in the Barisan Nasional coalition government of Najib Tun Razak.Before being elected to the Dewan Rakyat (the lower house of Malaysia's Parliament), Saravanan was a Senator. In the 2008 general election, he contested the seat of Tapah and won, defeating a People's Justice Party (PKR) candidate. The MIC suffered widespread losses at the election, leaving Saravanan as one of only three MIC members in the Dewan Rakyat. Despite his party's reduced presence in Parliament and the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, Saravanan was appointed as a Deputy Minister.Within the MIC, Saravanan is seen as an ally of its President Samy Vellu, being elected as a vice-president of the MIC on Vellu's ticket and defending Vellu from opposition attacks. However he lost in the party re-election close fight for the position of Deputy President in 2015 to another MIC Vice-President, S. K. Devamany.

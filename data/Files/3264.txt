Title: ICD-10 Chapter IV: Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases
Aspects: {'E7'}

ICD-10 is an international statistical classification used in health care and related industries.
Produced by the World Health Organization, it is used in several countries around the world. Some have gone on to develop their own national enhancements, building off the international classification.
Chapter IV of ICD-10 deals with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases.

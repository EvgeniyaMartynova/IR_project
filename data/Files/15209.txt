== History ==
The airfield was one of three constructed by the Japanese during their occupation of the island in 1943/1944.  The US Army 158th Regimental Combat Team landed on the beach and encountered stiff resistance. The 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment parachuted on Kamiri Airifled on 3 July 1944. The Japanese garrison was largely defeated after a suicidal counter-attack by the Japanese on 5 July. The island was finally secured after a month of hard fighting on 31 August 1944.
The three airfields on Nomefoor (Yebrurro, Kamiri and Namber)  were used by the American forces after liberating the island. All three were first repaired and upgraded by the Seabees of the 95th U.S. Naval Construction Battalion.  Kamari (00°56′49.77″S 134°49′29.23″E) is located along the northwest shoreline of the island and was used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) until July 1945 when it was abandoned.  It has been disused since the end of the war.
Namber (01°04′21.72″S 134°49′51.57″E) is located along the southwest shoreline and was improved and used by American forces, then also abandoned after the end of the war.
Yebrurro Airfield, also used by the Americans, remained in service until the end of the war. It is still in use today as Kornasoren Airport.

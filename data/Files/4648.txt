Title: Logitech G27
Aspects: {'G27'}

The Logitech G27 is an electronic steering wheel designed for Sim racing video games on the PC, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2. It uses a USB interface, and is based upon the previous G25, with some new features including the use of helical gearing instead of the previous straight gears used on the G25. As of December 2015, the Logitech G27 is no longer sold by Logitech, in favor of the newer G29 and G920 steering wheels now offered by Logitech. 


== Specifications ==
It features:

A wheel:
270 mm, leather-wrapped steering wheel.
Range of rotation adjustable up to 900 degrees.
2 force feedback motors.
One set of gears between motors and wheel, including an anti-backlash design.
2 paddleshifters.
6 buttons.
Dual-motor force feedback with helical gears that produces less noise than the G25, and provides better steering response.
A set of stainless steel pedals, including:
Accelerator. (light spring)
Brake (heavy spring)
Clutch. (medium spring)
A carpet grip which keeps the pedals in position while playing.
A shifter unit:
8 buttons.
1 D-pad.
A gear stick with a six-speed 'H' pattern gearbox. Reverse is selected by pressing down and changing to sixth.
Unlike the superseded Logitech G25, the shifter unit does not include a selector to switch to sequential up-down mode, only allowing six-speed mode to be used. The shift click has improved though and gives less noise.

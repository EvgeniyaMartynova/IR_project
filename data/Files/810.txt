Title: Brephulopsis cylindrica
Aspects: {'B. cylindrica'}

Brephulopsis cylindrica is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Enidae.
The specific name cylindricus cannot be used for this species because Bulimus cylindricus Menke, 1828 is a junior homonym of Bulimus cylindricus Gray, 1825. The correct name is most probably Brephulopsis fusiformis (Menke, 1828).

"I DON’T CARE" (1905) Words by Jean Lenox


== Lyrics ==
VERSE:
They say I’m crazy, got no sense, 
But I don’t care,
They may or may not mean offense, 
But I don’t care,
You see I’m sort of independent,
Of a clever race descendent,
My star is on the ascendant, 
That’s why I don’t care.
CHORUS:  
I don’t care, I don’t care,
What they may think of me,
I’m happy go lucky,
Men say I am plucky,
So jolly and care free,
I don’t care, I don’t care,
If I do get the mean and stony stare,
If I’m never successful, 
It won’t be distressful,
‘Cos I don’t care.
VERSE:
Some people say I think I’m it,
But I don’t care,
They say they don’t like me a bit,
But I don’t care,
You see I’m sort of independent,
Of a clever race descendant,
My star is on the ascendant,
That’s why I don’t care.
CHORUS:
I don’t care, I don’t care,
If people don’t like me,
I’ll try to outlive it,
I know I’ll forgive it,
And live contentedly,
I don’t care, I don’t care,
If people do not try to treat me fair,
There is naught can amaze me,
Dislike can not daze me, 
‘Cos I don’t care.

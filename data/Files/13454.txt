== Premise ==
The show is centered on best friends Thomas and Michael and their far from typical high school lives at Northwood High School. The unlikely friends have polar-opposite personalities, with Thomas constantly coming up with nefarious schemes and hatching a new diabolical plan daily, while Michael focuses on his varsity sports of soccer, swimming and track. The duo is complimented by mutual friend Sarah Davis, who helps to bring balance and sensibility to the misadventures often resulting from Thomas' poorly planned schemes.  The show begins during Thomas and Michael's Junior year of high school.


== Characters ==


=== Main characters ===
Thomas (Tarrin Lewis) – One of the two protagonists of the series, Thomas is the schemer of the duo. He often develops plots and schemes aimed to get around working hard for something, and most often, fails miserably. He is extremely tenacious and his enthusiasm often infects those around him, particularly Michael and Josh, who would otherwise have better judgment.
Michael (Benjamin Haines) – One of the two protagonists of the series, Michael is usually Thomas' "sidekick". He is an all-around-athlete, competing as a varsity member of the school soccer, swimming and track teams. He is always seen carrying around his trademark blue water bottle.
Sarah Davis (Rachel Porter) – Thomas and Michael's close friend, Sarah is independent and academically ambitious. She has a Type A personality and is always doing something productive with her time. She is a bookworm and accomplished violinist.  Too smart to become involved in Thomas' schemes, she often hangs around the duo because she has a crush on Michael, which she disguises by flaunting her intellectual superiority above both boys. Despite her cold exterior, Sarah cares deeply for both Thomas and Michael and works hard to help them both when they get into trouble.


=== Secondary characters ===
 Josh Chén (Andrew Jin) The Loyal and devoted friend to Thomas, Michael and Sarah. He is a science nerd, and is often seen around the school wearing a lab coat and goggles. Although Thomas is embarrassed to be seen around him, Josh's help is often enlisted whenever Thomas' need more technical help with one of his schemes. Josh seeks out Thomas and Michael as friends after he is kicked out of the science club following an accident/explosion.

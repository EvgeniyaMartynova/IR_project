Title: Volkswagen Touareg
Aspects: {'R50'}

The Volkswagen Touareg (German pronunciation: [ˈtuːaʁɛk]) is a mid-size luxury SUV produced by German automaker Volkswagen since 2002 at the Volkswagen Bratislava Plant. The vehicle was named after the nomadic Tuareg people, inhabitants of the Saharan interior in North Africa.


== Development ==
The Touareg (internally designated Typ 7L) was a joint venture project developed by Volkswagen Group, Audi and Porsche. The goal was to create an off-road vehicle that could handle like a sports car. The team, with over 300 people, was led by Klaus-Gerhard Wolpert and based in Weissach, Germany. The result of the joint project is the Volkswagen Group PL71 platform, shared by the Touareg, the Audi Q7 and the Porsche Cayenne, although there are styling, equipment, and technical differences between those vehicles. The Touareg and Porsche both seat five, while the Q7's stretched wheelbase accommodates a third row for seven passengers. The Volkswagen Touareg is built at the Volkswagen Bratislava Plant in Bratislava, Slovakia, alongside the Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne.
Due to the demand, and the exchange rates of euros against the US dollar, as well as different pricing and environmental policies in the US, the V6 and V8 engine variants make up most of Volkswagen's American Touareg offering. Compared to other Volkswagen-branded vehicles sold in the US which are aimed at the mass market, Touaregs came in the more upscale trims and placed in competition with other luxury crossover SUVs from BMW and Mercedes-Benz.[1][2] However, a limited number of the V10 TDI Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engines was available in the 2004 model year (before being pulled for environmental reasons). They were brought back to the United States for the 2006 model year as a "Tier I emissions concept (43 state emissions)".[3]


== First generation (2002–2010) ==

The Touareg comes as standard with a four-wheel drive system. It has an automatic progressively locking centre differential (with manual override), and a "low range" setting that can be activated with in-cabin controls. Options to make the vehicles more capable off-road include an available 4-wheel Adaptive Air Suspension (plus Continuous Damping Control) which can raise the car's ride height on command, and an interior switch allowing the rear differential to be manually locked. A very rare but available option was also a front locking differential. Its load level ground clearance is at 6.3 in (160 mm), Off Road Level is at 9.6 in (244 mm), and Xtra clearance of 11.8 in (300 mm).

A 2007 Volkswagen Touareg 2 V10 TDI towed a Boeing 747 airliner in 2006.


=== Engines ===


==== W12 (2005–2010) ====
The 6.0-litre double overhead camshaft (DOHC), 48-valve W12 engined version was initially intended to be a limited-edition model, with just 500 units planned to be produced; around 330 were slated for sale in Saudi Arabia, with the remainder sold in Europe. Some of those W12 Touaregs were sold in China, but the number of sold is unknown. No sales in the United States were made. Eventually, the W12 model became an ordinary model without any production restrictions. It is estimated to reach 100 kilometres per hour (62.1 mph) in 5.9 seconds.


==== V10 TDI (2002–2010) ====
The V10 TDI was offered in the United States for a limited time in 2004, but emissions regulations forced it off the market for a temporary period.The V10 TDI returned to the U.S. market as 2006 model year vehicle in five states. Later US models went on sale in 2006, which was compliant with 50 states emission with Ultra-low sulfur diesel and particulate filter.  Stricter California Air Resources Board (CARB) emissions standards resulted in the V10 TDI being cancelled again in the United States. The V10 engine has since been replaced by a V6 TDI engine that meets the CARB minimum emission requirements for the 2009 model year. However, in 2015 it was discovered that these V6 engines were not meeting the CARB emissions requirements and were part of the Volkswagen emissions scandal.
Fifth Gear used this version for testing to tow a Boeing 747.


=== Facelift (2006-2010) ===

The Touareg's first facelift was unveiled at the 2006 Paris Motor Show, with its North American debut at the 2007 New York Auto Show as a 2008 model. It now features the shield grille from others in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars range. The updated Touareg has more than 2300 redesigned parts and boasts some new technological features:

ABS Plus, which works in conjunction with the traction control system, and shortens the braking distance by up to 25% on loose surfaces;
Front Scan, an adaptive cruise control system, which can slow or even stop the car depending on traffic conditions;
Side Scan, a blind-spot monitor : it uses radar at the rear of the car to sense another car's presence, and causes light-emitting diodes (LEDs) built into the wing mirrors to flash. If the driver indicates to move out, the LEDs flash at an accelerated rate to warn the driver until the other vehicle moves out of the Touareg's field of vision.The 2007 Touareg, alongside an already lengthy options list, could be equipped with a driving dynamics package, a rollover sensor, a 620 watt Dynaudio sound system, and redesigned comfort seats. All diesel versions now have the diesel particulate filter standard.In the US and Canada, the facelifted Touareg was marketed as the Touareg 2 for the 2008–2010 model year, reverting to simply Touareg in 2011.


==== R50 (2007–2010) ====

The Touareg R50 is the third Volkswagen after the Golf and Passat to be given the 'R' treatment by Volkswagen Individual GmbH. The R50 global launch was at the 2007 Australian International Motor Show.
The "R50" naming comes from the engine displacement: 5.0 L. The R50 was offered with a 5.0-litre V10 diesel engine that produces 257 kW (349 PS; 345 bhp) and 850 N⋅m (627 lbf⋅ft) of torque, pushing the car from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 6.7 seconds.The R50 came standard with 21-inch Omanyt wheels, sport-tuned air suspension, decorative 'engine spin' finish interior trim inlays, and an optional four-zone Climatronic climate control system.

==== V6 TDI Clean Diesel (2009–2015) ====
The V6 TDI Clean Diesel is a version of the V6 TDI with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system, replacing the V10 TDI in US and Canada. The Touareg contains a 4.5 US gallons (17 l; 3.7 imp gal) tank in the rear of the vehicle underneath the spare tyre which stores the AdBlue solution. It is estimated that this tank will need to be replenished every 6,000–10,000 miles (9,700–16,100 km). The Touareg does not include NOX storage catalyst found in Jetta Clean Diesel TDI due to its heavy weight.Touareg BlueTDI was unveiled at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show. The production version of the V6 TDI Clean Diesel was unveiled at the 2008 LA Auto Show.Although sales of the production version were planned in North America for 2008, it did not start until 2009.

The beam pattern changes its direction continually so that vehicles in front are not being illuminated, while the area surrounding them is being constantly illuminated at high beam intensity.

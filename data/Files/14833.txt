== Full-Contact ==
Full-Contact is a form of kickboxing where both punches and kicks are thrown with full force with strikes below the waist prohibited.  Most matches are settled by either a point's decision or referee stoppage and like most other amateur contact sports, head and body protection is compulsory.  More detail on Full-Contact rules can be found on the W.A.K.O. website.  At Belgrade both men and women took part in the style with the men having twelve divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, and the women had seven ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs.

By the end of the championship Russia was by far the most successful country in the category winning seven golds and six bronzes in both male and female competition.

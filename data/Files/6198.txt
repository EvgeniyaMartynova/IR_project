Title: I Love This Life (EP)
Aspects: {'I Love This Life'}

I Love This Life is an EP by American country music duo LoCash. It is their first release for Reviver Music, and its title track is the duo's first Top 10 hit on Country Airplay.


== History ==
The duo, formerly known as LoCash Cowboys, signed to Reviver Music in 2015 and released "I Love This Life". They announced the EP's release to digital outlets in October 2015. Chris Lucas, one-half of the duo, said, "It’s a new and established sound for us. Something fresh, with the LoCash flavor and the roots of country music". On October 19, the duo previewed the EP at a listening party at the Roy Orbison Building in Nashville, Tennessee. The EP consists of six tracks, five of which were co-written by at least one half of the duo.


== Critical reception ==
Giving it a "B+", Tammy Ragusa of Nash Country Weekly wrote that "There's a great energy to I Love This Life that makes the title track the perfect introduction to the rest of the album." She praised the production and lyrics of "Shipwrecked" and "Till the Wheels Fall Off", but criticized the production of other tracks, saying that "when the songs are this well-written, it's easy to overlook a little studio sleight of hand".

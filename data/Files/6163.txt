Aspects: {'I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg'}

I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg (German: Ich hab' mein Herz in Heidelberg verloren) is a 1952 West German romantic musical film directed by Ernst Neubach and starring Eva Probst, Adrian Hoven and Paul Hörbiger. The film takes its title from the popular song I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg, whose lyrics Neubach had co-written in the 1920s. It was part of a strong trend towards heimatfilm productions set in romanticised  Southern Germany, Austria or Switzeland. It premiered in Heidelberg on 29 October 1952.
Although they share the same title, the film is not a remake of I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg from 1926. It was made at the Spandau Studios in Berlin with location shooting at a variety of places included Cuxhaven, Wiesbaden and Heidelberg itself.

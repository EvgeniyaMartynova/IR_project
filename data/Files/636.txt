Title: NIFL Premier Intermediate League
Aspects: {'B Division'}

The NIFL Premier Intermediate League is the third division of the Northern Ireland Football League, the national association football league in Northern Ireland, and the highest intermediate division in Northern Ireland, occupying level three in the Northern Ireland football league system â€“ below the NIFL Premiership (level 1) and NIFL Championship (level 2).


== 2016 restructuring ==
Under reforms agreed by the NIFL clubs in 2014, from 2016, when the previous Championship 1 acquired senior status, Championship 2 continued as the Premier Intermediate League, retaining its intermediate status and thus became the top intermediate league in Northern Ireland.


== Current Members ==
The Premier Intermediate League consists of 12 teams; however, on 15 August 2019, Lurgan Celtic announced that its senior side would withdraw from the NIFL, meaning that the league would function with 11 teams for the duration of the 2019-20 season.

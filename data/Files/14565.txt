In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the squadron participated in Operation Enduring Freedom flying missions against the Al Qaida infrastructure and Taliban forces in Afghanistan as well as protecting assets in Diego Garcia. When Kitty Hawk deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, VFA-27 was soon heavily involved in combat. As part of Carrier Air Wing 5, VFA-27 attacked command, control and communications sites, surface-to-surface missile batteries and an air traffic control radar near Basrah. At the Al Faw peninsula long range artillery guns and 155mm howitzers near Az Zubayr were targeted. The squadron flew hundreds of close air support and strike sorties against Iraqi forces. VFA-27 completed their transition to the F/A-18E Super Hornet in October 2004 at NAS Lemoore.

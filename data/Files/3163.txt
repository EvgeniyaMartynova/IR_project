Title: Thomas (surname)
Aspects: {'E. Thomas (disambiguation)'}

Thomas is a common surname of English, Welsh, Irish, Scottish, French, German, Dutch, and Danish origin.It derives from the medieval personal name, of Biblical origin, from Aramaic תאומא t'om'a, a byname meaning 'twin'. It was borne by one of the disciples of Christ, best known for his skepticism about Christ's resurrection (John 20:24–29). The th- spelling in English results from the initial letter of the name in the Greek New Testament being a theta. The English pronunciation as t rather than a dental fricative is the result of French influence from an early date. In Britain, the surname is widely distributed throughout the country, but especially common in Scotland, Cornwall, and Wales. Thomas is the ninth most common surname in the United Kingdom. It is found as a personal name among Christians in India, and in the United States; it is also used as a family name among the Saint Thomas Christian families from Kerala, South India.In the 1990 United States Census, Thomas was the twelfth most common surname, accounting for 0.3% of the population.In France, Thomas (pronounced [tɔma]) is the third most widespread surname after Martin and Bernard, with over 100,000 people with this name.

RMS Transylvania was a British Anchor Line passenger liner later converted into an armed merchant cruiser, pennant F56 during World War II. She was launched on 11 March 1925 and sunk by the German U-boat U-56 on 10 August 1940.
Transylvania was built in Glasgow, Scotland, by the Fairfield company, Yard No. 595. She was 552 feet (168 m) long and 70.2 feet (21.4 m) wide. The liner had twin propellers with a service speed of 15.5 knots (28.7 km/h; 17.8 mph). Transylvania had three funnels but only required one; three funnels were more visually appealing and attracted more passengers than her similar-looking fleetmates which only had one funnel each.
Transylvania was completed on 2 September 1925, and sailed from Glasgow to New York on her maiden voyage 10 days later. Transylvania could carry 279 in First Class, 344 in Second Class and 800 in Third Class.In September 1939, the liner was requisitioned as an armed merchant cruiser and on 10 August 1940, off Malin Head, Ireland she was torpedoed by U-56. Transylvania was being towed afterward but sank before reaching land. 36 lives were lost.

Title: Nissan GT-R
Aspects: {'R35'}

The Nissan GT-R is a sports car produced by Nissan, which was unveiled in 2007. It is the successor to the Skyline GT-R, although no longer part of the Skyline range itself, that name now being used for Nissan's luxury-sport market.


== History ==

Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline coupe called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This car proved to be iconic for Nissan and achieved much fame and success on both road and track.
The GT-R is an entirely new model, sharing little with the Skyline GT-R save its signature four round tail lights. Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder engine. But the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new VR38DETT V6 engine. Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35, or R35 for short (where CBA stands for the emissions standard prefix), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations.

The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname, Godzilla, originally given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.


=== Concepts ===
Nissan showed two GT-R concept cars at motor shows before it unveiled the production model: one at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2001, to preview a 21st-century GT-R; and a redesigned one, dubbed GT-R Proto, at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show. Officials said the production GT-R would be 80 to 90% based on the second concept.


== Production ==


=== Production model ===
The production version of the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, launching in the Japanese market on December 6, 2007. The U.S. official launch was seven months later on July 7, 2008. Universal Nissan in Los Angeles provided a customer with the delivery of a new GT-R, fresh from the production line at 12:01 am, on July 7, 2008. The Canadian launch was also in July 2008. Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.
The engines are built on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant. The cars are built at their Tochigi plant on a shared production line.


==== Design ====

Nissan chief creative officer, Shirō Nakamura, has likened the new GT-R to the giant robots of the Gundam series.
Nakamura stated: "The GT-R is unique because it is not simply a copy of a European-designed Sports car; it had to really reflect Japanese culture."
Nissan's American designers sculpted the rear three quarters of the vehicle, while their European designers sculpted the roofline.Polyphony Digital, creators of the Gran Turismo series of motor racing video games, were themselves involved in the development of the GT-R, having been contracted to design the GT-R's multifunction display.


===== Nissan PM platform =====
As of 2014 the GT-R was the only model built on Nissan's Premium Midship (PM) platform, an evolution of the Front Midship (FM) architecture introduced on the 2001 (V35) Skyline. It is a hybrid unibody assembled on ultra-low-tolerance jigs similar to those used in racecar construction. Alcoa aluminium is used for the hood, trunk lid and outer door skins, with die-cast aluminum front shock towers and inner door structures. Outer body panels are stamped using multiple-strike coining process for added rigidity and precision. The chassis is stiffened with a carbon-composite front crossmember/radiator support.


===== Exterior =====
Nissan developed a 6-stage paint process with double clear coat and chip-resistant paint for use in critical areas of the GT-R chassis. An optional liquid-effect finish employs a hand-polished 8-stage process with product-specific Super Silver metallic paint and three layers of clearcoat.


===== Optional features =====
The Premium trim for the GT-R has a body-colored rear spoiler whereas the Black Edition has a dry carbon-fibre rear spoiler. Both the Premium and Black Edition models are fitted with (LED) headlights, automatic on/off headlights, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights and brake lights, dual heated body-colour power wing mirrors, power folding wing mirrors, flush-mounted aluminium door handles, four 5-inch exhaust outlets with polished tips and UV-reducing solar glass.


==== Specifications ====

The Nissan GT-R is powered by the VR38DETT V6 engine, a 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu in) DOHC V6 with plasma transferred wire arc sprayed cylinder bores. Two parallel Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) turbochargers provide forced induction. Models manufactured between 2007 and 2010 are rated at a manufacturer-claimed engine output of 357 kW (485 PS; 479 hp) at 6,400 rpm and 434 lb⋅ft (588 N⋅m) at 3200–5,200 rpm. The engine also meets California Air Resources Board Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standards. 
The standard GT-R and the NISMO GT-R has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.26.A curb weight of 1,730 or 1,736 kg (3,814 or 3,827 lb) with side curtain airbags is achieved using a jig welded steel chassis with aluminium used for the hood, trunk, and doors. A rear mounted six-speed BorgWarner designed dual clutch semi-automatic transmission built by Aichi Machine Industry is used in conjunction with the ATTESA E-TS system to provide power to all four wheels and along with Nissan's Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC-R) to aid in stability. Three shift modes can also be selected for various conditions.
Beginning in 2010, engine power and torque were upgraded to 390 kW (530 PS; 523 hp) at 6,400 rpm and 612 N⋅m (451 lbf⋅ft) at 3,200–6,000 rpm respectively. Models produced in 2012 again featured improved engine output (406.5 kW (553 PS; 545 hp) at 6,400 rpm and 628 N⋅m (463 lbf⋅ft) at 3,200–5,800 rpm).


==== 2011 facelift ====

The revised GT-R features an engine with revised mapping, changes to valve timing, larger inlets and a revised exhaust system which boosts rated power to 406 kW (552 PS; 544 hp) and 612 N⋅m (451 lb⋅ft) of torque from 3,200 to 6,000 rpm. Changes also include a new more rigid front strut bar made from carbon composite, larger front brake rotors, new lighter and stiffer wheels, and revised Dunlop tires. Cosmetic changes include a new front bumper with integrated LEDs. The front bumper improves cooling to the radiator and front brakes while reducing drag. A new rear diffuser improves downforce and also includes additional rear cooling ducts. The interior was revised to improve the quality. The new model is offered with a new HDD CARWINGS navigation system with enhanced entertainment features and USB port with iPod connectivity. The revised GT-R went on sale in Japan from mid November 2010 and February 2011 in Europe, North America and other regions.


== Models ==


=== SpecV ===

Nissan introduced the GT-R SpecV on January 7, 2009 at the 2009 Tokyo Auto Salon. This version uses carbon fibre trim inside and out, and has no rear seats. In addition, a new colour was introduced limited to the SpecV, LAC Black Opal, The car came with Bridgestone Potenza RE070R tyres.The GT-R SpecV is powered by the standard twin-turbocharged 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu in) V6. A new high gear boost controller that allows a temporary increase in boost pressure to the IHI twin turbochargers, now larger than those on the standard GT-R, delivering 20 N⋅m (15 lb⋅ft) more torque than the standard GT-R in mid to high-range revs. Other mechanical changes include a titanium exhaust, Recaro bucket seats, reworked suspension, carbon ceramic brakes, and 20-inch (510 mm) Nismo wheels. Overall weight is decreased by 60 kg (132 lb) over the standard GT-R.Sales began in Japan on February 2, 2009 at seven preselected dealers staffed specially trained mechanics knowledgeable about racing circuit driving. The price was ¥15,750,000 (about US$160,000). The SpecV was also sold in Europe and the Middle East. A total of 110 SpecV were built, 77 for Japan, 24 for Europe, 1 for United Kingdom, 7 for Middle East and 1 additional car.
Auto Express tested the SpecV and posted a 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) time of 3.20 seconds, 1⁄4 mile (400 m) time of 11.5 seconds, pulled 1.12 g on the skidpad and 120.2 km/h in the slalom. An earlier tested Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1 resulted in an identical slalom speed but a lower 1.06 g on the skidpad.


=== Black Edition ===
The Black Edition comes with exclusive 20-inch RAYS wheels and a carbon fibre rear spoiler. Recaro racing seats were commissioned specifically by Nissan for the Black Edition. The interior is finished in red and black leather, but a beige colour known as 'Pale Ivory' is also available. No mechanical changes are made from the standard GT-R.


=== Track Edition ===
For the 2014 model year, Nissan introduced a limited production Track Edition of GT-R which deletes the rear seats (saving 10 kg (22 lb) over the Black Edition) and adds stiffer suspension, carbon fibre air inlets, improved brake cooling, a unique front spoiler, and new black and gray leather Recaro front seats.Motor Trend tested the Track Edition GT-R can accelerate 0–97 km/h (0-60 mph) time at same 2.7 seconds, 1⁄4 mile (400 m) time in 11.0 seconds at 201 km/h (125.1 mph), and the German car magazine sport auto tested the top speed of the Track Edition GT-R, and the car achieved a top speed of 333 km/h (208 mph).


=== GT-R NISMO ===

Nissan introduced a NISMO Edition GT-R for model year 2014. US price increased almost 50% to US$149,990.
In the new model, power increases to 441 kW (600 PS; 591 hp) at 6,800 rpm and 652 N⋅m (481 lb⋅ft) of torque at 3,200-5,800 rpm. The 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) time changed to 2.5 seconds. The gear-ratios did not change in the dual-clutch transmission. The fuel tank capacity is 19.5 US gal; 16.3 imp gal (74 L). Additional front and rear brake cooling ducts are added, and a full NISMO tuned suspension is installed, including a hollow 17.3 mm (0.68 in) rear stabilizer bar from the NISMO performance division.
Special edition forged alloys by RAYS in 20-inch size are included. The standard GT-R's aluminium trunk lid is swapped out for a full carbon fibre panel and additional spot welds and adhesive help strengthen the chassis. A front splitter with carbon fibre air ducts up front add to the special NISMO full aerodynamic package, while a large racing style carbon wing completes the rear.
Inside, the NISMO edition has special seats with black and red color treatment made with synthetic suede. The instrument binnacle and steering wheel are also covered in synthetic suede. The Bose stereo system does not have active noise control. The gauges have some red colour treatment as well. NISMO-specific options are low-gloss matte gray paint and a full titanium exhaust with additional heatsinks. These changes, in aggregate, reduce weight by 17 kg (38 lb), which is the reason that the NISMO GT-R accelerates even faster than before.
At the April 2019 New York Auto Show, Nissan unveiled the 2020 model year GT-R NISMO and the 50th anniversary GT-R for the GT-R's 50th anniversary. Updates to the NISMO GT-R include a new "R mode" gear shifting setting to shift gears more quickly, new turbochargers from the GT3 race car to improve the acceleration, RAYS 20-inch wheels, GT3-inspired fender vents, lightweight carbon ceramic brakes, new re-tuned suspension and the roof, hood and fenders are made with carbon fibre to reduce the weight. Nissan says new NISMO GT-R is faster and more track focused than previous models, and the weight has been reduced by 20 kg compared to the 2017 model year NISMO GT-R.On June 2019, Nissan's Hiroshi Tamura visited Motor Trend for an interview to talk about the 2020 Nissan GT-R NISMO. He said the lap time of the Nurburgring Nordschleife will be quicker by 5 seconds because of a 5% improvement in cornering force and better braking performance.


=== GT-R NISMO N-Attack ===
A special edition of the GT-R Nismo which is outfitted after the purchase of the Nismo model. This package includes the parts which the original GT-R Nismo has when racing for the fastest lap time on the Nürburgring track. For Japan, installation is handled by NISMO Omori factory. For North America, the conversion is handled by Stillen.

		


=== GT-R50 ===

To celebrate the GT-R's 50th anniversary, Nissan has announced that, in 2019, they will introduce a limited-production GT-R called the GT-R50. Only fifty of these cars will be produced. The GT-R50 shares its powertrain with the GT-R NISMO but is rated at 522 kW (710 PS; 700 hp) and 780 N⋅m (575 lb⋅ft) of torque.Upgrades to the engine include large diameter turbochargers shared with the GT3 specification GT-R, a heavy duty crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods, a modified intake system, a new exhaust system, a recalibrated gearbox and a reinforced differential. The rear suspension system uses Bilstein continuously variable dampers and the car uses carbon ceramic brakes. The GT-R50 comes standard in 21-inch carbon fibre wheels with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres.
The design of the body work is a result of a collaboration between Italdesign and Nissan, with the former celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2018. Construction of the body work is mainly of aluminium and carbon fibre.
The design was developed by a team of Nissan's European and American designers and has been described as a "car within a car". The front and back sections are designed so they appear to be emerging from the bodywork. Key design elements include a redesigned rear section, stretched LED headlamps at the front, a power bulge on the hood, a lowered roof line and "Samurai blade" cooling ducts behind the front wheels.


== Performance ==

Nissan states the GT-R can attain a top speed of 315 km/h (196 mph), Motor Trend recorded a top speed of 313.8 km/h (195.0 mph). In tests the original production model was shown to be capable of achieving 0-97 km/h (60 mph) times as low as 3.2 seconds using "launch control". Owners expressed concern that duplicating the times achieved in these tests would void their factory warranty. Nissan's chief vehicle engineer Kazutoshi Mizuno has indicated that he has never used the term "launch control", which refers to the act of turning off vehicle dynamic control (VDC) and launching the car at around 4,500 rpm. However, Nissan's director of product planning John Wiener stated in an interview with Jay Leno that "we (Nissan) actually offer a 'launch mode'". The GT-R user's manual states that turning off the VDC is only meant for escaping low-traction situations such as mud or snow. Nissan has re-programmed the 2010 model year GT-R to reduce the engine speed at launch to around 3,000-3,500 rpm with VDC enabled, which is meant to improve acceleration times. The new programming was also installed on old 2009 vehicles still in Nissan's inventory, and is available for existing 2009 vehicles.The updated GT-R now has a launch mode called "R-Mode Start". The system allows a maximum of 4 consecutive hard launches before locking itself out, after which it can be unlocked by driving normally for 2.4 km (1.5 mi). The increased engine output of later models combined with the "R-Mode Start" has lowered the 0-97 km/h (60 mph) time to 2.7 seconds.Motor Trend achieved a standing quarter-mile time of 11.6 seconds at 190 km/h (120 mph) using a US-spec 2009 model year GT-R. Autocar achieved a 0-160 km/h (100 mph) time of 8.5 seconds.The 2017 model year GT-R can accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph) in the same time of 2.7 seconds and achieve a 400 m (1⁄4 mi) time of 10.8 seconds at 204 km/h (127 mph). In 2017, the German car magazine Auto Bild tested the top speed of the 2017 model year GT-R and reached a top speed of 328 km/h (204 mph).The sport auto magazine tested the GT-R on the Hockenheimring circuit and recorded a lap time of 1:10.7 during the "supertest".With a manufacturer claimed lap time by using the 2009 model year GT-R of 7:26.7 minutes on the base model's Dunlop tyres and previously 7:29 min on standard Japanese market tyres, the GT-R is currently one of the fastest handbuilt cars to lap the Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit. Porsche has claimed Nissan overstated the GT-R's performance in September 2008. Porsche claimed to have conducted a test of a factory stock, European market GT-R and achieved a slower time (of 7:54), apparently implying that the car isn't as fast around this public road as Nissan claims and/or that their driver isn't as talented as Nissan's. Nissan disputed the former and implied the latter claim in October 2008.

Testing by Drivers Republic of a GT-R and 911 GT2 in stock form resulted in times of 7:56 for the GT-R and 7:49 for the GT2 respectively in partially damp conditions. While the tester had no doubt that the GT2 could achieve the factory time of 7:32, he couldn't imagine the customer GT-R going faster than 7:41 in spite of the 7:29 factory claim.The German magazine sport auto achieved a time of 7:50 on the Nürburgring with a car supplied to them by Nissan during an initial short test in 2007 in partially damp condition. In 2009, in a full "super test" sport auto achieved a time of 7:38 minutes on the Nürburgring with a standard GT-R driven by Horst von Saurma, identical to a later "super test" Corvette ZR1 time. In a first test with the facelifted GT-R model, 'sport auto' recorded a lap time of 7:34 on the Nürburgring with a standard GT-R driven by Horst von Saurma.In September 2010, Nissan's sets a Nürburgring lap time using the 2011 model year GT-R with a new design. Driven by GT-R's development driver Toshio Suzuki. and the car set a lap time of 7.24.22 minutes.According to Nissan the GT-R improved its Nürburgring lap time in October 2012 to 7 minutes and 19.1 seconds by due to the 2014 model year improvements. This made it the 9th fastest ever production car around the Nürburgring at the time. Nissan claimed that it lost half a second in traffic, making a potential lap time of 7 minutes and 18.6 seconds.On September 30, 2013, the Nissan GT-R NISMO N-Attack, driven by Michael Krumm in a test conducted by Nissan on the Nürburgring, set a lap time of 7:08.679 minutes and achieved a top speed of 310 km/h (193 mph) on the straight, making it the fastest road-legal production vehicle around the track at the time.On December 8, 2017, in a test conducted by Nissan for 50th anniversary of the GT-R, a 2018 model year Nissan GT-R NISMO, driven by Kazuo Shimizu, set a lap time of 1.00.293 minutes on the Tsukuba Circuit – making it the fastest road-legal production vehicle around the track.

=== Super GT ===

Nismo, the motorsport arm of Nissan, entered the Nissan GT-R in the Super GT race series in the GT500 class for the 2008 season, replacing the 350Z.The 2008 GT500 version of the car has a completely different drivetrain compared to the production car. The race car is upgraded to a VK45DE 4.5-litre naturally aspirated V8 instead of the twin-turbocharge VR38DETT V6 engine. It uses a 6 speed sequential manual gearbox and a rear-wheel-drive layout from its predecessor, the 350Z race car.

A prototype was spotted testing around the Suzuka Circuit as well as Fuji Speedway in Japan. The car went on to win the opening race of the 2008 Super GT season at Suzuka scoring a one-two finish for Nissan. The dominant performances in the opening race has led to all GT-Rs being applied a 50 kg weight penalty in addition to the race weight penalty under the Special Adjustment of Performance under the Super GT regulations. In race two, the GT-R repeated their 1–2 result in Suzuka despite the race winning car of team Nismo carrying a 100 kg weight penalty making it only the 3rd team in JGTC/Super GT history to do so. The last time this feat was achieved was 10 years ago by Nismo Skyline GT-R racing under the same number 23. Despite the weight handicap, it won the drivers' championship in the 2008 season through the Xanavi Nismo GT-R driven by Satoshi Motoyama and Benoît Tréluyer, though they only came third in the teams' championship. It also won 7 out of 9 races driven by 4 different teams using GT-Rs.The GT500 version scored 4 victories in the 2009 Japanese SUPER GT Series GT 500 class.
In 2010, the VK45DE 4.5-litre engine was replaced by a newly developed 3.4-litre engine (VRH34A).It also is the 2011 and 2012 Champion. Team Mola GT-R with drivers Ronnie Quintarelli and Masataka Yanagida got back to back championships in both Team and Driver in the Super GT500.In 2014, the Super GT regulations were aligned with those of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, and so the V8 engine was replaced with a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder turbocharged engine.


=== FIA GT/GT1 World Championship ===

On February 27, 2009, Nismo announced a partnership with British racing team Gigawave Motorsports to enter a GT-R in four races in the 2009 FIA GT Championship season. The entry did not compete for championship points, but was used by Nismo to refine the performance of the GT-R for future customer teams to use the car in the planned FIA GT1 World Championship in 2010. Nismo driver Michael Krumm and Gigawave driver Darren Turner would co-drive the GT1 GT-R.The Sumo Power GT-R won the 2010 RAC Tourist Trophy at Silverstone Circuit as part of the FIA GT1 World Championship on May 2, 2010.
The 2011 season saw Swiss Racing Team switch to Lamborghini which left Sumo Power running four GT-Rs, two under the Sumo Power GT name and two under JR Motorsports. JR Motorsports with the drivers Michael Krumm and Lucas Luhr won the Drivers Championship for the 2011 season, gaining 3 wins and 1 pole position in 10 races.

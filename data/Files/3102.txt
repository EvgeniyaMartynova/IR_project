It has tiny dark green leaves no more than 30 mm (1.2 inches) long, densely packed together and covered in a thick grayish wool. The plant produces flower heads one at a time, which look like tiny pale yellow daisies less than a centimeter across, with up to 13 yellow or purple ray florets and up to 14 yellow disc florets. The fruits are shiny black achenes with white fringe, each a few millimeters long.The genus was named for the American botanist Daniel Cady Eaton, 1834â€“1885.

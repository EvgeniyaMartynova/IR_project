Wacol is located on the east bank of the Brisbane River, 18 kilometres (11 mi) south-west of the Brisbane central business district, on the Brisbane-Ipswich railway line. It is served by Wacol railway station.


== History ==

The suburb takes its name from its railway station. 
Wolston House was opened in 1852.  Still intact today the building is the only surviving early Brisbane River settlement.  The building was planned to be demolished however the National Trust of Queensland intervened to save the building.  Major conservation work was undertaken.
The Wolston railway station was opened on 8 October 1874, taking its name from Wolston House. However, the name caused confusion with the Wilston railway station, so it was renamed on 8 July 1927 to Wacol railway station. Wacol is a coined word from weigh coal, as the principal purpose of the station was coal handling.A portion of Wacol comes from the Wolston Estate, consisting of 54 farms on an area of 3000 acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901.  Wolston Estate is the property of M. B. Goggs, whose father obtained the land forty years previously in the 1860s and after whom Goggs Road is named. Only three of the farms sold at the original auction.The suburb played host to the American military during World War II, who constructed Camp Columbia in 1942; after the war, control of the facility was transferred to the Australian government for use as a migrant reception and training centre.

Title: Virginia's 2nd congressional district
Aspects: {'VA2'}

Virginia's second congressional district is a U.S. congressional district in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It currently encompasses all of Accomack, Northampton and York counties, all of the cities of Virginia Beach and Williamsburg and parts of the cities of Norfolk and Hampton, although its boundaries changed greatly over the centuries (it initially encompassed what became West Virginia after the American Civil War). Republican Scott Rigell defeated Democrat Glenn Nye in the November 2, 2010 election, and took his seat January 3, 2011 until 2017, when he was succeeded by Scott Taylor. In the November 6, 2018 election, Democrat Elaine Luria defeated Republican Scott Taylor. It is now considered one of Virginia's most competitive congressional districts.

Spartina gracilis is a species of grass known by the common name alkali cordgrass. It is native to western North America from northwestern Canada through the western United States and eastern California, and into central Mexico. It grows in moist alkaline habitat, such as evaporating streams and shorelines, alkali flats, and inland marshes.
It is a perennial grass growing from short rhizomes. It produces usually single, slender stems reaching a meter in maximum height. The leaves are flat and ridged, and may roll in when new. The inflorescence is a narrow, dense, spike-like stick of branches appressed together, the unit reaching up to 25 centimeters long. The branches are lined with spikelets.

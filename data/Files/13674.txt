The US Bank Building is a high-rise building located in Boise, Idaho, formerly the tallest  building in the state. Completed in 1978 and renovated in 2004, it rises 267 feet (81 m) spanning 19 floors. It was the tallest building in the state for over thirty years, until surpassed by the 323-foot (98 m) Eighth & Main Building.
Originally "Idaho First Plaza," the building was the headquarters of the Idaho First National Bank, which was founded in 1867. Built by EmKay Development and Realty Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Boise-based Morrison-Knudsen Co., it opened in September 1978.
Following acquisitions in neighboring states, IFNB changed its name to West One Bank in 1989, and was acquired by U.S. Bank of Portland in 1995.In 2000, the building was purchased by the property development firm Unico.
The condensed address of the building is 101 S. Capitol Blvd. Boise, ID 83702.
The building does not have a 13th floor. The floors are numbered one through twenty and skips thirteen. The reason for leaving out thirteen is because of the superstition of the number thirteen. According to records once kept by the Otis Elevator Company, at one point 85 percent of the world's skyscrapers didn't have a 13th floor.

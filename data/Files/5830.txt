All Skrewed Up is the debut studio album by the British rock band Skrewdriver, released in 1977. It was issued with four different sleeve colours - green, orange, yellow, and pale purple. It was later re-released in 1990 as "The Early Years" with five additional tracks, including the singles "Unbeliever" and "Streetfight", originally issued on the German release. The Early Years is the only official release of the All Skrewed Up tracks on CD.
Ian Stuart Donaldson was the only member of the record's line-up to play on future Skrewdriver releases.The album contains none of the neo-Nazi-themed and white power-themed lyrics that Skrewdriver used later.

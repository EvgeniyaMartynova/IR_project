Title: Farman F.300
Aspects: {'F300'}

The Farman F.300 and F.310 were airliners built in France in the early 1930s. They were high-wing strut braced monoplanes with fixed tailskid undercarriage with a trimotor layout popular with several manufacturers of the time. The cockpit and passenger compartment were fully enclosed. Most saw service in  Farman's own airline, whose twelve F.300 variants made up half its fleet in 1931.
One variant, the F.302, was specially built as a single-engine machine to make an attempt at a number of world records. On 9 March 1931, Jean Réginensi and Marcel Lalouette set new distance and duration records over a closed circuit with a 2,000 kg payload, flying 2,678 km (1,664 mi) in 17 hours. Another, the F.304 was built as a special trimotor for Marcel Goulette to make a long-distance flight the same month from Paris to Tananarive and back.
The F.310 prototype of a floatplane version of the same basic design, was destroyed while landing during trials, and no further examples were built.

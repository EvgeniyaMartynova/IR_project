Title: Mazda Z engine
Aspects: {'Z5'}

The Mazda Z-series is a smaller gasoline inline-four engine ranging in displacements from 1.3 L to 1.6 L. They are the evolution of the cast-iron block B-engine.
The Z-engine has 16-valves operated by dual overhead camshafts, which are in turn driven by a timing belt. The block of the 98-02 Z5, ZM and ZL engine is cast iron same as the earlier B series of engines.  
Other Z engines have aluminum alloy block and head, with cast-iron cylinder liners.
The block features split upper and lower block assembly for added strength and rigidity, special long intake manifold for added torque, S-VT continuous variable valve timing, and a stainless steel 4:1 exhaust header.
In 2011, Mazda started to introduce the SkyActiv G-engine as a new, more economical option with vehicles that also ran the Mazda Z-engine. Production was finally halted in 2014, being the last year of the Demio/Mazda2, Verisa as well as Axela/Mazda3 of their generations. From here on in, Mazda moved on to the full SkyActiv architecture vehicles including running only the aforementioned SkyActiv G-engine but now offering it in also larger displacements, as well as a new SkyActiv D-engine turbo-diesel. 


== Z5 ==
The 1.5 L (1,489 cc) 92 hp (69 kW; 93 PS) Z5-DE was used in the 1995-1998 Mazda Protegé, Mazda Lantis (Astina) and in Mazda Familia Neo (1994–1997). Bore and stroke were 75.3 mm × 83.6 mm (2.96 in × 3.29 in). 
The Z5 engine was the first iteration for all newer Z-series lines of Mazda engines. The Z series of engine are totally new design but based on B-series. The block, block internals and oil-pan are similar to the B series of engines but the DOHC head is a completely new design.
The block is cast iron, the oil-pan is a 2-piece design with an upper aluminum and lower stamped steel, piston oil squirters are standard. The cylinder head was a compact design with round intake and exhaust ports. JDM versions produce 97 PS (71 kW; 96 hp) and 110 PS (81 kW; 108 hp). There was also lean-burn version introduced in August 1995; this model produces 94 PS (69 kW; 93 hp) and sees gas mileage improvements of ten to fifteen percent in the standard Japanese test cycle.


== ZJ ==

The 1.3 L (1,348 cc) ZJ 74 mm × 78.4 mm (2.91 in × 3.09 in) is available with either continuous cam-phasing VVT ZJ-VE 91 hp (68 kW; 92 PS) or a high-efficiency Miller cycle ZJ-VEM 90 hp (67 kW; 91 PS).
Applications:

2003–present Mazda Demio ZJ-VE
2007–present Mazda Demio ZJ-VEM


== ZY ==
1.5 L (1,498 cc) 111 hp (83 kW; 113 PS) ZY-VE 78 mm × 78.4 mm (3.07 in × 3.09 in)

Used in the Demio/Mazda2 (2002-2014), Verisa and Axela/Mazda3


== ZL ==
1.5 L (1,498 cc) 88 hp (66 kW; 89 PS) EEC, 110 hp (82 kW; 112 PS) JIS, ZL-DE 78 mm × 78.4 mm (3.07 in × 3.09 in)
1.5 L (1,498 cc) 130 hp (97 kW; 132 PS) JIS ZL-VE 78 mm × 78.4 mm (3.07 in × 3.09 in)
The 1.5 L ZL-VE makes more power than the slightly larger 1.6 L Z6/M-DE its due to variable valve timing on the intake cam (S-VT).
Applications:

1999-2003 Mazda Familia


== Z6/M ==
1.6 L (1,598 cc) 105 hp (78 kW; 106 PS) ZM-DE 78 mm × 83.6 mm (3.07 in × 3.29 in)
The ZM engine, also known as the Z6, has an identical bore yet slightly longer stroke than the ZL as well as a revised head with round intake and exhaust ports. It has exactly the same bore and stroke as the previous generation B6.
The 1.5 L (1,498 cc) 130 hp (97 kW; 132 PS) ZL-VE and 1.6 L (1,598 cc) 105 hp (78 kW; 106 PS) ZM-DE are closely related engines with an equal bore 78 mm (3.1 in) and share some major parts. The ZL has a stroke of 78.4 mm (3.09 in) whilst the ZM has 83.6 mm (3.29 in).
Applications:

1998-2002 Mazda Familia
2003-2013 Mazda3

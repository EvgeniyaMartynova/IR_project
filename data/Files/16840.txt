Title: Changhe Z-18
Aspects: {'Z8'}

The Changhe Z-18 is  a medium transport helicopter developed by Changhe Aircraft Industries Corporation (CAIC) to replace the Z-8.


== Design and development ==
The Z-18 is a single-rotor helicopter with tail rotor and a non-retractable landing gear, thought to be based on the Avicopter AC313, an updated design based on the earlier Harbin Z-8. A naval version of the Z-18 was first revealed on board the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning. In 2014, the army version of Z-18 was revealed in Chinese army publications.The Z-18 replaces the Z-8's distinctive boat hull lower fuselage with a tail ramp for offloading small vehicles; it also has a glass cockpit and a lightweight hull made with extensive use of composites and titanium as well as composite main rotor blades. It is powered by three WZ-6C turboshafts, giving it a maximum takeoff weight of 13.8 tonnes (30,360 lb) and enabling it to carry 27 troops or five tonnes (11,000 lb) of cargo with a range of up to 1,000 km (620 mi).Several versions are planned including utility/VIP transport, airborne early warning (AEW), and anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The Z-18F ASW variant is equipped with a dipping sonar, up to 32 sonobuoys, and 4 Yu-7 torpedoes. It has a chin-mounted surface search radar and is probably fitted with a datalink similar to the Ka-28 enabling it to operate as a third-party targeting director for anti-ship missiles. The Z-18J AEW variant has a radar antenna fitted in place of the loading ramp that is lowered for operation when airborne. Because of its size there are few People's Liberation Army Navy vessels capable of operating the Z-18; some that are include Liaoning, Type 071 amphibious transport dock, Type 075 landing helicopter dock, and Type 055 destroyer.In January 2018, China released video footage indicating that the Z-8G Gaoyuan (Plateau) had entered service with the People's Liberation Army Ground Force. It may replace the S-70C-2 and Z-8B version for operations in high-altitude areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet, as in flight tests it was able to reach as high as 9,000 m (29,528 ft). Some Z-8Gs are fitted with a SATCOM fairing on the tailboom, aft of the engine exhausts.

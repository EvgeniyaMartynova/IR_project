The larger leaves are located in the ground-level rosette; those on the stem are small and thready.The upper stem is an inflorescence bearing widely spaced flowers on long pedicels. Each flower is a cup of four bright yellow petals, sometimes with red speckles near the bases. Behind the flowers are four smaller sepals, which are greenish and reflexed back against the pedicel. The fruit is a cylindrical capsule 4 to 10 centimeters long.

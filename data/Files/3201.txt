== Critical reception ==
Alex Henderson of AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, "This is the electronic dance music that preceded the rise of techno, house, and industrial noise, and it came at a time when hip-hop was in its infancy and the rave subculture had yet to be invented." He described it as "a historically interesting LP that anyone who has enjoyed electronic dance rhythms needs to check out." Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club wrote, "The title track includes some of Moroder's finest vocoder work while songs like 'I Wanna Rock You' and 'Baby Blue' see Moroder delivering some of his most polished disco efforts, removed from the rawness of those Donna Summer tracks but still very indebted to them."

== Summary ==
The special is hosted by that night’s guest stars Tony Danza and Annie Potts celebrating 50 years of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's partnership in animation. This is the first animated project to be broadcast in Dolby Surround sound system.
It covers their years working for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio and then the history of Hanna-Barbera Productions which was set up in 1957. It features footage and clips from the studio's various cartoons along with new animated/live-action wraparounds and a behind-the-scenes on the then-upcoming newcomer, Jetsons: The Movie.
The special was dedicated to the loving memory of Daws Butler, who died sorrowfully during this production and was also the last television and film project of both Mel Blanc and George O'Hanlon, who died before the special's telecast. Turner Broadcasting System, which owned TNT, would later purchase Hanna-Barbera in 1991.

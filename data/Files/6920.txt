Title: Scania K series
Aspects: {'K series'}

The Scania K series is a series of chassis in Scania's city bus and coach range with longitudinally, straight-up mounted engine at the rear, replacing the K- (K94, K114, K124) and L-type (L94) chassis of the 4 series. The K series was first presented on Busworld 2005 in Kortrijk, Belgium and models were available from 2006.

Note: One might think that double-decker coaches are designated as (e.g.) K 440 ED6x2*4NI. But they still use K EB for some reason.


== Engines ==
When introduced, the K series was available with Euro IV-compliant 8.9-litre (8867 cc) 5-cylinder engines (DC9) with output of 230 hp (1050 Nm), 270 hp (1250 Nm) and 310 hp (1550 Nm) as well as the 11.7-litre (11705 cc) 6-cylinder engines (DC12) with output of 340 hp (1700 Nm), 380 hp (1900 Nm), 420 hp (2100 Nm) or 470 hp (2200 Nm), the latter being a DT12 turbo-compound engine. For the 5- and 6-cylinder engines Scania is using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to fulfill the legal Euro emission standards.
In 2008 Scania released upgraded Euro V engines in order to meet these regulations. The 5-cylinder DC9 (later DC09) engines featured a larger bore and displace 9.3-litres (9291  cc) instead of 8.9-litres. The new DC13 engines feature both a larger bore and a longer stroke and therefore displace 12.7-litres (12742  cc) instead of 11.7-litres. Some engines also received slight performance improvements, for example the DC9 engine that outputs 310 hp (1550 Nm) was upgraded to 320 hp (1600 Nm).
With the introduction of Euro VI engines in 2013, the DC09 outputs 250 hp (1250 Nm), 280 hp (1400 Nm), 320 hp (1600 Nm) and 360 hp (1700 Nm), while the DC13 outputs 410 hp (2150 Nm), 450 hp (2350 Nm) and 490 hp (2550 Nm). Euro III, IV and V engines are still available for export markets.
For alternative fuels, the 9.3-litre was available as the OC9 CNG engine with power outputs of 270 hp (1100 Nm) and 305 hp (1250 Nm), which from the introduction of Euro VI was replaced by the OC09 with power outputs of 280 hp (1350 Nm) and 340 hp (1600 Nm). The 8.9-litre is available as the ethanol fueled DC9 E02 with a power output of 270 hp (1200 Nm).

=== Australia ===

Numerous bus operators in Australia operate the Scania K-series chassis.
In Melbourne, CDC Melbourne, Transdev Melbourne and Ventura Bus Lines all operate fleets of K230UBs. In Geelong, CDC Geelong operates a number of K230UBs and McHarry's Buslines also operate a number of K270UBs, K270IBs, K280UBs, K280IBs, K320IBs and one K310IB.
In New South Wales, Busways and ComfortDelGro Australia's Hillsbus and Hunter Valley Buses subsidiaries have significant numbers of K230UB, K280UB and K310UB in their fleet. Transdev NSW also operates a fleet of K230UB while State Transit operate K280UB & K310UB.In Canberra, ACTION operates over 150 K320UBs, including 26 Euro V K320UB 6x2*4 buses.In Adelaide, Light-City Buses has 112 K230UB units, of which 98 are used on the O-Bahn Busway. Greater-northern and greater-southern, and hills operator SouthLink have 34 K230UB units + 13 KUB units for use in the Adelaide Hills.


=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, several operators have Scania K-series UB urban buses. Because of the additional weight of the 9-litre engine compared to the 7-litre units offered by other manufacturers, many (though not all) Scania urban buses are specified as 6x2 rather than 4x2. This helps reduce the operator's liability for road user charges, which are calculated by vehicle weight. Scania K-series urban buses may have tag axles at lengths where buses of other makes would not, e.g. NZ Bus's 2100 and 2200 series at approximately 12.0 m and only 42 seats.
Scania K-series urban buses pioneered steerable tag axles in New Zealand, which became a requirement for buses between 12.6 m and 13.5 m in length. Because Scania K-series buses had a longer rear overhang than competing makes, the allowable overhang with a steerable tag axle was increased from 4.25 m to 4.5 m. The Scania K280 UB 6x2*4 and K320 UB 6x2*4 have been popular chassis for operators building high-capacity single-deck buses. New Zealand's first double-deck bus in regular urban service was a Gemilang-bodied Scania K310 UD 6x2*4.

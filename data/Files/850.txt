Title: Buff-tailed coronet
Aspects: {'B. flavescens'}

The buff-tailed coronet (Boissonneaua flavescens) is a species of hummingbird from the family Trochilidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Distinguishing characteristics are the short bill, glittering green coloration, and buffy color under the remiges (flight feathers) and rectrices (tail feathers). Like other hummingbirds, the buff-tailed coronet is often found in mid-level forest to canopy searching for flowers with nectar and some insects. This bird is commonly found from 1500–2400 meters above sea level.


== Description ==

The buff-tailed coronet has only slight sexual dimorphism. The female is scaled with white feathers mostly throughout the chin and throat, and some on the belly. Prominent feather colorations are iridescent green with darker wing tips, and buffy hues under the wing and tail feathers. On the face, there is an obvious white post ocular spot on each side. Puffy white “boots” are present at the thighs, an orange tuft at the shoulder, and a short, dark bill. Average size for a buff-tailed coronet is 13.2-13.5 cm with a bill length of 1.8–2 cm.The buff-tailed coronet and fawn-breasted brilliant (Heliodoxa rubinoides) are commonly confused due to their similar posterior coloration. The fawn-breasted brilliant has more buff coloration on its breast and underbelly.


== Vocalization ==
The vocalization of the male buff-tailed coronet is a repetitive “chip” noise. This song is usually used when the bird is perched in open areas of the sub-canopy, being within suitable distance from other hummingbirds. The song has also been recorded at feeders with multiple hummingbirds present.


== Habitat ==
The bird occupies many types of habitat, including cloud forest, elfin forest, and páramo. It occurs at 1500 to 2400 meters in elevation.


== Behavior ==
The buff-tailed coronet may share feeding areas with other hummingbirds, but it can be aggressive.

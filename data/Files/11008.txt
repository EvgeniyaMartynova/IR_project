=== 2014 update ===


==== Audi Q3 (2014-2016) ====

In 2014 the Audi Q3 received a facelift for the 2015 model year. The grille on the 2015 version has a wider chrome surround to it, which touches the headlights at each side. The lower air vents have been enlarged slightly, and the lights themselves have re-profiled LEDs to give the car a more recognisable look in the dark. The wheel arch surrounds and door sills are body coloured on the base model (they used to be black plastic), as is the rear bumper design, which sits below subtly reshaped lower tail light clusters. Also there are new alloy wheel designs to finish off the refresh.
The changes to the inside are even more difficult to spot than those on the outside. Styling-wise, the only thing of note is a new steering wheel design. There is now the option to specify blind spot and lane departure warning systems if you wish. The boot remains the same volume at 420 litres, expanding to 1,325 litres when the rear seats are folded flat.
Across the range, each engine has seen an improvement in performance, efficiency or both. The 1.4-litre turbo petrol now features cylinder-on-demand technology, which saves fuel by shutting down a couple of cylinders when less power is needed.
The 2.0 TFSI petrol units now produce 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) and 220 PS (162 kW; 217 hp). The two diesel motors receive boosts of eight and four horsepower, to 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) and 184 PS (135 kW; 181 hp) respectively. The more performance-oriented RS Q3 gains a sizeable 30 PS (22 kW; 30 hp) over the old model, and torque now sits at 332 lb⋅ft (450 N⋅m), marginally up from the old version.The vehicle was unveiled in 2014 North American International Auto Show.

== Second generation (2018–present) ==
The second-generation Audi Q3, built on the MQB platform, (Model MQB27A2) was officially unveiled on July 25, 2018. On the Nürburgring race track, a sports version is tested, which will be called SQ3, and then there will be an even more powerful version of RS Q3. A Sportback version was revealed in July 2019. The Q3 Sportback is marginally lower, less wide and longer, with different bumpers, side skirts and body cladding. Aimed at the BMW X2, the lower roofline and raked rear hatch result in less headroom, and 0.14 less cubic meters (5 cubic feet) when the rear seats are folded. In Europe, the Sportback will gain a new base 1.5L hybrid turbo four for the 2020 model year. The RS Q3 variant was also revealed in September 2019; it has the same engine as the first-generation RS Q3 albeit with more power.

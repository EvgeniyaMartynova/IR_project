Title: Curcuma aromatica
Aspects: {'C. aromatica'}

Curcuma aromatica (common name: wild turmeric) is a member of the genus Curcuma belonging to the family Zingiberaceae. Botanically close to Curcuma australasica, wild turmeric has been widely used as a cosmetic herbal in South Asia and nearby regions.


== Description ==
The wild turmeric is one among the 80 members of the plant family Zingiberaceae. The perennial foliage dies down in late autumn and the rhizomes remain dormant in winter. The inflorescence appears in early spring from the base of the rhizomes. During summer monsoon season and the immediately following weeks, the plant grows fast and vigorously. The stalk grows to about 20–30 centimetres (7.9–11.8 in) tall, and is crowned with enlarged coloured bracts with pink tips. Leaves often appear even after the flowers. When in full growth the plants can reach a height of about 40 cm (16 in) tall.


== Habitat ==
This species is found in the south Asian region, predominantly in eastern Himalayas and in the warm forests of the Western Ghats (India).


== Uses ==
Wild turmeric has rhizomes with a peculiar fragrance and cream color. The rhizomes are often used in cosmetic herbal medicines and as a culinary ingredient in limited quantities as a food flavor. Leaves are broad and very decorative, elliptic with a leaf stem running as long to the tip of the blade. A fresh stalk with flowers and leaves, cut to proper size and shape, can be used as a floral indoor decoration in vase for up to 10 days.

Title: GER Class E22
Aspects: {'E22'}

The GER Class E22 was a class of twenty 0-6-0 steam tank locomotives designed by James Holden for the Great Eastern Railway.  They passed to the London and North Eastern Railway at the grouping in 1923 and received the LNER classification J65.


== History ==
These had 4-foot-0-inch (1.219 m) coupled wheels, 14-by-20-inch (356 by 508 mm) cylinders and were lighter than the T18 (LNER J66) class. 

They were reboilered between 1889 and 1912. The Macallan variable blastpipe was removed from 1924. They ran as 2-4-0Ts on the Fenchurch Street to Blackwall service and were sometimes known as Blackwall Tanks. They operated on the Stoke Ferry, Eye and Mid-Suffolk Light Railway branches. Withdrawals started in 1930, and by 1937 fifteen had been withdrawn, but there were no more retirements for ten years. In 1944 the five surviving locomotives were renumbered 8211–8215 in order of construction. These last five were withdrawn between 1947 and 1956, when the class became extinct.

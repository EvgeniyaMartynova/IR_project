Title: Hollow matrix
Aspects: {'H-matrix'}

In mathematics, a hollow matrix may refer to one of several related classes of matrix.


== Definitions ==


=== Sparse ===
A hollow matrix may be one with "few" non-zero entries: that is, a sparse matrix.


=== Diagonal entries all zero ===
A hollow matrix may be a square matrix whose diagonal elements are all equal to zero. The most obvious example is the real skew-symmetric matrix.  Other examples are the adjacency matrix of a finite simple graph; a distance matrix or Euclidean distance matrix.
If A is an n×n hollow matrix, then the elements of A are given by

                    n

    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A_{n\times n}&=(a_{ij}),\\a_{ij}&=0\quad {\text{if}}\ i=j,\ 1\leq i,j\leq n.\end{aligned}}}
  In other words, any square matrix that takes the form

==== Properties ====
The trace of A is zero.
If A represents a linear operator 
  
    
      
        L
        :
        V
        →
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle L:V\to V}
  with respect to a fixed basis, then it maps each basis vector e into the complement of the span of e, i.e. 
  
    
      
        L
        (
        e
        )
        ∩
        ⟨
        e
        ⟩
        =
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(e)\cap \langle e\rangle =\emptyset }
  where 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        e
        ⟩
        =
        {
        λ
        e
        :
        λ
        ∈
        F
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle e\rangle =\{\lambda e:\lambda \in F\}}
  
Gershgorin circle theorem shows that the moduli of the eigenvalues of A are less or equal to the sum of the moduli of the non-diagonal row entries.


=== Block of zeroes ===
A hollow matrix may be a square n×n matrix with an r×s block of zeroes where  r+s>n.

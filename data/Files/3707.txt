To meet its own requirement for an eight-seat transport the airline's engineering department designed and built the Faucett F-19. The design was based on the Stinson SM-1 Detroiter with improvements to meet the airline's specific operating requirements.

The aircraft was powered by an 875 hp (652 kW) Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engine but the seaplane version use a 600 hp (447 kW) Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engine. Most of the aircraft were built and used by the airline but a number were supplied to the Peruvian Government.

Aspects: {'C. aurea'}

Corydalis (Greek korydal√≠s "crested lark") is a genus of about 470 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the Papaveraceae family, native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere and the high mountains of tropical eastern Africa. They are most diverse in China and the Himalayas, with at least 357 species in China.


== Ecology ==
Corydalis species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species (butterflies), especially the clouded Apollo.


== Toxicity ==
Corydalis cava and some other tuberous species contain the alkaloid bulbocapnine, which is occasionally used in medicine but scientific evidence is lacking in the correct dosages and side effects.Many of the species in Corydalis contain other toxins and alkaloids like canadine, which blocks calcium.

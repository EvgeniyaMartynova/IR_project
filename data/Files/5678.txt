== B-side ==
The B-side of the single "I Care" was "Sneaky Snake," which charted as a tag-along flip side due to airplay.
"Sneaky Snake" is a novelty song about an anthropomorphic snake who likes sneaking up on people and stealing their root beer. After omnisciently observing how Sneaky Snake "goes dancin', wigglin' and a-hissin'/Sneaky Snake goes dancin', gigglin' and a-kissin'," the singer states how he doesn't like him because he laughs, due to moving through the grass and "ticklin' his underneath."

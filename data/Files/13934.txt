Title: D.C. United Academy
Aspects: {'U12'}

The D.C. United Academy is the youth and development program for the Major League Soccer club D.C. United. The program consists of teams at four age levels: the under-23 and under-20 teams, as well as the Academy (U-18/17 & U-16/15) and Pre-Academy teams (U-14, U-13).
The D.C. United Academy has been one of the most successful MLS academies. Many players have been signed directly from the Academy to the professional team, or have later played professionally. Notable players to have graduated from the D.C United Academy include Bill Hamid, who has been called up by the U.S. national team and who was the MLS 2014 Goalkeeper of the Year, and Andy Najar, who has been capped for Honduras and who was the MLS 2010 Rookie of the Year.


== History ==
The D.C. United Academy was created in 2005 in an effort to provide local talent an opportunity to have professional training. D.C. United was one of the first MLS clubs to develop its own academy.
The DC United Academy gained some press in 2013 when DC United Academy graduate Michael Seaton made his league debut with DC United; Seaton was the first player to play an MLS game who was born after MLS began play in 1996. D.C. United decided in 2015, however, to reduce its outlays on its academy in part to help defray the expenses associated with the team's new soccer-specific stadium.


== Structure ==
Like most Major League Soccer teams, United's academy features youth pre-academy teams that ascend to the ranks of the senior team on the professional level. Starting in 2016, United will field their reserve team in the third-division United Soccer League. Beneath their reserve and senior squads is the under-23 side, whom play in the Premier Development League.

The teenage brackets represent the main academy as well as the pre-academy structure. Players from the under-15 to the under-18 age level play in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy league, playing against other academy teams around the nation. Unlike most soccer leagues in the U.S., the USSDA academy league runs on a winter-based schedule, with the season going from August until June.
Consisting of players aged from under-12 to under-14, the Pre-Academy is a stepping stone for younger players to adapt to an academy setting. This age group of players participates in Northeast Pre-Academy League.For players at the U-10 level and below, United offers speciality training camps.
D.C. United, unlike most other MLS team academies, charges fees for its players. Fees are $2,500 per year for the U-14 team, and $1,500 for the U-16 and U-18 teams, although available financial aid reduces these costs. The fees defray costs such as travel, lodging, and uniforms.


== Notable alumni ==
Andy Najar, who transferred from DC United to Belgium's Anderlecht for a reported $2 million, was the first player from the DC United Academy — and first from any MLS academy — to move to Europe on a permanent contract. The youngest DC United Academy signing is Chris Durkin, who signed for DC United in 2016 at 16 years old.
Furthermore, several DC United Academy players have played with U.S. national youth teams.The following list reflects players who have graduated from the D.C. United Academy and subsequently signed a professional contract.

Note: Where a player has played with multiple levels of a national team (e.g., men's team, under-20 team, under-18 team), only the highest level is listed.

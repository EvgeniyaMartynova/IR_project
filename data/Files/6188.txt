Title: I Love the '80s (British TV series)
Aspects: {"I Love the '80s"}

[1]

I Love the '80s is a BBC television mini-series that examines the pop culture of the 1980s. It was commissioned following the success of I Love the '70s and is part of the I Love... series. I Love 1980 premiered on BBC Two on 13 January 2001 and the last, I Love 1989, on 24 March 2001. Unlike with I Love the '70s, episodes were increased to 90 minutes long. The series was followed later in 2001 by I Love the '90s.  The success of the series led to VH1 remaking the show for the US market: I Love the '80s USA, which is known simply as "I Love the '80s" in the US itself. The following  repeat version in 2001 was cut down to an hour per year, then in 2019, the series was repeated again, this time cut down into a 30 minutes per year "highlights" version removing certain pop-culture and/or contributors.


== Contributors ==

== Repeats ==
The series has been repeated a number of times on BBC2, during 2002, 2008 and again 2014.  The series was also repeated on UKTV Documentary, but was edited to fit into one hour slot with adverts. In 2019 BBC2 once again repeated the series but episodes were heavily edited to fit a 30min time slot.


== DVD Release ==
The series has never been released on DVD or other media. As of May 2019, there has still been no release of any of the alternate edits of the series. This is due to the various unavoidable inter-connected Rights and clearances issues between the various music elements, the various Archive rights, intellectual property rights, and programme contributors. This is likely to be why the 2019 repeat version has deleted entire segments where all the various rights could not be cleared. Also, some contributors have since been "disgraced".

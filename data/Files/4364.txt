Stomatella impertusa, common name the strigose stomatella or the elongate false ear shell, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Trochidae, the top snails.


== Description ==
The length of the shell varies between 5 mm and 25 mm. The small, thin shell has a lengthened oval shape. It is shining, yellowish-green, ornamented with white triangular spots with dark apices, sometimes in series. The shell is decussated by incremental and deeper spiral striae. The shell contains three whorls and a nearly terminal apex. The narrow aperture is oval, its ventral face nearly level. Inside it is shining and greenish. The shell is very delicate and slender, allied to Stomatella planulata, a much larger species, and Stomatella auricula,


== Distribution ==
This marine species occurs in the Southwest Pacific, off East India, the Philippines, Australia, Japan, in the Red Sea and as a casual find in the Mediterranean Sea.

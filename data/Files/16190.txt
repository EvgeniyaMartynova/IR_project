Title: Youth Against AIDS
Aspects: {'YAA'}

Youthforce was an international youth network founded in 1999 to raise visibility around the impact of HIV/AIDS on youth.
Youthforce was one of two youth partners who initiated the Youthforce, a self-sustaining international brand and umbrella under which youth from around the world partner with global stakeholders to raise their voice on HIV/AIDS. Each Youthforce creates its own identity and gives space to youth to be heard.
The highlight of Youthforce was an "MTV Ask the Leaders" session featuring former president Bill Clinton, actor Rupert Everett and Peter Piot of UNAIDS. One of the first sessions of its kind, it was broadcast worldwide as part of MTV's Staying Alive Campaign.

Title: F Line (RTD)
Aspects: {'F Line'}

The F Line, part of the light rail system operated by the Regional Transportation District in the Denver metropolitan area in Colorado, was added to the system on November 17, 2006, as part of the Southeast Corridor project (the "T-Rex Project"). It is one of four routes that are part of the RTD's service plan for the corridor. It operates Monday through Friday and does not run on weekends.
According to a map in the RTD's service plan for the corridor, the F Line's color is red.

The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks initiative included the Southeast Corridor extension for the E and F Line, which extended the lines by 2.3 mi (3.70 km) to southern Lone Tree. The extension cost $223 million to construct and was opened on May 17, 2019. It included three new stations, Sky Ridge, Lone Tree City Center, and RidgeGate Parkway, the latter with a 2,000-stall parking facility.

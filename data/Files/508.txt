== Summary ==
The first season, debuting in Canada at April 18, 1997 on the channel Citytv, consisted of four two-hour TV movies (sometimes screened as eight one-hour episodes), alternatively titled Tales from a Parallel Universe. However, some episode guides do not list the two-hour movies as a season but list the subsequent seasons as the first through third.
The second season, debuting in Canada at December 11, 1998 on the channel Space The Imagination Station, consisted of twenty forty-five-minute episodes with an overall story arc concerning an evil scientist called Mantrid who proceeds to convert all matter in the "light" universe (the Light Zone) into one-armed "Mantrid drones".  Mantrid largely succeeds before he is defeated by the Lexx, but not without causing a Big Crunch that results in sending the Lexx through a singularity to an alternate "dark" universe (the Dark Zone).
The third season, debuting in the UK on February 6, 2000 on the British Sci-Fi Channel, comprises 13 episodes in which the Lexx is trapped in orbit around the warring planets Fire and Water, and the crew encounters an enigmatic and cheerful evil being known as Prince, who may be the Devil. The two planets orbit each other at extremely close distance, and share one atmosphere, allowing the inhabitants to pass freely between them.  Fire is the afterlife for all evil souls,  the inhabitants of which are continually engaged in attacks on Planet Water, which is the afterlife of all good souls. Fire is filmed between the dunes of Namibia and the Gothic architecture of Berlin.  The rulers of Fire are Prince and Duke, who both reincarnate whenever it suits them. Water appears to have no ruler, and contains a small population of hedonists on floating islands.
In the fourth and final season of 24 episodes, debuting in the USA on July 13, 2001 on the American Sci-Fi Channel, the Lexx arrives at Earth in the early 21st century, only to find that Prince (now named Isambard Prince, and somehow head of the ATF) and several other old adversaries have arrived there too. Between them, Prince and the Lexx manage to demolish large chunks of the Earth – including the city of Ottawa (a Canadian metonymical in-joke) – before the climactic final episode, televised on April 26, 2002.
Seasons one to three of Lexx were released on VHS and Region 2 DVD in the UK by Contender Limited, although the Season 3 DVDs were initially exclusive to the MVC Entertainment chain of stores and all volumes have since been deleted. Contender failed to obtain the rights to Season 4, which instead went to Momentum Pictures (a subsidiary of Alliance Atlantis), however they haven't released any DVDs. Recently, all four seasons have been released on DVD in multiple regions.

Title: Tyto
Aspects: {'T. alba'}

Tyto is a genus of birds consisting of true barn owls, grass owls and masked owls that collectively make up all the species within the subfamily Tytoninae of the barn owl family, Tytonidae.


== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Throughout their evolutionary history, Tyto owls have shown a better capability to colonize islands than other owls. Several such island forms have become extinct, some long ago, but some in comparatively recent times. A number of insular barn-owls from the Mediterranean and the Caribbean were very large or truly gigantic species.


=== Extant species ===
Seventeen species are recognized:


=== Extinct species ===
Known from ancient fossils
Tyto sanctialbani (Middle - Late Miocene of C Europe) - formerly in Strix, includes T. campiterrae
Tyto robusta (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Gargano Peninsula, Italy)
Tyto gigantea (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Gargano Peninsula, Italy)
Tyto balearica (Late Miocene - Middle Pleistocene of WC Mediterranean)
Tyto mourerchauvireae (Middle Pleistocene of Sicily, Mediterranean)
Tyto jinniushanensis (Pleistocene of Jing Niu Shan, China)
Tyto sp. 1
Tyto sp. 2Late prehistoric extinctions usually known from subfossil remains

Maltese barn owl (Tyto melitensis) found in Malta - formerly in Strix, possibly paleosubspecies of Tyto alba


=== Former species ===
A number of owl fossils were at one time assigned to the present genus, but are nowadays placed elsewhere. While there are clear differences in osteology between true owls and barn-owls, there has been parallel evolution to some degree and thus isolated fossil bones cannot necessarily be assigned to either family without thorough study. Notably, the genus Strix has been misapplied by many early scientists as a "wastebin taxon" for many owls including Tyto.
Tyto antiqua  (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene of Quercy? - Early Miocene of France) was a barn-owl of the prehistoric genus Prosybris; this taxon might be a nomen nudum as the species was originally described in Strix this requires confirmation.
Tyto edwardsi (Late Miocene of Grive-Saint-Alban, France) was a strigid owl but has not yet been reliably identified to genus; it might belong into Strix or the European Ninox-like group.
Tyto ignota (Middle Miocene of Sansan, France) was a strigid owl of unclear affinities; while it might belong into Strix this requires confirmation.
"TMT 164", a distal left tarsometatarsus of a supposed Tyto from the Middle Miocene Grive-Saint-Alban (France) might also belong into Prosybris as it is similar to Tyto antiqua.


== Description ==
They are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although there is considerable variation even amongst species. Tyto owls have a divided, heart-shaped facial disc, and lack the ear-like tufts of feathers found in many other owls. Tyto owls tend to be larger than bay-owls. The name tyto (τυτώ) is onomatopeic Greek for owl.

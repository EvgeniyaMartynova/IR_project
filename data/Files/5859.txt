Title: Tarantula (Riverdales album)
Aspects: {"I Don't Wanna Live Forever (disambiguation)"}

Tarantula is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band the Riverdales. It was released digitally on June 8, 2010 and was released on CD and vinyl on June 22, 2010 through Recess Records. It was the first Riverdales album to be released through Recess, as well as their first album featuring second guitarist Simon Lamb. Ben Weasel has stated that "If [he] had it [his] way, Tarantula would have been part two of a double album with Invasion USA." Tarantula is said to sound more "hardcore" due to the use of two guitars and features hard rock-styled guitar solos. After the album was recorded, Lamb left the band and was replaced by Drew Fredrichsen.

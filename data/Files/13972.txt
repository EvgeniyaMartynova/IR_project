Title: Under-23 sport
Aspects: {'U23'}

Under-23 sport is a competitive age category grouping within sports for athletes under the age of twenty-three. An extension of age categories found in youth sports, the under-23 category is for adults who are still in a developmental stage within their chosen discipline. The intention of the grouping is to allow such adults to improve their skills against opponents of a similar standard, as opposed to elite level of competition found in open senior level competitions, where they may not receive competitive opportunities or may find their development hindered by significant ability differences.The under-23 category roughly corresponds with the age of athletes found competing in college athletics, although in the latter grouping there is a required academic element for student-athletes and typically no upper age limit (in the case of adult learners).The age group somewhat aligns with social definitions used outside of sport, such as the United Nations' definition of youth as "persons between the ages of 15 and 24 years".

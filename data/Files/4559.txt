Title: G postcode area
Aspects: {'G12'}

The G postcode area, also known as the Glasgow postcode area, is a group of postcode districts centred around Glasgow in Scotland.


== Former postal districts and their legacy ==
From 1923 until the introduction of the national postcode system in the late 1960s, Glasgow was divided into (mostly) numbered postal districts for its central and surrounding parts identified by compass-point letters: C1–C5 (corresponding to current postcode districts G1–G5), W1–W5 (G11–G15), NW (G20), N1–N3 (G21–G23), E1–E4 (G31–G34), SE (G40), S1–S6 (G41–G46) and SW1–SW3 (G51–G53).Most of the relatively large districts in the G61-G84 series are wholly outwith Glasgow City; G63 and G83 form a notable projection to cover the banks of Loch Lomond.  Five non-geographic G postcode districts exist as of 2019.

== Airport History ==
The first known photo of the area is from 1953. The 700-acre (280 ha) tract of land that included the airport, which was one of the oldest private airfields in Greater Houston, was owned by descendants of the Andrau family.The airport served general aviation for west Houston, but a Douglas DC-3 and an A-26C Invader are known to have landed there. The airport had two runways, the longest at 4,750 feet, and a seaplane landing and takeoff pond on the east end of the airpark.The airport was closed on December 23, 1998 when a Houston real estate firm paid Andrau Airpark Inc., the airport's owners, 53 million dollars for the land. The tract went under contract to the Camden Property Trust. On December 23, 1998 the new owners of the airport shut its operations. The airport was quickly demolished and the Royal Oaks Country Club subdivision and a golf course replaced the field.

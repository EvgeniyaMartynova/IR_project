Title: Highways in Poland
Aspects: {'S road'}

Highways in Poland are public roads designed to carry large amounts of traffic.
Limited-access highways are part of the national roads network and are divided into motorways and expressways. They feature physical separation of traffic, two-level interchanges with other roads, emergency lanes, feeder lanes, and dedicated roadside rest areas. Motorways differ from expressways in technical parameters, like designated speed, permitted road curvature or minimal distances between interchanges. Moreover, expressways might have single carriageway (as of 2019, about 5% of the highways are single-lane expressways) and might admit a one-level intersection with a minor public road in exceptional cases (in practice, reconstruction of the last such expressway has begun in May 2019).
Except for the single-carriageway expressways, both types of highways generally fulfill the definition of a motorway as characterized by OECD, WRA or Vienna Convention. Speed limits in Poland are 140 km/h on motorways and 120 km/h on dual-carriageway expressways.
As of January 2019, there are 1,645 km (1,022.16 mi) of motorways and 2,152.2 km (1,337.32 mi) of expressways in operation (47% of the intended network), while contracts for construction of further 1,233 km (766.15 mi) of motorways and expressways (15% of the intended network) are ongoing.


== Definitions of highways according to Polish law ==
The 21 March 1985 Public Roads Act, with later amendments, defines the motorways and expressways as follows:

A motorway is a public road with limited access which is designated for motor vehicles only, and features at least two continuous lanes in each direction which are divided by a barrier. They have no one-level interchanges with all the intersecting roads with the land and water transport. They are equipped with roadside rest areas, which are intended only for users on the motorway.Three motorways are intended to span the country: A1 (running from Gdańsk to Czech border), A2 (from German border to Belarusian border) and A4 (from German border to Ukrainian border), with three additional short motorway stretches: A6, A8 and A18. As of 2019, A4 and A8 are completed on the whole intended length. A6 is set to be fully completed by 2020, A1 by 2022, A18 by 2023 and A2 by 2025. Some motorway stretches are tolled, others are free of charge. Motorways are the only roads in Poland which use blue background on road signs - others use green road signs.

An expressway is a public road with limited access which is designated for motor vehicles only, and is marked with one or two continuous divided lanes in each direction. They have no one-level interchanges with the intersecting roads with the land and water transport, intersections with minor public roads being allowed in exceptional cases. They are equipped with roadside rest areas, which are intended only for users on the expressway.Major expressways (over 200 km of intended length) - in various stages of use, construction, or planning - are S3, S5, S7, S11, S17, S19 and S61 running north to south, and S6, S8, S10, S12, S16 and S74, running east to west. Several additional shorter expressways complete the planned network.


== Technical parameters ==
The parameters of these roads are determined by the ministry ordinance of 2 March 1999 (with later amendments). Expressways are different from motorways mainly in that:

Expressways can have a single carriageway. As of 2019, 91% of expressways are dual carriageway, and 9% single carriageway.
Expressways can have narrower lanes (3.5 m vs 3.75 m). Emergency lanes can also be narrower, and in exceptional situations expressways might not have them at all.
Motorways can have interchanges only with main roads and the spacing between interchanges should not be less than 15 km (exceptionally 5 km); or not less than 5 km (exceptionally 3 km) within borders or near a big city or a group of cities. Expressways can have interchanges more often.
In exceptional situations, expressways can admit a one-level junction with minor public roads. As of 2019, the last such expressway in Poland is S3 east of Szczecin.
Expressways are designated for lower speed than the motorways (for example, the road curvature can be higher).
Expressways may be constructed as an upgrade of an existing national road (nonetheless, most modern projects are planned and built as a separate road rather than just as an addition of the lanes to the existing one). Motorways can't be built as an upgrade of a national road but only as a separate road, while the old road must be kept as an alternative.


=== Substandard highways ===
Motorways and expressways constructed before 1999 do not have to fulfill technical parameters listed in the ordinance. There are four notable cases of substandard highways in Poland:

A4 on the section Krzyżowa – Wrocław (103 km (64 mi)) was constructed in years 1934 – 1937 (then the territory of Nazi Germany) and renovated in years 2002 – 2006. The road received new high quality surface but the geometry was kept unchanged and many overpasses above the motorway were kept. In effect, this part has no emergency lanes (which by current standards is only occasionally allowed on expressways and never on motorways) and speed limit is decreased to 110 km/h. A contract for preparing technical documentation for the section's full reconstruction (and widening to three lanes per direction) was signed in 2019.
A6 near Szczecin was constructed by Nazi Germany and while most of it was reconstructed in years 1996 – 1999, a short fragment (5 km (3.11 mi)) still has the original surface from 1930s. Despite very low quality nowadays, this section formally retained an expressways status. Its reconstruction has started in 2017 and will finish in 2020.
A18 (70 km (43 mi)) had its southern carriageway constructed by Nazi Germany. A high quality northern carriageway was constructed in 2006, but southern carriageway still has the original surface made of concrete slabs. Due to very low quality of this carriageway, the route is marked as national road 18 and will only receive a status of A18 after reconstruction scheduled for years 2020 – 2023.
S3 near Szczecin (19 km (12 mi)) was opened in 1979 and has kept its expressway status despite having two at-grade road intersections. Its reconstruction has started in 2019 and will finish in 2021, which will mark the moment when no more expressways with at-grade intersections are left in Poland.


=== Maximum speed allowed on highways ===


== Tolls ==
All expressways are free of payment for vehicles up to 3.5 tons, as are secondary motorways A6, A8 and A18.
Primary motorways A1, A2 and A4 are planned as tolled (some parts are already such). There are two systems of collecting tolls:


=== Open system ===
In this system money is only paid at the toll booths put across the road. Different payment is due according to the type of the vehicle. It is relatively cheap to operate, but it forces drivers to stop at each toll booth, thus lowering the capacity of a motorway. For example, the Greater Poland part of A2 has all of its toll booths spaced approx. 50 km apart.


=== Closed system ===
In this system, there are toll stations on every interchange both entering and exiting the motorway, as well as toll booths on the motorway at the ends of the tolled section. In this case the driver receives a ticket upon entering the motorway and pays at either toll station while exiting the motorway or at the toll booth at the end of the tolled section, with the price dependent on the distance driven. This system is more expensive at building and maintenance, but allows much larger distances between toll booths across the motorway.


=== Tolled sections ===
The following list of tolled sections is valid as of April 2019, and only applies to vehicles up to 3.5 tons. The prices listed apply to passenger cars driving the section's whole length.

Motorway A1:
Tolled: 152 km (94.45 mi) Gdańsk – Toruń (managed by Gdańsk Transport Company, closed system, 30 PLN ($8))

Tolled: 85.2 km (52.94 mi) Poznań – Sługocin (managed by Autostrada Eksploatacja S.A., open system, 40 PLN ($11))
Free: 19 km (11.81 mi) Sługocin – Konin as so-called "buffer zone" between two different systems
Tolled: 103 km (64.00 mi) Konin – Stryków (Łódź) (managed by the state, closed system, 10 PLN ($3))

Free: 153 km (95.07 mi) Zgorzelec – Bielany Wrocławskie,
Tolled: 163 km (101.28 mi) Bielany Wrocławskie – Gliwice-Sośnica (managed by the state, closed system, 16 PLN ($4))
Free: 34 km (21.13 mi) Gliwice-Sośnica – Mysłowice,
Tolled: 52 km (32.31 mi) Mysłowice – Kraków-Balice (managed by Stalexport Autostrada Malopolska S.A., open system, 20 PLN ($5))
Free: 268 km (166.53 mi) Kraków-Balice – Korczowa


=== viaTOLL payment system ===

From 1.07.2011 all vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tons are obliged to have a special viaTOLL apparatus. On the chosen roads (some motorways, expressways and national roads) the special electronic readers are installed. They connect to the apparatus in the vehicle in a wireless way, and they also count the toll the vehicle has to pay. It is possible to buy it on some petrol stations or at the special points of selling. If the apparatus isn't at the place, fines are applied:

1500 PLN if the car is heavier than 12 tons
750 PLN if the car is heavier than 3.5 tons but lighter than 12 tons.


=== Planned Electronical Toll Collection System ===
In 2014 the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development has uncovered the plans to imply the Electronical Toll Collection System. The new plans were made because of the big problems concerning the Manual Toll Collection System. At the time while there is a huge flow of traffic (especially in the holiday period), there are long queues to the toll booths, which, according to some reports, reached up to 10 km. Drivers in these cases are forced to wait 2 hours to pay the toll at the toll booths. That was the reason the works to construct the toll booths on A4 were suspended, even though there were some stages of construction in progress.
The situation wasn't much relieved even after the toll booths had separated a special lane for those vehicles that have been registered into the ViaAuto system. It came out even worse. A lot of experts tell it is one lane less for those paying traditionally.
At those times a few simple solutions were introduced, for example the cashiers themselves giving the tickets. Next solution came from the Council of Ministers, which claimed that the motorway will be free from the day they gave out the decision (06.08.2014) to the end of the summer holidays (it only concerned the period from 4.00 p.m. on Friday to midnight from Sunday to Monday).
Now the ministry is working on the system new electronic system. According to different concepts, there are two options - either the full liquidation of the toll booths or their reconstruction. The reconstructed toll booths had then the toll applied via the viaTOLL system, so every vehicle must have had the viaTOLL apparatus, as the cars and trucks heavier than 3.5 tons have. Taking into account that not every driver drives regularly on the motorway, there must have been an online registration for light cars introduced. After that, when any car would arrive to such a toll booth, the registration plate will be scanned in order to recognise the car. The implication, however, will become true after signing of agreements with private concessionaires first.


== List of Polish motorways and expressways with progress of construction ==
In May 2004, the Council of Ministers of Poland published a document including the planned highway network, the length of which was about 7,200 km (4,474 mi) and contained most of the highways in plans today. More notable among the changes introduced in later amendments include re-routing S8 and adding S61 instead (2009, a change related to the Rospuda Valley conflict), introducing S16 (2015, 2016), S52 (2016) and A50/S50 (2019), as well as extending S5 to Ostróda (2015) and to Bolków (2019), S10 to Wołomin (2015) and S8 to Kłodzko (2019).The following table summarizes the progress of construction of the motorway and expressway network, as of 10th October 2019:


== History ==


=== Before World War II ===
The first plans of creation of a national highway network in Poland were conceived in the interwar period. The main promoter of this concept was Professor Melchior Wladyslaw Nestorowicz of the Warsaw University of Technology, who organized three Road Congresses, during which a group of specialists discussed the creation of the network. On March 5, 1939, in the trade magazine Drogowiec, Professor Nestorowicz proposed a very ambitious plan for the construction of almost 5,000 kilometres of category I and II roads, based on similar programmes in Germany and Italy. Nestorowicz sketched a map of the future system with the following routes:
First class roads would, according to the plans, consist of the following motorways (totalling some 2,500 km (1,553.43 mi):

Warsaw - Łódź - 100 km
Warsaw – Poznań - Polish-German border - 350 km
Warsaw beltway - 130 km
Poznań beltway - 80 km
Gdynia – Bydgoszcz – Łódź – 500 km
Łódź beltway - 90 km
Bytow - Free City of Danzig border - 50 km
Katowice – Kraków – Lwów - 375 km
Warsaw – Lublin - Lwów – Sniatyn - Polish-Romanian border - 550 km
Puławy – Sandomierz – Przemyśl - 175 kmSecond class roads would consist of the following motorways, totalling another 2,295 km (1,430 mi):

Piotrków Trybunalski - Kielce - Sandomierz - 180 km
Warsaw – Kielce – Kraków - 180 km
Łódź - Kalisz - Polish-German border north of Wrocław - 130 km
Warsaw – Grodno – Vilnius – Polish - Lithuania - Latvian border near Daugavpils - 575 km
Grodno - Nowogrodek - Polish-Soviet border near Minsk - 190 km
Bydgoszcz – Poznań – Częstochowa - 350 km
Katowice – Cieszyn – Polish-Czechoslovak border - 60 km
Ostrołęka - Polish-East Prussian border - 50 km
Grodno - Polish-Lithuanian border - 40 km
Grodno - Brzesc nad Bugiem - Krasnystaw - 300 km
Warsaw – Brzesc nad Bugiem - 170 kmBetween 1937 and 1939, a 28 km part between Warlubie and Osiek was built in the time's motorway standard (today not considered as a highway) with a concrete surface, which was designed by Italian engineer Piero Puricelli. This section is now part of voivodeship road 214. The motorway was planned to reach Gdynia, but the outbreak of the Second World War halted the plans.
At the same time, Nazi Germany started the construction of parts of their motorway system, which today form A18 and A4 to Wrocław (Breslau), A6 as the Szczecin bypass (part of the planned motorway to Königsberg) and S22 (also part of the same road to Königsberg). These sections were constructed between 1934 and 1938, about half of them as single-carriageway with the intention of adding a second carriageway later. After 1938, warfare expenses meant little money would be invested into any infrastructure. Only one 9 km single-carriageway piece of what is now A4 motorway west of Gliwice was constructed.


=== After 1945 ===


==== Situation ====
The Potsdam conference defined the new borders for Poland, which were completely different from the 1939 ones. It received the so-called Regained Territories from the former Third Reich with the following parts of motorways (some of them with first carriageway only, some of them destroyed because of the warfare):

"Berlinka" (the road to Königsberg (Kaliningrad)) at the sections between Kołbaskowo and Łęczyca (now A6 and DW142) and between Elbląg and Grzechotki (now S22), in total 106 km
Silezian, between Olszyna and Brzeg (now A18 and A4, ca. 220 km) and the Ujazd-Gliwice-Zabrze part (about 40 km, now DK88)Most of the motorway bridges were destroyed by the armies, but only a few were repaired or rebuilt in the first post-war years. The bridge over Ina river was reconstructed in 1972, and those on S22 only between 1996 and 2003.
Apart from the bridges, almost all the motorways and expressways were left in the same condition as they were in 1945 until the mid-1990s. The only road left from Nazi times that was completed by the People's Republic of Poland (PRP) was a one-carriageway small section between Łęczyca and Lisowo (15 km of what is now DW142) in the powiat stargardzki, which was built on the previous works of Nazis.


==== Plans ====
At the post-war year there were very ambitious plans to make a motorway network for the whole Poland. For example, engineer Eugeniusz Buszma has published his propositions to the network in the magazine "Drogowiec" (1946, issue 1):

East – West (Słubice – Warsaw – Białystok) – 680 km
North – South (Gdynia – Warsaw – Balkans) – 650 km
Silesia – Baltic I (Gdańsk – Łódź – Katowice) – 460 km
Pomeranian (Gdańsk – Szczecin) – 280 km
Silesian (Wrocław – Katowice – Kraków) – 190 km
Mazurian (Kaliningrad – Elbląg – Malbork) – 20 km
Silesia – Baltic II (Bydgoszcz – Wrocław) – 260 km
Łódź – Wrocław – (Prague) – 310 km
Katowice – (Vienna) – 60 km
Poznań – Szczecin – 200 km
Radom – Lublin – (Lviv) – 220 kmIn total, the mileage, according to the proposal, would total more than 3,300 km (2,050 mi).
After the addition of the sections built by the Third Reich the total network length had to be ca. 3700 km. In 1963 the Motorization Council at the Council of Ministers had prezented the similar plan plus the motorways: Warsaw-Kraków-Zakopane, Kraków-Przemyśl, Warsaw-Bydgoszcz-Koszalin, Poznań-Koszalin i Warsaw-Terespol (ca. 1250 km). None of those plans were realized, however.
Despite announcing such pompous plans, no motorway was opened in the meantime.


=== In the 1970s ===

Only in the 1970s did any works start. In 1972 it was planned to build:

the Gliwice-Kraków motorway (now A4)
The second carriageway of the Wrocław-Gliwice motorway (also A4)
the Warsaw-Katowice motorway (so-called "Gierkówka", now the S8/A1 road), in the near futureThe plans were expanded in 1976 by the following sections:

Tarnów – Kraków (now A4),
Eastern GOP (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) bypass (now S1, northern part),
Bielsko-Biała – Cieszyn (now S1, southern part),
Warszawa – Poznań (so-called Olimpijka, now A2),
Łódź – Piotrków Trybunalski (now A1).In 1973 – 1976, "Gierkówka" dual carriageway from Warsaw to Katowice (281 km (175 mi)) was built. Originally planned as a motorway, it was in the end constructed by adding another carriageway to the existing road, hence going through many villages and crossing with local roads. However, the part from Piotrków Trybunalski to Częstochowa (78 km (48 mi)) was constructed on a new route in a semi-motorway standard: road geometry matched this of a motorway and viaducts and overpasses were built for some of the local roads crossing its path, however all the intersections between the highway and the other roads were constructed as one-level with no viaducts or overpasses.


=== In the 1980s ===

In the 1980s the first construction of motorways started.
In 1985 the government already planned to build the expressways apart from the motorways. The only roads left in plans as motorways were A1, A2 and A4. (Additionally, A6 to Rzęśnica and A18 were signed as motorways because they had been built by the motorway standards of the 1930s). The realization of these plans however came at a very slow pace. In the 1980s only the following sections of motorways were put in service: Jaworzno (Byczyna) – Kraków (Balice I) of A4 (35.7 km (22.18 mi)), Września – Konin (Modła), i.e. part of Poznań – Łódź section of A2 (49.2 km (30.57 mi)) and Tuszyn (near Łódź) – Piotrków-Trybunalski of A1 (16.1 km (10.00 mi)).
The roads opened in 1980s were the first motorways and expressways which generally meet the contemporary standards at least with respect to the more important attributes.


=== In the 1990s ===
In the III Republic of Poland the plans started to change again. The following expressways were promoted to motorway standards, temporarily however: A3 on the planned length became S3, and A8 was shortened to the Wrocław bypass instead of the Łódź-Wrocław-Bolków motorway, in 2001, There are some changes that survived, however: the Szczecin bypass(A6) and the Krzywa-Olszyna roads were promoted to motorways at that time, and still are ones. The signage of Krzywa-Olszyna section was A12, however, instead of the A4 at Krzywa-Krzyżowa and A18 at Krzyżowa-Olszyna.

At the end of 1999, only about 276 km (171 mi) of modern dual-carriageway motorways and expressways were present - only 3.5% of the network as planned nowadays, followed by about 90 km (56 mi) of single-carriageway expressways and about 280 km (174 mi) (more than half of them single-carriageway) not-yet-resurfaced Nazi German motorways from 1930s.


=== At the beginning of the new millennium ===


==== Before Poland received the EU membership ====

A few years before Poland entered the EU the tempo of motorway construction increased significantly. The main focus was yet on the east-west motorway A4, although the A2 around Poznań was built, too. Thanks to that by 2005 a direct motorway connection to Kraków from Berlin was established. It was the time when most of the bridges that the World War II destroyed were rebuilt or renovated, especially on A4.
However, the pieces of the motorways couldn't have been yet called a network, as only A4 could have been considered as an intercity highway, as it was in 2004. The rest of the constructed highways were mostly the bypasses of cities. These years a focus to build comfortable and quick connections between major cities started. This is also a period when Poland started introducing motorway tolls, first in 2000 for the A4 section between Mysłowice and Kraków (Balice I).


==== Poland in EU ====

1 May 2004 was a crucial day for the history of motorway construction, and that is when the highway boom started. The main advantage of signing the document is that Poland from the day on request money from the funds in the European Union, so the money could help build, renovate and upgrade the existing road infrastructure(and not only). Under the government of Prime Minister Marek Belka, the Council of Ministers regulations issued in May 2004 detailed plans for a network of motorways and expressways totaling to 7,200 km (4,473.87 mi) across the republic, including 2,033 km (1,260 mi) of designated motorways (A1, A2 (at that times the S2 section was planned as A2), A4, A6, and A18), and the rest being the expressways (S1, S3, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9 (now S19), S10, S11, S12, S14, S17, S22, S51, S69, and S74). S86 existed, but it was not shown in the legal documents until 2015 as part of network. That plan is now the basis of the whole highway network, with only small amendments added in later years.
The current planned network consists of six motorways (A1, A2, A4, A6, A8, A18) and 21 expressways (S1-S3, S5-S8, S10-12, S14, S16, S17, S19, S22, S51-52, S61, S74, S79 and S86).

Title: BMW 1 Series (F52)
Aspects: {'F52'}

The BMW 1 Series (F52) is a subcompact executive sedan made in China, unlike the other variations of the BMW 1 Series, which are manufactured in BMW's Plant Leipzig. This vehicle has been built specifically for the Chinese and Mexican markets by BMW Brilliance, a joint venture between BMW and Brilliance Auto. Unlike other BMW 1 Series cars of the time, it uses the front-wheel drive UKL platform. It was first shown at Auto Guangzhou in 2016, and sales started in China in February 2017. Due to its success in the Chinese market the BMW F52 was later sold in Mexico in 2018. 
However, despite local success of the car, BMW does not have any plans to produce the 1 Series for any other markets, besides what was originally intended. 
The M sport version went on sale in Mexico on 21 October 2019.

Title: Junkers W 34
Aspects: {'W34'}

The Junkers W 34 was a German-built, single-engine, passenger and transport aircraft. Developed in the 1920s, it was taken into service in 1926. The passenger version could take a pilot and five passengers. The aircraft was developed from the Junkers W 33. Further development led to the Junkers Ju 46.


== Development - Historical Background ==
Historical Background:
Junkers W33 Prototype of 1926
The Junkers W33 was a direct modification of the Junkers F13 for cargo operations. The fuselage was lower than that of the F13 as there was no passenger compartment and the initial series did not have any windows in the cargo compartment. For combined cargo/passenger operations these windows were again introduced on later versions of the W33. The cargo loading could be performed through a side door or through a door in the cabin roof. On 17 June 1926 Zimmermann took to the air for the first flight of the Junkers W33 (c/n 794). The prototype was a seaplane version and the first flight was performed on the River Elbe at Leopoldshafen near Dessau. 
A large number of W33 aircraft was ordered from Russia. The parts for these aircraft were built at Dessau and were shipped via Irkutsk to the Dobrolet repair station at Moscow, which performed final assembly from 1928 on. These W33s were used in Russia under the designation PS-3. They were used until 1941 for postal and cargo flights mainly in Siberia. In March 1933 the Dobroljot repair station at Irkutsk started the construction of a modified W33 without the support of Junkers. Until 1935 a total of at least nine of these so-called PS-4s were built at Irkutsk and Moscow. These PS-4 showed several differences to the original W33. Like the initial W33 of 1926, the PS-4 had no windows in the cargo compartment as it was used only as a freighter aircraft in Siberia. 
Junkers W34 of 1926
The first W34 was first flown just a few weeks after the W33 on 7 July 1926 by Zimmermann. Both prototypes appeared nearly identical except for the different engines. Instead of the Junkers L5 inline engine of the W33, the W34 was equipped with a 353kW Gnome et Rhone Jupiter VI radial engine. While future developments of the W33 kept the Junkers engines, the W34 was offered with a wide variety of different air-cooled radial engines, which also influenced the outward appearance, dimensions, and performance of the W34. Also, the cabin roof was a little bit higher as on the W33, making the W34 more capable as a combined cargo and passenger airliner. Finally, the early serial production W34s also showed differences in the tail unit, which was larger than that of the W33. 

Junkers / AFI K43 Prototype of 1930
While the W33/W34 civil aircraft could be built in Germany after the ban on Germany's aviation industry ended in 1926, Junkers was still forced to produce military derivatives of the designs outside of Germany. A military derivative of the W34 was built at A.B. Flygindustri at Limhamn in Sweden under the designator K43. The K43 was fitted with a dorsal machine gun mount at the rear part of the cabin. It could be used as a transport, but also as a light reconnaissance-bomber. At least 18 militarized K43 left Limhamn for Finland (6), Argentina (5), Portugal (5 seaplanes), Bolivia (several) and Chile. An additional 21 W33/W34 were built at Limhamn. Some of these were air ambulances and transports for military purposes. One W33g was sold to the Swedish Air Force in 1933 and designated as Trp 2. It was used until 1935 as an ambulance aircraft in Sweden. Two further W34h were used by the Swedish Air Force as Trp 2A between 1933 and 1945 for the same purpose.

W33/W34s were used for a wide area of utility purposes, i.e. as transport, reconnaissance or bomber aircraft, but also as ambulance and pest control aircraft. They were used by civil operators on all five continents. The Dessau W33 production line was stopped during 1932. At Limhamn some K43s were still built in 1933 when production was stopped there. The last W33s were built in Russia during late 1934 / early 1935. In 1933 Luftwaffe again ordered a larger number of W34s, which were delivered until 1935; mainly for training purposes, especially as navigator and W/T operator training. Some of these aircraft were later used during the Spanish Civil War by the Condor Legion. After the end of WWII, most W33/W34 were retired. The last W34 was a Canadian W34, which went out of service in 1961. 
One Junkers W 34 be/b3e managed to break the then-current altitude record on 26 May 1929 when it reached 12,739 meters (41,795 feet). That aircraft carried the markings D-1119 and it was equipped with a Bristol Jupiter VII engine. The airplane was flown by Willi Neuenhofen.

The Junkers W 34 was manufactured in many different versions. The total production numbers for the civil market were around 1,000, a further 2,024 his and haus were built under license for the RLM and Luftwaffe. The unit price was between RM 65,000 and 70,400.
On 31 January 1944 the Luftwaffe still had 618 W 34hi's and 516 W 34haus in service: the majority were used by flight schools; mainly as navigator and radio operator training (3 or 4 navigator or radio-operator trainees).
The Junkers K.43, nicknamed the "Bush Bomber", was used extensively during the Chaco War (1932–1935) fought between Bolivia and Paraguay. See external links.
The Colombian Air Force used the W 34 and K-43 in the Colombia-Peru War in 1932–3.The Swedish Air Force operated three W 33/34 between 1933 and 1953 in the transport and air ambulance roles, initially with the military designation Trp 2 and Trp 2A, eventually changed to Tp 2 and Tp 2A. One of these is preserved today in civilian colors as SE-BYA.

Title: BMW N47
Aspects: {'N47'}

BMW N47 is a four-cylinder common rail diesel engine that has many improvements over its predecessor, the M47. In 2014 it was replaced with the B47.


== First use ==
The N47 engine debuted in March 2007 in the facelifted 1 Series BMW E87 and E81 and was available in the 1 Series BMW E82 and E88, which were introduced later in the same year.


== Usage in other models ==
The engine also became available in the 5 Series BMW E60 and E61 from September 2007, several months after the 5 series was face lifted, during which time the older M47 remained available.
In the 2008 model year 3 Series E90/E91/E92/E93 when the entire 3 series range gained the company's Efficient Dynamics technology. 
Not long after it became available in the X3 and has since then become available in the X1.
The N47 comes as a 1.6 L; 97.5 cu in (1,598 cc) (D16) and 2.0 L; 121.7 cu in (1,995 cc) (D20) unit, the latter identical in capacity to the BMW M47TU/TU2 series.

=== 163 bhp (122 kW; 165 PS) version ===
A new 163 bhp (122 kW; 165 PS) 360 N⋅m (266 lb⋅ft) derivative was introduced in September 2009 for the 2010 model year.
This version featured exceptionally low CO2 emissions of only 109 g/km (6.2 oz/mi) and fuel consumption of 68.9 mpgThis version was used in the E90 BMW 320d Efficient Dynamics


=== 181 bhp (135 kW; 184 PS) version ===
The "standard" x20d model has extra 14 bhp (10 kW; 14 PS), at 177 bhp (132 kW; 179 PS) but 7 lb⋅ft (9 N⋅m) of torque less at 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft). This is found in the

E81/E82/E87/E88 120d
E90/E91/E92/E93 320d
5 Series E60 and E61 520d
E84 X1 X1 sDrive20d, X1 xDrive20d and E83 X3 xDrive20d.
2014–2015 F22 220dIn Europe, this particular version is one of the most popular engines in the entire range; the best selling 3 series is the 320d, while the 520d is the UK's best selling 5 series.The updated version of this engine introduced in March 2010 produces 135 kW (184 PS; 181 hp) at 4000 rpm and 380 N⋅m (280 lb⋅ft) at 1750-2750 rpm.


=== Twin turbo version ===
In October 2007, BMW introduced a twin sequential turbo model. With 204 bhp (152 kW; 207 PS), it is the first production diesel on sale to achieve a specific output of over 100 bhp (75 kW; 101 PS) per liter. It uses the same turbo technology first shown in the E60 535d.
The 141 bhp (105 kW; 143 PS) model was used in the

E87 123d
E84 X1 xDrive 23d
2014–2015 F22 225d


== Variants ==


== Timing chain problems ==
The N47 engine family is prone to excessive timing chain wear and premature failure. Rattling noise from the rear of the engine is indicative of the condition. Timing chain failure may call for engine replacement or a costly repair. The most seriously affected units which require the most extensive repairs were produced from 01.03.2007 to 05.01.2009. However there have been frequent reports of timing chain failure in 1, 3 and 5 series BMW engines manufactured from as early as 2004 until at least 2011 in both the petrol and diesel versions (and hence not just necessarily in the N47 engine). At times the failure has resulted in a dangerous cut out of the engine while the vehicle was being driven - sometimes at relatively high speed. A “Quality Enhancement” was issued by BMW for some, but not all vehicles, but has since been discontinued.


== Other issues ==
The return spring on the turbo's wastegate was not originally lubricated or covered, this frequently resulted in early failure causing the waste-gate to remain partially or fully open. With the subsequent loss in compression, fuel consumption increased by 30%-50%. The problem was described by BMW engineers as a "known fault" and was immediately repaired (BMW mobile engineers even carried boxes of an improved spring), however BMW refused to compensate customers for the excessive fuel consumption and denied this fault was their liability.
As the cars equipped with this engine are coming of age, some hoses in the engine bay can start to break down. This is not to be ignored, even though this does not illuminate the CEL, it just sets a code in the ECU. If the vacuum hose supplying the EGR cooler bypass valve gets a hole rubbed in it, or breaks down from old age and oil spray, the EGR cooler won't get bypassed during the engine warmup period. This causes excessive buildup in the cooler matrix, and when the engine warms up these solid chunks of buildup can detach from the EGR cooler and get sucked into the plastic intake tube, melting holes in the intake tube, causing a massive boost leak and in very rare cases an engine fire.

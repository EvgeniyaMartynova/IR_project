== Selection process ==


=== Auditions ===
The producers' auditions began on September 29, 2012 at the State University of Medan in Medan, North Sumatra. More producers' auditions were held on October 3 at the Sasana Budaya Ganesha in Bandung, West Java, October 23 at the Balai Prajurit in Surabaya, East Java, November 6 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta, Special Region of Yogyakarta and concluded on November 13–14 at the Jakarta International Expo in Jakarta, Jakarta Special Capital Region.On October 22, 2012, RCTI announced that applicants could upload a video of them singing onto X Factor Indonesia website and it was opened for 5 days only (October 24–28). Selected applicants would appear in front of the judges.
The last set of auditions took place during November 22, 25-28, and December 1–4, 2012 at Studio 8 RCTI. These auditions individually occur simultaneously before both the judges and a live studio audience; and with such audience in attendance able to applaud/cheer approval or disapproval and perhaps influencing the judges.


=== Bootcamp ===
Filming for bootcamp was held on December 18–20, 2012 in Studio 8 RCTI. As with the auditions, there was no sign of Anggun at bootcamp. The bootcamp stage was broadcast in two episodes on January 25 and February 1. The first day of bootcamp saw judges split the 119 acts into their four categories: Boys, Girls, Over-24s and Groups. They received vocal coaching and each category later performed one song: the Boys sang "Harus Terpisah" or "Hargai Aku", the Girls sang "Butiran Debu" or "Rindu", the Over-24s sang "Separuh Aku" or "Bunga Terakhir" and the Groups sang "Could It Be" or "Tak Pernah Padam". At the end of the day, the number of acts was cut to 72. On the second day, acts were given dance lessons by choreographers. The judges then split the number of acts down to two groups, 22 acts through to the next day, and remaining 50 acts must perform once again, with an a cappella performance.
The judges then went on to cut 24 acts. The 48 remaining acts were then given the task of learning one song, making it their own and performing it in front of judges. The judges then chose the final 24 acts, based on these performances. However, they finally chose 26 acts. At the end of the day, judges suggested that the Over 24s category be changed to 26 and Over, as the quality of older singers was high. The Boys and Girls categories then comprised singers aged 15 to 25, rather than 15 to 23. As the groups category was the weakest, four rejected soloists from the Boys category and four from the Girls category were asked to form two groups, as a Girlband, Ilusia Girls and a Boyband, Nu Dimension.
The 26 successful acts were:

Boys:  Adhi Permana, Dicky Adam, Dennis Martha, Gede Bagus, Mikha Angelo, Steven Fasly
Girls: Yohanna Febrianti, Shena Malsiana, Fatin Shidqia, Theresia Dina, Pratami Marja Jeliana, Melissa Putri, Nurul Fadhila
Over 26s: Agus Hafiluddin, Alex Rudiart, Novita Dewi, Syarifah Raykhan, Isa Raja, Taufik Hidayat, Lisa Sulistyowati, Dwi Soraya
Groups: Dalagita, Awan, Jad n Sugy, Nu Dimension, Ilusia Girls


=== Judges' home visit ===
The judges' home visit was the last stage of the selection process. The episode was aired on February 8. This was the debut episode for Anggun as judge and mentor on the show. During this stage, it was revealed that Dhani would mentor the Groups, Rossa would mentor the Girls, Anggun would mentor the Boys, and Bebi would mentor the Over-26s. The final selection process was aided by an assistant per category. Kevin Aprilio joined Dhani at Marina Batavia in Jakarta, Maia Estianty joined Rossa at her private-house in Jakarta, personnel of KLa Project, Lilo joined Anggun at Ubud in Bali, and Sandhy Sondoro joined Bebi at Eco Park in Ancol, Jakarta. At judges' home visit each act performed a song they personally picked and performed it in front of their mentor and his/her assistant.


=== Showcase and wildcard ===
Showcase is the first live performance for the 12 acts who made it through to the Gala live show. Each mentor will introduce the acts who best they have to the public. Each act will perform one at a time to show their skills. At the beginning of showcase, it was announced that each judge could bring back one further act back as a wildcard. The public then voted for which of the four wildcards would become the thirteenth finalist. This left one judge with an extra act.

=== Ratings ===


=== Controversy ===
In week six of gala show, Ahmad Dhani and Rossa opted to send home Alex Rudiart in favor of Gede Bagus, causing the elimination of Alex Rudiart. This decision resulted in large amount of criticisms and outrages from the public, who claimed the decision as unfair. As a result, a lot of social media reactions begin to appear including several motion to boycott the show.However, the Boikot group had little to no effect on the immense success of the first season and the hype (and ratings) continued to build cementing X Factor as a phenemenon in Indonesian TV history. The Boikot group was disbanded as a result of its inability to have any success.

Title: Vector W2
Aspects: {'W2'}

The Vector W2 was a fully functional concept car intended for production constructed by Vector Motors in 1978. It had a Bosch fuel injected twin-turbocharged 350 cid (5.7 L) aluminum Chevrolet V8 engine that produced over 600 hp (450 kW) and over 600 ft·lbf (800 N·m) of torque. The top speed was a claimed 242 mph (389 km/h).The name comes from the "W" for Jerry Wiegert (designer and founder of Vector Motors) and "2" for the number of turbochargers. Over the time prior to production the car went through a number of improvements in performance, technology, updated styling exercises, as well as color changes reflecting an ever-evolving cutting edge design ready to take its place as America's answer to the 'Supercar Elite'. The car was displayed at international auto shows worldwide, featured in and photographed by many automotive publications and was very well received. Between 1978 and 1987, Wiegert attempted to raise the money to start series of the car. In its lifetime, the car covered over 100,000 mi (160,934 km) in testing, more than any other concept car. In 1989, the final version of the W2 went into production as the Vector W8.
Currently, the Vector W2 prototype is owned by Wiegert. The car is currently dismantled, and stored alongside other Vector equipment at the current Vector headquarters in Wilmington, California.

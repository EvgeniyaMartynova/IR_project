Title: Logitech G19
Aspects: {'G19'}

The Logitech G19 was a keyboard produced by Logitech designed specifically for gamers. It included 12 macro keys that could each have 3 macros assigned to them. It included an upgraded color LCD screen with a higher resolution in comparison to the screen from its earlier model, the Logitech G15 and the newer keyboard Logitech G510. Another notable difference of the G19 when compared to previous G15 and G510 models is that it required a separate power source; as such it came packaged with an AC power supply.

Many different games have native support for the G19. For these games, information such as ammunition, health and items the player is currently holding can be displayed on the LCD panel. Some games and programs require patches to allow the G19 to be used with them. It's worth noting that the G19 will run all plugins created for the G15/G13, although in black-and-white only.

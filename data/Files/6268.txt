Title: Caudron J Marine
Aspects: {'J type'}

The Caudron J Marine was an amphibious, two-seat, biplane equipped with floats and wheels, simiar to the earlier Caudron J floatplane.
The Caudron J was essentially a seaplane version of the two-seat Caudron G and single-seat Caudron F. The F, G and J all followed a similar layout with 2½ bay biplane wings, a tail-unit, with single fin and rudder, supported on struts attached to the wings at the first inter-plane struts and a central fuselage nacelle housing the cockpit and mounting the tractor engine. Two main floats were strut-supported under the wings and a small tail-float attached to the tail-unit. Power was supplied by a 100 hp (75 kW) Anzani 10-cylinder radial engine.The three production Caudron J Marine were used by the French Navy (la Marine Française) for reconnaissance and artillery observation. On 8 May 1914, René Caudron flew the second example from a wooden platform erected over a gun turret, on the French Navy cruiser Foudre. The first example was powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome 9 Delta rotary engine, with the remaining two powered by 80 hp (60 kW) Gnome 7 Lambda rotary engines.

Title: African hoopoe
Aspects: {'U. africana'}

The African hoopoe (Upupa africana) is a species of hoopoe in the family Upupidae. Previously considered as a subspecies (Upupa epops africana) of the hoopoe, due to its vocalisations and small differences in plumage, but it is otherwise similar to the other species.
The species was described by the German naturalist Johann Matth√§us Bechstein under the current binomial name  Upupa africana.


== Description ==
The African hoopoe is 25-28 centimeters (10-11 inches) in length and weighs 40-60 grams (1.4-2.1 ounces). It has a long, decurved bill, with cinnamon, black and white plumage and a long crest that raises when the bird is alarmed. Its wings are broad and rounded. The female is slightly duller than the male with less white in the secondary feathers. The juvenile has dull buff underparts with a shorter bill and buff tinge to the white wing bars.


=== Voice ===
"Hoop-oop" or "Hoop-oop-oop", typically with all notes at the same pitch.


== Distribution and ecology ==
The African hoopoe can be found in South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Saudi Arabia and the southern half of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It inhabits broadleaf forests and savannah. It feeds on insects and their larvae, foraging by inserting its beak into the ground.

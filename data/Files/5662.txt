Live Report represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1989 with the song  "Why Do I Always Get It Wrong?", which placed 2nd in Lausanne, Switzerland.


== National final ==
A Song for Europe was a television show presented on 24 March 1989 from Studio 6, at Television Centre, London, featuring eight songs and hosted by Terry Wogan on BBC1. A separate results show was broadcast on BBC1 the same evening. BBC Radio 2 simulcast the final and also broadcast the results show, both with commentary by Ken Bruce.
The eight songs in contention to represent the United Kingdom were premiered in various programmes on BBC Radio 2 between 20 and 23 March.
The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all but the winning song, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set. Hazlehurst conducted two live keyboard players who accompanied the UK entryâ€™s backing track at the Eurovision final in Lausanne.
For the second year running, the BBC convened a panel to pass comment on each of the songs. The panel comprised Deke Arlon, Gary Davies, Leslie Bricusse, and former Eurovision winner Lulu.


=== The songs ===
This was a very dis-jointed final. The original singer chosen for "Back in the Groove" was to have been Garry Gibb; the song "Shame" was to have been sung by its writer, Marwenna Haver, and the song that won had its name and the name of the performer changed.
This was the third appearance in a UK final for James Oliver. This year he had a sad ballad which was, at times, drowned-out by his four backing singers. James' microphone also broke down, as it had also done four years earlier in the UK final.
Danny Ellis had the pedigree writing team on paper but gave the appearance during his performance that he had one too many sips of the fizzy pop prior to his performance. DJ Gary Davies said that he could imagine it being sung by Frank Sinatra. Danny had previously written "Where does that love come from" performed by the Duskey Sisters at the 1981 Irish National final for Eurovision placing joint 3rd.
Julie Coulson aka Julie C had put out her song on 7" single with a sticker on the front cover saying: "Too good for Eurovision"
The Pearls were Emma Robbins (sister to Kate Robbins and Jane Robbins), Sophie Allisstone, Beejay Baddon, and Pamela Sheyne (also known as Pam Sheyne). Their song was actually written by husband and wife writing team Joe and Pauly Ortiz. Pam Sheyne would later appear at the UK finals of 1994 and 1996. The Robbins sisters (Kate and Jane) had themselves been in the UK final of 1980 as part of the group Prima Donna
Frankie Johnson, 27 from Wales; had previously been the British Doubles Dance Champion at the age of 18 and was in the Top of the Pops dance troupe Zoo He also used to sing in his dad's group The Shantels. Frankie's first group were called Whisper Zone who were an 8 piece. As part of the dance group Harlem  he had won the "Saturday Super Store" talent show. His first ever single on Debut Records was called "Call Me" and was a minor success in the UK Soul Charts.
Linda Carroll was making her second appearance in a UK final.

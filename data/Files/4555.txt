Title: BMW 7 Series
Aspects: {'G11'}

The BMW 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan produced by the German automaker BMW since 1977. It is the successor to the BMW E3 "New Six" sedan and is currently in its sixth generation.
The 7 Series is BMW's flagship car and is only available in a saloon bodystyle (including long wheelbase and limousine models). It traditionally introduces technologies and exterior design themes before they trickle down to other models in BMW's lineup.The first generation of the 7 Series was powered by straight-6 petrol engines, and following generations have been powered by inline-4, straight-6, V8 and V12 engines with both natural aspiration and turbocharging. Since 1995, diesel engines have been optional in the 7 Series. 
Unlike the 3 Series and 5 Series saloons, BMW has not produced a M model for the 7 Series (i.e. an "M7"). However, in 2014 an "M Performance" option became available for the 7 Series.

The E23 is the first generation 7 Series, and was produced from 1977 to 1987. It was built in a 4-door sedan body style with 6-cylinder engines, to replace the E3 sedans. From 1983 to 1986, a turbocharged 6-cylinder engine was available.
The E23 introduced many electronic features for the first time in a BMW, including an on-board computer, service interval indicator, a "check control panel" (warning lights to indicate system faults to the driver), a dictaphone and complex climate control systems. It was also the first BMW to offer an anti-lock braking system (ABS), a driver's airbag and double-link front suspension.


== Second generation (E32; 1986–1994) ==

The E32 is the second generation of 7 Series, which was produced from 1986 to 1994. It was initially available with a straight-six or V12 engine. In 1992, V8 engines became available.

The E32 750i was the first car adhering to BMW's self-imposed speed limit of 250 km/h (155 mph). The 'iL' models were the first time that a long-wheelbase option was offered by BMW.


== Third generation (E38; 1994–2001) ==

The E38 is the third generation of the 7 Series, which was produced from 1994 to 2001. The model range consisted of standard length and long wheelbase ("iL" models) sedans.

The 760i model was the world's first production V12 engine to use direct injection.

The F01/F02/F03/F04 is the fifth-generation 7 Series, which was produced from 2008 to 2015. The model range consisted of standard length and long wheelbase ("Li" models) sedans.

== Sixth generation (G11/G12; 2015–present) ==

The G11/G12 is the sixth generation of 7 Series, which has been in production since 2015. It was revealed on June 10, 2015 at BMW's headquarters in Munich. An official public reveal took place at the 2015 International Motor Show Germany.
G11 is the codename for the short-wheelbase model, the extended wheelbase model is codenamed G12 and designated with an additional L letter. 
The G11/G12 is the first car lineup of BMW Group to be based on the modular OKL platform (Oberklasse, German for luxury class). The OKL platform adopts technology first introduced in BMW i models, namely the introduction of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer as structural chassis components.
As part of BMW's strategy of introducing plug-in hybrid variants for all future car models, both, the short and long-wheelbase models will be available with hybrid powertrains under the designations 740e and 740Le in 2016.

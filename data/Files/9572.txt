Title: Obruchevichthys
Aspects: {'O. gracilis'}

Obruchevichthys is an extinct genus of tetrapod from Latvia during the Late Devonian. When the jawbone, the only known fossil of this creature, was uncovered in Latvia, it was mistaken as a lobe-fin fish. However, when it was analyzed, it proved to hold many similarities to Elginerpeton, from Scotland. It was then declared belonging to the earliest group of tetrapods.

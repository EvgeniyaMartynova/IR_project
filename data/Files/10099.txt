Title: List of New Testament papyri
Aspects: {'P (disambiguation)'}

A New Testament papyrus is a copy of a portion of the New Testament made on papyrus. To date, over 130 such papyri are known. In general, they are considered the earliest witnesses to the original text of the New Testament.This elite status among New Testament manuscripts only began in the 20th century. The grouping was first introduced by Caspar René Gregory, who assigned papyri texts the Blackletter character

    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}}
   followed by a superscript number. This number refers not to the age of the papyrus, but to the order in which it was registered. Before 1900, only 9 papyri manuscripts were known, and only one had been cited in a critical apparatus (

  11 by Constantin von Tischendorf). These 9 papyri were just single fragments, except for

    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}}
  15, which consisted of a single whole leaf. The discoveries of the twentieth century brought about the earliest known New Testament manuscript fragments. Kenyon in 1912 knew 14 papyri, Aland in his first edition of Kurzgefasste... in 1963 enumerated 76 papyri, in 1989 were known 96 papyri, and in 2008 124 papyri. As of 2019, a total of 140 papyri are known.
Among the most important are the Chester Beatty Papyri:

    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}}
  47, which contains the Book of Revelation. All of these date from sometime in the third century.Also significant are the Bodmer Papyri:

    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}}
  75, which contains the Gospels of Luke and John. These early manuscripts are more complete, allowing scholars to better examine their textual character.Not all of the manuscripts are simply New Testament texts:

The P-numbers are the standard system of Gregory-Aland.
Dates are estimated to the year range shown.
Content is given to the nearest chapter; verses are sometimes listed. Thus, many of the papyri are small fragments, not whole chapters. For instance, 
  
    
      
        
          
            P

== Distribution based on content ==
Note: "Early" manuscripts are manuscripts dated firmly from the fourth century or earlier. Roughly half of the papyri are "early". Some manuscripts contain content from more than one New Testament book, so the numbers above do not directly correspond to the total number of manuscripts.

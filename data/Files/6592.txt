Title: GS&WR Class 201
Aspects: {'J11'}

The Great Southern and Western Railway Class 201 was a class of ten 0-6-0 side tank locomotives designed by Locomotive Engineer, H. A. Ivatt in 1887 for shunting heavy goods trains at Kingsbridge and Cork yards.  Although the design is generally attributed to Ivatt they were actually created in the last year of Alexander McDonnell's tenure.


== Design ==
The decision to proceed with an 0-6-0T design was discussed between Ivatt and Aspinall due to issues with preceding 0-6-4T locomotives.  Ivatt's design incorporated the same cylinders, coupled-wheels and boilers as the 0-6-4T's.


== Service ==
Constraints on the locomotive design meant that the coupled wheelbase had to be as short as possible to negotiate the curves in the dock areas but the locomotive had to have sufficient power available for the increasing load of the trains.Under the system employed by the Great Southern Railways they became Class J11. All of the class survived until 1949, with No. 217 being withdrawn in 1961 and No. 201 withdrawn in 1963.

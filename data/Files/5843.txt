== Critical reception ==
Damien Scott from Complex felt that the song could've blended in well on Aaliyah's second studio album One in a Million. According to Scott "I Don't Wanna" was a sullen record that would have fit perfectly on One in a Million, thanks to its somber keys, halted delivery, and abrasive honesty." He also felt that it made for the perfect song for someone going through a break up. Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters praised the song saying , "I Don't Wanna" showcases an ode to rekindling love, often in a near-double time delivery, something like Usher's "Confessions, Part II" or Mariah Carey's "We Belong Together".

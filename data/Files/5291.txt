Title: Heathkit H11
Aspects: {'H11'}

The Heathkit H11 Computer was an early kit-format personal computer introduced in 1978. It was essentially a Digital Equipment PDP-11 in a small-form-factor case, designed by Heathkit. The H11 was one of the first 16-bit personal computers, at a list price of US$1,295, but was too expensive for most Heathkit customers and was discontinued in 1982.


== Specifications ==
The H11 featured:
Processor — LSI-11 (KD11-HA half-size or "double-height" card)
Speed            — 2.5 MHz
ROM              — 8Kwords (16 Kbytes) (max)
RAM              — 32Kwords (64 Kbytes) (max)
Slots            — 7 Q-bus slots
Storage          — H27 8-inch floppy drive  (2 256k 8-inch single sided drives) or paper tape
I/O              — serial (RS-232) or parallel ports
Operating system — HT-11 (a simplified version of RT-11)
Instruction set  — PDP-11/40 instruction set
Languages        — BASIC, Focal and othersInitial memory limitations restricted the selection of software the system could handle, but the system could be expanded to 32KW x 16-bit RAM. Many PDP-11 operating systems and programs ran without trouble. The system would also work with most DEC PDP-11 equipment, including many Q-bus compatible peripherals.

Title: Xamtanga language
Aspects: {'Xamir'}

Xamtanga (also Agawinya, Khamtanga, Simt'anga, Xamir, Xamta) is a Central Cushitic language spoken in Ethiopia by the Xamir people.


== Sound system ==


=== Vowels ===
The central vowels /ɨ ə a/ have fronted and backed allophones, depending on the adjacent consonant(s).


=== Consonants ===
/h/ is found only word-initial in loanwords, and may be glottal [h] or pharyngeal [ħ].
/t/ is alveolar before the vowel /i/, dental otherwise.
/q/ can be ejective [qʼ], and in some cases the ejectives appear to be in free variation with the voiceless plosives.


=== Phonological processes ===


==== Gemination ====
In positions other than word-initial, Xamtanga contrasts geminate and non-geminate consonants. With most consonants, the difference between a geminate and a non-geminate is simply one of length, but the cases of /b t q/ are more complex.  When not word-initial, non-geminate /b/ is realized as a bilabial [β] or labiodental fricative [v], and /t/ and /q/ are realized as affricates: [tθ qχ]. Their geminate equivalents may be realized as prolonged [bː tː qː], or can simply be short [b t q].
In word-initial position, geminate consonants do not occur, and /b t q/ are realized as plosives.

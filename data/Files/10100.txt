Title: List of glossing abbreviations
Aspects: {'P (disambiguation)'}

This page lists common abbreviations for grammatical terms that are used in linguistic interlinear glossing.
Abbreviations beginning with N- (a common prefix for non-) or ending with -Z (a common suffix for -izer) may not be listed separately. For example, NPST non-past and TRZ transitivizer are not listed below, as they are composable from N- non- + PST past and TR transitive + -Z -izer.
Abbreviations are generally written in all caps or—apart from the terms A, S, O and P—in small caps, to distinguish them from lexical words.

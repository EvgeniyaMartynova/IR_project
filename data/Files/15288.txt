Title: The Wackiest Ship in the Army (TV series)
Aspects: {'The Wackiest Ship in the Army'}

The Wackiest Ship in the Army is an American comedy-adventure series that aired for one season on NBC between September 19, 1965, and April 17, 1966. Produced by Harry Ackerman and Herbert Hirschman, the series is loosely based on the 1960 film starring Jack Lemmon and Ricky Nelson. Although often referred to as a comedy series, the show violated three unwritten rules which unofficially defined TV sitcoms at the time: it was an hour in length (almost all comedy series were only a half-hour, and the few attempts at hour sitcoms were unsuccessful), it had no laugh track, and characters were sometimes killed in it.


== Synopsis ==
The series is set in the Pacific theater of World War II and centers about the crew of the USS Kiwi, a leaky wooden twin-masted schooner whose mission was to place spies behind Japanese lines.  It achieved this by (apart from the ship's non-combatant appearance) sailing under false colours (it would fly the Swiss flag) whenever it entered enemy waters. The Kiwi was jointly commanded by Army Major Simon Butcher (Jack Warden) who was in charge of shore operations and Navy Lieutenant, junior grade Richard "Rip" Riddle (Gary Collins) who was in charge afloat. The crew consisted of:

Mike Kellin: CPO Willie Miller (also in the 1960 film, and listed in the series opening credits)
Mark Slade: Radioman Patrick Hollis
Fred Smoot: Machinist Mate Seymour Trivers
Rudy Solari: Gunner's Mate Sherman Nagurski
Don Penny: Pharmacist Mate Charles Tyler, ship's cook


== Notable guest stars ==

=== Ship ===
The USS Kiwi was based on the real-life USS Echo, a 40-year-old schooner or scow that was transferred to the United States Navy from the government of New Zealand. It was returned to New Zealand in 1944.


== In other media ==
A paperback based on the series, by Lee Bergman, was released in 1965.

Title: I Don't Mind (James Brown song)
Aspects: {"I Don't Mind"}

"I Don't Mind" is a rhythm and blues song written by James Brown and performed by Brown and the Famous Flames. Its unusual chord progression – in Brown's words, it "opens with a 13, goes down to a C9, then goes to a G7 and to the A7" – prompted objections during the recording session from producer Gene Redd, who considered it musically "wrong". Released as a single in 1961, it reached number four in the R&B Billboard charts and number 47 in the Pop Billboard charts. Brown and the Flames also performed it on their 1963 album Live at the Apollo.

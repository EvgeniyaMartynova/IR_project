I Can See Your Voice, also known as ICSYV (Korean: 너의 목소리가 보여; RR: Neo-eui Moksori-ga Bo-yeo; MR: Nŏŭi Moksorika Poyŏ) is a television music game show that originally aired on Mnet and its simulcast on tvN Korea. The South Korean program was a success and subsequently became an international franchise as I Can See Your Voice.


== Gameplay ==
The guest artist(s) must attempt to guess six contestants who are 'good singers' (skilled vocalists) and who are 'bad singers' (tone-deaf vocalists) without hearing them singing. They also help with a group of panelists under the Tone-deaf Detective Team (also called SING-vestigators).
After they eliminate one to two contestants in each round, they reveal their singing ability on the Stage of Truth. For the groups, all members must be able to sing to be considered 'good singers'. If one member of the group can't sing well, even while the others can sing, they're all considered 'bad singers'. The last person standing will get to sing alongside the guest artist(s).
If the winner is a 'good singer', they will get a chance to release the song alongside the guest artist(s) as a digital single. If the winner is a 'bad singer', they receive ₩5,000,000 ($4,500). On the 5th season's first episode, the winning skilled vocalist received a pair of specially-made microphones.


== Round and clues ==
There are six individual or groups standing on a platform referred to as "SEE-cret songers", with their own aliases to make them keep secret. They do not speak until the final reveal.Several format gameplay changes occurred during the show's existence in 2016. The number of "SEE-cret songers" originally were eight or nine in the first three episodes of the 1st season, then reduced to seven until the 3rd season, and again to six starting from the 4th season.

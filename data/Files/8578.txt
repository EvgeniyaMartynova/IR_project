Title: Category:Disambiguation pages
Aspects: {'M. Monsur Ali Medical College'}

Disambiguation in Wikipedia is the process of resolving the conflicts that occur when articles about two or more different topics could have the same "natural" page title. This category contains disambiguation pages:  non-article pages containing links to other Wikipedia articles and disambiguation pages.
Disambiguation pages are added to Category:Disambiguation pages by placing the {{Disambiguation}} template on the page itself. Other templates are available that place articles in more specific disambiguation subcategories. A page may also be assessed as "disambiguation-class" by various WikiProjects by including "|class=Disambig" in a WikiProject template on the talk page of the disambiguation page. This places the talk page in a subcategory of Category:Disambig-Class articles.


== Notes ==
Do not add articles to these sub-categories or create additional sub-categories until you read Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)â€”most of the sub-categories do not comply with the MOS and will be removed.
Links to disambiguation pages other than from the top of articles are usually mistakes. Find and fix them at disambiguation pages with links.Lists of disambiguation pages:

== History ==


=== 15th century ===
Jablonec was first documented in 1492. At that time Jablonec was a village.  


=== 16th to 19th centuries ===
Under the Thirty Years' War, Jablonec was a small non-agricultural village of thirteen houses, but the significance of the village indicates the existence of the parish church.

The Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648) had a catastrophic impact on Jablonec - only four houses remained, It took hundred years before Jablonec recovered from the war. But in the second half of the 19th century, Jablonec grew so much that in 1896 Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria promoted the village into a Market town and granted him the Coat of arms.
An already medieval built-up area, which is probably to be found in the vicinity of the St.Prokop Church (originally wooden, from bricks since 1777 thanks to the support of Ernst Adalbert von Harrach) had more diffusive character, also the area from the second half of the 18th century was almost out of order on the slope of the valley.
The only organizational factors were contour lines and parcels of land, a completely non-agricultural dwelling were chaotically centered on the link between the church and the mill.. Thanks to the large reconstruction of the market town connected with the construction of the railway (1899) and the textile factories along the Jizera, Jablonec nad Jizerou gained the character of a modern mountainous town.


=== 20th and 21st century ===
In 1916 on the request of the market town council, the township name was extended from Jablonec to Jablonec nad Jizerou. 

In 1930, 1321 inhabitants lived in Jablonec (74% were speaking in Czech language).
In 1971 Jablonec nad Jizerou was awarded with the status of town.
Today among the new buildings from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and from the interwar period are sporadically preserved timbered cottages.


=== Etymology ===
Gabella  = Latin word for "customs"
nad  = Czech word for "Above"
Jizera  = Celts Name of the Jizera (river)
In the base of the name of the river Jizera today we read the ancient Indo-European roots - is-, which has in its name a number of wildly flowing rivers of those countries of Europe where the Celts once lived. Due to its location, there is one more explanation of the name: the word Jablonec could originate from the Latin "gabella", the customs station.


== Ski Resort ==
In Jablonec nad Jizerou there is also a ski resort, with 3.3 kilometers of downhill slopes and two ski lifts. The top of the hill is 688 meters above sea level.

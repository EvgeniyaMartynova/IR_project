Title: G&D's
Aspects: {'G&D'}

George and Davis, George and Danver and, most recently, George and Delila, collectively known as G&D′s, are three ice cream cafés in Oxford, England.


== History ==
G&D's was founded in 1992 by two Oxford students, George Stroup and Davis Roberts, who gave their names to the original café in Little Clarendon Street. They opened the café to address a lack of real ice-cream in Oxford made with fresh, local ingredients. The café opens unusually late, its hours are from 8am-midnight daily.
G&D's opened a second branch, George and Danver, on the corner of St. Aldates and Pembroke Street in 2001. A second production room was created in this shop, to make a daily selection of baked goods. Both ice-cream and bakery items are cycled from shop to shop with G&D’s own ice-cream bikes.
In 2007 a third shop, George and Delila, was opened on the Cowley Road. It has become a venue for music events and informal concerts. All three shops have a "Knowledge is Good" chalk board where the staff post different questions regularly. If a customer answers the question correctly he/she wins a free scoop of ice cream.In January 2014, George and Davis was rated one out of five for food hygiene by the Food Standards Agency. The café quickly complied with all the notices issued to them according to Oxford City Council.

The only other ice cream-themed shops in Oxford in recent years have been two outlets of the multi-national Häagen-Dazs chain: one opened in Cornmarket Street (c.a. 1993), the other opened in George Street (c.a. 1998); both shops closed within a few years of opening. Oxford's town and gown feel a loyalty towards G&D′s which they view as 'Oxford's Own'; this phrase is now incorporated in the company's logo. The flow of scholars and tourists from all nations through Oxford has given G&D′s a worldwide reputation, evident in the coverage in various international travel books including Lonely Planet.

It is owned by Chinese property developers R&F Properties as a satellite team of Chinese Super League side Guangzhou R&F.
The club's name "R&F" is short for "Rich" (富) and "Force" (力).


== History ==
R&F were founded and registered at the Hong Kong Football Association in the summer of 2016. As a satellite team of Chinese Super League side Guangzhou R&F, most of its players were loanees from the Guangzhou R&F Reserves. On 1 August 2016, they were accepted into the Hong Kong Premier League with following conditions: (1) Signing at least eight Hong Kong players. (2) Using at least three Hong Kong players in a match. (3) Sponsoring a cup competition with a fee of $1 million. The club finished their inaugural season in 10th place with 3 wins, 1 draw and 16 defeats in the 2016–17 Hong Kong Premier League, which secured their position in the top flight for the next season. 
In June 2017, R&F was allowed to move their home matches to Yanzigang Stadium in Guangzhou. They were permitted to register three foreigners for the 2017–18 Hong Kong Premier League season. R&F signed Brazilian Giovane from Eastern as well as four naturalized Hong Kong players Vas Núñez, Roberto, Itaparica and Godfred Karikari in their squad, hoping to be a more competitive team.After another disappointing season, R&F abandoned their mission of training Guangzhou R&F's reserve players. Starting with the 2018–19 season, the club's budget was increased to HK$50 million and the squad was composed mainly of Hong Kong players. Chairman Huang Shenghua claimed that the club's goal was to win at least one trophy in the season and applied for full membership within the HKFA in order to represent Hong Kong in Asian Football Confederation club competitions. The club finished as runners-up, five points behind Tai Po. 
On 28 June 2019, it was confirmed that the HKFA had accepted R&F's proposal to follow the same registration rules as other HKPL clubs. This moved meant that R&F could now register up to seven foreigners, while Chinese passport holders would no longer qualify as local players.

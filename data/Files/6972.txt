== History ==
KHYT was first assigned the AM dial position of 1330 kHz in the late 1960s as a daytime only station to serve Tucson, AZ. In 1980 then owner Robert H. Scholz moved the city of license to the city of South Tucson in order to go 24 hours a day. After the sale of the station in the mid-eighties the call letters were dropped, allowing another station to pick up the calls in 1995.
KCUB originally went on the air on the 107.5 frequency in 1993. It was called K-Cub and played new and old country hits. K-Cub was eventually moved to 1290 AM.
In 1995, the (current) station changed its call letters to become KHYT and flipped formats to classic rock hits. It used the name K-Hit 107.5.
In 2004, the name was changed to Rock 107.5, but the playlist and format stayed the same.
Recently the name has been changed back to "K-Hit 107.5" with a classic hits format, however it uses the same logo scheme.

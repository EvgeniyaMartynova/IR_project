Aspects: {"I Know Where I'm Going"}

"I Know Where I'm Going" is a traditional Scottish (some sources say Irish) ballad about a wealthy love struck young woman pining for her "bonnie" lover Johnny who some say has a bad reputation. It has been noted since the early nineteenth century. It is Roud number 5701.
In some versions the lover is said to be 'black'. This may refer to him being an outlaw or of bad reputation.

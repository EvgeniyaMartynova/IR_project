The City Hall of Moscow, Idaho, formerly known as the Moscow Post Office and Courthouse and Moscow Federal Building, was built 108 years ago in 1911.  Its red brick with ivory terracotta trim reflects Late Victorian and Eclectic architecture.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, it was vacated in 1974 when the new federal building opened two blocks away. Two years later, it was acquired by the city from the General Services Administration for $70,000, with half of that funded from the state historical society. At the time, the land alone was valued at $100,000.Rejected for use as a library in 1979, it became a community center in the early 1980s.A bond issue to fund a renovation was defeated in late 1986, it became the city hall of the municipality in the 1990s.

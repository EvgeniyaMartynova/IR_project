In 2001, following the success of the Teletubbies omnibus editions which were broadcast on the BBC on Sunday mornings, 18 40-minute episodes of the Tweenies were produced, which featured the Tweenies at home instead of playgroup, usually in their bedroom, talking about recent & past episodes from Series 4-6 which were originally broadcast in 2000-2001, with clips. These were shown intermittently in the UK on BBC Two in 2001 and BBC One in 2001 and 2003. They were repeated in 2007 on CBeebies, but have not been repeated since.

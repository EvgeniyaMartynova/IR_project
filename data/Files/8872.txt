Title: Honda N engine
Aspects: {'N series'}

The N series is Honda's first automotive diesel engine, an inline-four for medium-sized vehicles. It uses common rail direct injection, which Honda brands as i-CTDi (Intelligent Common-rail Turbocharged Direct injection). The most notable feature is the aluminium block, which uses proprietary technology in the manufacturing process to provide light weight and high rigidity. Roller chains drive two overhead camshafts. A variable-geometry turbocharger and intercooler are used.


== N16 ==
The i-DTEC engine uses a 2-Stage turbocharger from Wastegate Type & Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) left/right. It enables strong power from about 1,500 rpm. With Diesel particulate filter (DPF), IDLE STOP SYSTEM, Exhaust gas recirculation SYSTEM (EGR) & Small Size Intercooler.

== N22B ==
Whilst the N22A has the intake ports on the front of the engine, the N22B has the new standard front intake/rear exhaust port configuration. The stroke has been slightly reduced to qualify for sub-2200 cc engine displacement, for tax and registration purposes in some jurisdictions.
The N22A has exhaust on the rear of the engine.

Specifications

Bore & Stroke: 85 mm × 96.9 mm (3.35 in × 3.81 in)
Cylinder Layout: inline 4
Displacement: 2.2 L (2,199 cc)
Valve Configuration: 16-valve DOHC
Type: i-DTEC
Compression ratio: 16.3:1
Max power: 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) at 4000 rpm
Max torque: 380 N⋅m (280 lb⋅ft) at 2000 rpm
Transmission: 6MT
0-100: 8.7 sec
Top speed: 220 km/h (140 mph)"The 110 kW (150 PS; 148 hp) i-DTEC diesel engine is available with the five-speed automatic transmission only, while a six-speed manual gearbox is the sole choice in conjunction with the 132 kW (179 PS; 177 hp) high-output version.
The new, uprated 2.2 i-DTEC turbo-diesel engine's impressive maximum power output is 132 kW (179 PS; 177 hp) at 4 000 r/min, together with 380 N⋅m (280 lb⋅ft) of torque, already on tap at 2 000 r/min.Linked to its six-speed manual gearbox, the Accord accelerates from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 8,7 sec, and manages a top speed of 220 km/h (140 mph). Combined cycle fuel consumption is a frugal 5.8 L/100 km (49 mpg‑imp; 41 mpg‑US), with an associated CO2 emissions figure of 151 g (5.3 oz)/km.
In 110 kW (150 PS; 148 hp) form, the 2.2 i-DTEC, offered in automatic guise only, achieves the 0-100 km/h (62 mph) dash in 10,3 sec, while top speed comes to 207 km/h (129 mph). The combined cycle consumption comes to 6.5 L/100 km (43 mpg‑imp; 36 mpg‑US), while the CO2 emissions figure is 170 g (6.0 oz)/km."

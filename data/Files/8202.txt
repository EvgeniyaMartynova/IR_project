Title: List of motorways in the United Kingdom
Aspects: {'M road'}

The list of motorways in the United Kingdom is a complete list of motorways in the United Kingdom. Note that the numbering scheme used for Great Britain does not include roads in Northern Ireland, which are allocated numbers on an ad hoc basis.


== Great Britain ==


=== M-designated motorways ===


=== Upgraded A-road designations ===


=== Former motorways ===
Roads which used to be motorways but have been downgraded:


=== Motorways that have been renumbered ===


=== Motorways under construction or planned ===
It is proposed that the A14 upgrade between Huntingdon and Cambridge will be classified as a motorway once complete.The Adwick-le-Street to M62 stretch of the A1 is under consideration for upgrade to motorway standard, meaning the A1 between Blyth, south of Doncaster, to Birtley near Gateshead, would all be part of the same A1(M) stretch of motorway.
In addition, the proposal to put a tunnel under the river Thames in London and the revived Birmingham Western Orbital plans all are described as motorways.


=== Unbuilt motorways ===
There have been many plans for motorways in the UK that have not been built. Below is a list of plans that were not built (not exhaustive):

M12 in 3 forms (although a small part was built and is not used - a stub sliproad):From the London end of the M11 to Brentwood;
From the London end of the M11 to Maplin Sands Airport (also not built);
From the M25 (in the vicinity of the M11) to Chelmsford.
M13, from East London to Maplin Sands airport passing south of Southend.
M17 Castle Donington bypass, a short spur off the M1;
M31, a bypass of the busiest section of the M25, cutting the corner for traffic from the west. Partially built as the A329(M) and A3290.
M59, M58 junction 2 to south of Preston.
M64, between the M6 south of Stoke-on-Trent and the M1 near Derby. Mostly built as the A50.
M601, which would have entered Manchester from the M62 (now the M60) in the Irwell Valley at Clifton near Pendlebury.
M650, Airedale Motorway from near Silsden to Shipley.
A6(M) (or M66 extension), which would have formed an eastern bypass for Stockport. As of March 2006, this is still under the planning stage as part of the SEMMMS (south east Manchester multi modal study) project (though not as motorway).
A556(M), which would have cut the corner between the M6 and M56 near Warrington.
Chippenham Spur, off the M4
Strensham – Solihull motorway, a link between the M50 and M42 or M69
Most of the M67 – from Hattersley to the M1 via the Hope Valley in the Peak District national park and Sheffield. Various routes have been proposed but have yet to come to fruition due to controversy and/or expense. In 2014, the then Sheffield Hallam MP and Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg signalled his support for improvements to the Woodhead Pass. The latest proposal to extend the M67 is to tunnel under the Peak District from Hattersley to Stannington (an outer-suburb of Sheffield) and to link that tunnel to a new underground motorway providing links to the M1.Many cities had urban motorway plans, most of which were not built. London, Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester/SELNEC and Glasgow all had extensive plans.


== Northern Ireland ==


=== M-designated motorways ===


=== Upgraded A-road designations ===


=== Unbuilt motorways ===
The following motorways were planned, but never built.

M11, from the M1 going through Lisburn and then crossing the M1 again and ending at Newry
M23, from the M2 to DerryThere were also urban motorway plans for Belfast

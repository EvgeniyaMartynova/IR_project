Title: Kuala Lumpur–Kuala Selangor Expressway
Aspects: {'E25'}

The Kuala Lumpur–Kuala Selangor Expressway  (Malay: Lebuhraya Kuala Lumpur–Kuala Selangor), KLS (formerly Ijok–Templer Park Highway (Malay: Lebuhraya Ijok–Taman Templer), LATAR) or sometimes called  LATAR Expressway (Malay: Lebuhraya LATAR),, is an expressway in Selangor, Malaysia. It is part of the Kuala Lumpur Outer Ring Road. The 32 km (20 mi) expressway connects Ijok near Kuala Selangor to Templer's Park near Rawang and not Kuala Lumpur as its name suggests – consequently, motorists will need to travel another 20 km to Kuala Lumpur via Kuala Lumpur–Rawang Highway. Kuala Lumpur–Kuala Selangor Expressway is the fourth east–west-oriented expressway in the Klang Valley after the Federal Highway, the New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE) and the Shah Alam Expressway.

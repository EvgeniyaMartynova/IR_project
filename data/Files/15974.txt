A news report in late-2018 speculated that the film would be released in February 2019. But a delay caused the release date to be pushed to 5 April, targeting a Ugadi release. After actor Nikhil Kumar announced his participation in the 2019 Indian general elections, the release date was further postponed as promotion of a candidate is prohibited during the elections. Producer Munirathna remarked, "The film is made in both 2D and 3D and it has got delayed due to the extensive graphics. Now, we are ready with the product and as planned, I am very keen to release this in April first week. But since Nikhil is part of our film, if I want to go ahead with the planned release date, I will have to lose out the entire Mysuru region." The film was later slated to be released on 9 August but pulled forward by a week in order to avoid clash in screen allotment with another multi-language release Saaho. Later it was rescheduled to 9 August to coincide with the festival of Varamahalakshmi Vrata.

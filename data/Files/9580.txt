Title: Oldenburgia grandis
Aspects: {'O. grandis'}

Oldenburgia grandis is a shrub or small, gnarled tree in the family Asteraceae. It occurs in the mountains around Grahamstown in South Africa. It grows to a height of about 5m on sandstone outcrops. It has thick corky bark and large leaves clustered at the ends of branches. The leaves are dark green and leathery, reminiscent of loquat leaves, but generally a good deal larger. The emergent leaves are densely and completely felted with white hair. Most of the felt is lost as the leaf matures, but some persists on under-surfaces. Flowers are purple and in large heads about 12 cm in diameter. The flowerheads are solitary and terminal.
It is threatened by habitat loss.

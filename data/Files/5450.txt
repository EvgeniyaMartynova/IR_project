Title: I Am Love (song)
Aspects: {'I Am Love'}

"I Am Love" (from Dancing Machine) was the Jackson 5's last Top 20 hit (#15 in 1975) as the group later left Motown for CBS.
Released in late 1974 as a single, it was one of the group's album-oriented efforts as the song went beyond the usual playing time of a pop song, at around 7 minutes and 30 seconds. The song was part-soul ballad (led by Jermaine) and part-funk/rock dance anthem (led mostly by Michael).
On the single release, "Part 1" is an edited version of the entire album track, while "Part 2" is an edit of the faster-tempo second section. After the song's success, the group released their last Motown album, Moving Violation, before leaving the label in 1976.
It charted at #3 on the US Billboard R&B chart and #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, but was not a hit in the UK Singles Chart.
It was performed by the Jackson 5 on The Cher Show in 1975, and by the Jacksons on their TV series in 1977. A live performance by the Jacksons, at a concert in Mexico in late 1975, was included on the home video, The Jacksons In Concert, released in 1981 in the UK (no USA release).

Title: R40 Live Tour
Aspects: {'R40'}

The R40 Live Tour was the final tour by Canadian rock band Rush that commemorated the 40th anniversary of drummer Neil Peart joining the band in July 1974. The title hearkens back to Rush's 2004 R30: 30th Anniversary Tour that celebrated the 30 year anniversary of the band. The tour began on May 8 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and concluded in Inglewood, California, on August 1. The shows performed on June 17 and 19, 2015, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto were filmed and released as the concert film R40 Live on November 20, 2015. Portions of the shows in Kansas City, Missouri, on July 9, and Buffalo, New York, on June 10 were included as bonus tracks on the album.

== Name ==
"We Are America" was a popular slogan and chant sung during pro-immigrant marches of the 2006 immigration reform protests in the United States, along with "SÃ­ se puede" ("Yes, it's possible", meaning that people's power and immigration reform were possible). It pointed to the fact that undocumented immigrants although not lawfully present in the United States of America, were part of the nation as families and workers.  
Many regional immigrant rights coalitions sprung up across the country that adopted "We Are America" as their name;  among those are the We Are America Coalition of Arizona and the We Are America Coalition of Southern California.

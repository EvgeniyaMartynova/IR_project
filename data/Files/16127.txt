Title: Shaanxi Y-9
Aspects: {'Y9'}

The Shaanxi Y-9 (Chinese: 运-9; pinyin: Yùn-9) aircraft is a medium-sized, medium-range transport aircraft produced by Shaanxi Aircraft Company in China.  The aircraft was developed as a stretched version of the Shaanxi Y-8F with greater payload and range originating from the Soviet Antonov An-12.  The Y-9 is considered China's effort to build a C-130J class transport aircraft.


== Development ==
Originally known as the Y-8X project, the development of Y-9 began in 2001 to produce a C-130J class transport to replace the older Y-8.  Shaanxi Aircraft Industry showed models of the aircraft as the Y-9 at the 2005 International Aviation Expo in Beijing, to promote its use as a civilian transport. However, development was met with various technical challenges, and the maiden flight date slipped from 2006 to 2007, then 2008.  Shaanxi had intended to produce its first production model for the PLAAF in 2009.The Y-9 is powered by four Wojiang FWJ-6C turboprop engines, and equipped with 6-bladed JL-4 composite propellers.  The tail ramp is capable of handling vehicle cargo.  The aircraft is capable of transporting 25 tons of cargo, or configured with 106 troop seats in the troop transport role, or 72 stretchers for the medical evacuation role, or up to 132 armed paratroopers in the para-drop role. The dimension of the cargo bay is 16.2m X 3.2m X 2.35m (length X width X height).
In January 2010 it was reported that the Y-9 design had been frozen but no aircraft would be constructed until an order was placed. A first flight of the new transport could take place by 2011. As of the summer of 2012 the Y-9 has become operational with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).

Title: Rhus chinensis
Aspects: {'R. chinensis'}

Rhus chinensis, the Chinese sumac, or nutgall tree, is a plant species in the genus Rhus.
Galls produced on the species that are called Chinese gall, Galla Chinensis, or Wu Bei Zi (五倍子) in Chinese, are a source of gallotannins, molecules of hydrolyzable tannins. Infestation of the tree by Chinese sumac aphids  (Melaphis chinensis Bell) may lead to production of a gall that is valued as a commercial product in China.
Chinese galls are used in traditional Chinese medicine for coughs, diarrhea, night sweats, dysentery, and intestinal and uterine bleeding.  Some research has suggested that chemical compounds found in Rhus chinensis possess in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antidiarrheal, and antioxidant activities. However, it is important to note that this evidence is not substantiated by multiple international researchers.  The aqueous extracts of the gall also inhibit alpha-glucosidase activity in vitro.

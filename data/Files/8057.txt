== Plot ==
Twenty-one-year-old Valentine (Sophie Marceau) is a part-time teacher preparing for her all-important final teaching examinations. She meets Edouard (Vincent Lindon), a jazz musician who aspires to be a composer. Despite their different schedules and career agenda, they engage in a passionate affair. Valentine compares her relationship with Edouard to the dry dissertation of Molière's The Misanthrope in her oral exams at the Sorbonne.

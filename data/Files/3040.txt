Title: Kishinoue's giant skink
Aspects: {'E. kishinouyei'}

Kishinoue's giant skink (Plestiodon kishinouyei) is a species of skink, a lizard in the family Scincidae, endemic to the southern Ryukyu Islands of Japan.
The species name is a tribute to Japanese fisheries biologist Kamakichi Kishinouye (岸上 鎌吉, 1867-1929). 


== Description ==
P. kishinouyei is about 30-40 cm in total length (including tail), with a snout to vent length of 14.0–17.2 cm. It is the largest member of its widely distributed, speciose genus, and thus appears to be an example of island gigantism.

Title: The Hunger for More
Aspects: {'I Get High (disambiguation)'}

The Hunger for More is the debut album by Lloyd Banks, released June 29, 2004 on G-Unit Records and Interscope Records.


== Background ==
The hit singles from this album include "On Fire", "I'm So Fly", and "Karma". Features on this album include 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and The Game.
During the first week of The Hunger For More's release, a distribution house in Manhattan was robbed of approximately eight boxes of the CDs (200 copies). A New York record store had nearly 100 copies of the CD stolen from its racks by a single perpetrator on the album's first day in stores, though they were later recovered.


=== Concept ===
During an interview Lloyd Banks explained the reason behind naming the album. He said: When I say The Hunger for More, it could be referring to more success. It could be more money. Or Respect. More power. More understanding. All those things lead up to that hunger for more, because my more isn't everybody else's more. I feel like I made it already, because I got already what everybody on the corners of the neighborhood I grew up in is striving to get.

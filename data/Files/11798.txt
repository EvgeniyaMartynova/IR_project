Title: Roseomonas vinacea
Aspects: {'R. vinacea'}

Roseomonas vinacea is a species of Gram negative, strictly aerobic, coccobacilli-shaped, wine-red-colored bacterium. It was first isolated from a soil sample collected from the Tibetan Plateau, China, and the species was first proposed in 2008. The species name is derived from Latin vinacea (of or belonging to wine or to the grape), referring to the color that the bacterial colonies form.
The optimum growth temperature for R. vinacea is 30-32 °C, but can grow in the 4-40 °C range. The optimum pH is 7.0-7.5 and can grow at pH 6.5-8.0.

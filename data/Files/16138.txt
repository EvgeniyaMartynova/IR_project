Title: Harbin Y-12
Aspects: {'Y12'}

The Harbin Y-12 (Chinese: 运-12; pinyin: Yùn-12) is a high wing twin-engine turboprop utility aircraft built by Harbin Aircraft Industry Group (HAIG).


== Design and development ==
The Y-12 started as a development of the Harbin Y-11 airframe called Y-11T in 1980. The design featured numerous improvements including a redesigned wing with a new low drag section, a larger fuselage and bonded rather than riveted construction.
The first prototype, followed by about 30 production Y-12 (I) aircraft before a revised version was produced.   This was designated the Y-12 (II), which featured more powerful engines and removal of leading edge slats, first flying on 16 August 1984 and receiving Chinese certification in December of the following year. The power plants are two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-27 turboprops with Hartzell propellers. The Y-12 has a maximum takeoff weight of 5,700 kg (12,600 lb) with seating for 17 passengers and two crew. The aircraft is operated as a light commuter and transport aircraft.
The latest development is Y-12F, which is almost a new design with many improvements: new wings, new landing gears, new fuselage, with more powerful engines from Pratt & Whitney Canada and extended payload and range. The Y-12F made its maiden flight on December 29, 2010, received the CAAC type certification on December 10, 2015, and the FAA type certification on February 22, 2016. In 2015 Kenmore Air announced that they would begin development of floats for the Y-12 for FAA certification.The Y-12 completed the FAA evaluation flight tests for its automatic flight control system on June 30, 2018, with its performance meeting the requirements, said AVIC Harbin Aircraft Industry Company Ltd (AVIC HAFEI).


== Variants ==

Y-12 (I): Twin-engined STOL utility transport aircraft, powered by two 500-shp (373-kW) Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-11 turboprop engines. Prototype version.
Y-12 (II): Fitted with more powerful PT6A-27 engines.
Y-12 (III): Planned version to be fitted with WJ-9 turboprop. Evolved to Y-12C because of IV's success when WJ-9 development was completed.
Y-12 (IV): Improved version. Revised wingtips (span increased to 19.2 m (63 ft)) and increased takeoff weight. 19 passenger seats. This version is the first aircraft in the series certified by the FAA in 1995.
Y-12C: Basically a (IV) version with WJ-9 turboprop, now used by PLAAF for aerial survey.
Y-12D: Domestically deployed military version with upgraded engines driving four-bladed propellers, now used by PLA Airborne Corps for parachute training.
Y-12E: Variant with 18 passenger seats. PT6A-135A engines of equal horsepower but increased torque driving four-bladed propellers. This version was certified by the FAA in 2006.
Y-12F: The latest development with almost everything redesigned: wider fuselage, new wings, retractable landing gear and more powerful  PT6A-65B engines. The Y-12F has higher cruise speed, longer range and can accommodate 19 passengers or 3x LD3 containers. Design started in April 2005 and the maiden flight was on 29 December 2010. CAAC type certification was received on 10 December 2015 and FAA certification on 22 February 2016. The Y-12F aloso passed flight tests for its automatic flight control system by the FAA on 30 June 2018. It has been also demonstrated during the 2012 Zhuhai Airshow.
Y-12G: Proposed cargo version of Y-12F.
Turbo Panda: Export name for (II) version, marketed by England and Japanese companies. No real order due to airworthiness certification.
Twin Panda: Originally (II) version for export. Later a modified Y-12 (IV) powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-34 turboprop engines and fitted with uprated undercarriage, upgraded avionics and interior. Thirty-five orders reportedly received by 2000 but production not proceeded with.

Title: United States S-class submarine
Aspects: {'S-boat', 'S-class submarine'}

The United States' S-class submarines, often simply called S-boats (sometimes "Sugar" boats, after the then-contemporary Navy phonetic alphabet for "S"), were the first class of submarines with a significant number built to United States Navy designs. Others of this class were built to contractor designs.
The United States Navy commissioned 51 S-class submarines from 1920 to 1925. The first S-boat, USS S-1 (SS-105), was commissioned in 1920 and the last numerically, USS S-51 (SS-162), in 1922. The last of the class actually commissioned was USS S-47 (SS-158) in 1925. The S class is subdivided into four groups of different designs:

Group I (S-1 class, or "Holland" type): 25 boats, S-1 and S-18 to S-41, built by Bethlehem Steel at Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts and Union Iron Works in San Francisco, California, as subcontractors for the designer, the Electric Boat Company.
Group II (S-3 class, or "Navy Yard" type): 15 boats, S-3 to S-17, built at the Portsmouth Navy Yard and Lake Torpedo Boat at Bridgeport, Connecticut.
Group III (S-42 class, or "2nd Holland" type): 6 boats, S-42 to S-47, built at Fore River.
Group IV (S-48 class, or "2nd Navy Yard" type): 4 boats, S-48 to S-51, built by Lake.S-2 was a prototype built by Lake, and was not repeated.
S-1, S-2, and S-3 were prototypes built to the same specification: S-1 designed by Electric Boat, S-2 by Lake, and S-3 by the Bureau of Construction and Repair (BuC&R) (later Bureau of Ships). The S-2 Lake boat was considered inferior. The Electric Boat and BuC&R designs were put into production as Group I and Group II.
SS-159 to SS-168 (2nd Holland) and SS-173 to SS-176 (2nd Navy Yard) were cancelled and, contrary to later practice, the hull numbers were used for subsequent submarines. Some of the material for these was used by Electric Boat to build the Peruvian Navy's four R-boats.
The first S-boat, S-1, was launched on 26 September 1918, by Bethlehem at Fore River, but not commissioned until 5 June 1920.


== Design ==
There were three distinctly different prototypes for the S-boats. The Electric Boat (EB) design formed the basis for the Group I and Group IV boats and were essentially enlarged versions of all their previous designs. A single hull design, all of the ballast tanks were contained within the pressure hull. The hull was a rounded spindle shape and the rudder was placed at the very end of the hull, aft of the twin screws. Compared to the previous R-boats, Group I S-boats were 33 feet (10.1 m) longer, with 3 feet 3 inches (1.0 m) more beam, 2 feet 3 inches (0.7 m) more draft, and 60% greater displacement. This allowed for greater range, larger engines and higher speed, and more torpedo reloads, though the number of forward torpedo tubes was unchanged.
The Lake design, S-2, was a modified double hull type, with ballast tanks wrapped around the inner pressure hull. The stern ended in a flat "shovel" shape which gave the stern needed buoyancy. The rudder was mounted beneath the stern and the pivot structure also supported the stern diving planes. To gain surface buoyancy, the superstructure atop the boat was partially watertight. Sea trials showed that the bow tended to burrow into the waves so Lake added a buoyancy tank to the bow, which gave it a humped appearance. This boat suffered from poor maneuverability and was overcomplicated. It proved to be unreliable and was not well liked by its crew. The Navy did not choose it for mass production and no further boats were produced to this design.Seven of the Group II and all the Group IV boats had an additional stern tube. Group IV was also longer and had less draft. The Electric Boat designs (Groups I and III) were single-hulled, the others were double-hulled. All S-boats had a 4-inch (102 mm)/50 caliber deck gun, a significant increase over the 3-inch gun of previous US submarines. This was due to observations that the German U-boats frequently used their deck guns, and many U-boats were equipped with 105 mm (4.1-inch) deck guns. Another improvement was the conning tower fairwater. Previous US submarines had small fairwaters to reduce drag and improve submerged speed. Experience gained on North Atlantic patrols during WWI showed that the boats would be spending considerable time on the surface and thus needed better protection for the bridge watchstanders. Examination of captured U-boats after the Armistice also showed that a larger fairwater with permanent grab rails was preferable when surfaced in the North Atlantic, so S-boats were built or backfitted with an improved and much larger fairwater.Future admiral Hyman G. Rickover was assigned to USS S-48 (SS-159). He later credited the "faulty, sooty, dangerous and repellent engineering" of the S-class boats with inspiring his obsession for high engineering standards.In 1923, USS S-1 (SS-105) experimented with a float plane (an idea the Japanese would later adopt). A cylindrical hangar was installed on the after deck to house a single Martin MS-1 float plane. Tests showed the concept to be unworkable, and the equipment was subsequently removed. The hangar was later reused and rebuilt as the prototype for the McCann Rescue Chamber, a diving bell for rescuing crewmen from sunken submarines.


== Service ==
These boats saw service in World War II in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Smaller and slower than the later fleet submarines produced for war service, and lacking the range for Pacific Ocean patrols (as well as being 20 years old), they were used in reconnaissance and supply roles, as well as for coastal defense. S-boats operated in the Alaska theater during the aftermath of the Battle of the Aleutian Islands, based out of Dutch Harbor. Some also operated out of Australia in the Southwest Pacific Area. They were withdrawn from front-line service by late 1943 as more Gato-class fleet submarines became available, and were relegated to ASW training. Most of the surviving boats were scrapped in 1946.
In World War II, S-class boats did not use the newer Mark 14 torpedo, standard in fleet submarines, due to shorter torpedo tubes, relying on the World War I-vintage Mark 10 instead. (Due to production shortages, many fleet boats used Mark 10s, also. Since the Mark 14 suffered from a high failure rate early in the war, this was not necessarily a disadvantage.)
During World War II, 37 S-boats were in service when the United States entered the war in December 1941.  20 S-boats were awarded battle stars and 17 were credited with sinking a collective total of 42 Japanese ships.  Six commissioned S-boats were lost during the war - 5 to accidents and 1 in combat.
Some S-class boats were transferred to other navies, such as the six transferred to the British Royal Navy (one in 1941 and five in 1942). These were mostly used for training in anti-submarine warfare and removed from service by mid-1944.
As newer submarines were put in service during World War II, S-boats were withdrawn from combat service and provided training support instead.  Starting in late 1944, a total of 11 boats were decommissioned and used for experimental purposes, including being sunk by experimental weapons. 
13 S-boats were still in service when the Japanese surrendered on 2 September 1945.

USS S-29 (SS-134) (as P.556) returned to US on paper in 1946 after battery explosion, partially scrapped in UK 1947, scrapping completed in Spain 1987


=== Lost during World War II ===
7 submarines (1 to enemy action)

USS S-26 (SS-131) was destroyed in a collision with USS Sturdy (PC-460) in the Gulf of Panama 24 January 1942; probably mistaken for a U-boat.
USS S-27 (SS-132), USS S-36 (SS-141), and USS S-39 (SS-144) were wrecked when they ran aground in separate incidents.
USS S-28 (SS-133) sunk 4 July 1944 by a flooding casualty off Pearl Harbor.
USS S-44 (SS-155) lost to enemy action 7 October 1943.
USS S-49 (SS-160) stricken and sold for scrap 1931; hulked 1936; hulk reacquired by the U.S. Navy for "experimental purposes"; foundered and sank in the Patuxent River 16 December 1942. This is not counted among the 52 US submarines lost during World War II, as the vessel was not in commission at the time.


=== Other fates ===
11 S-boats were decommissioned in 1944 and 1945 prior to the surrender of Japan.  They were mostly expended as targets.  
13 S-boats were in commission when the Japanese surrendered on 2 September 1945.  All except one, USS S-15 (SS-120), were decommissioned by the end of November 1945.  S-15 was decommissioned in June 1946.

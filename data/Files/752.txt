== Description ==
Basella alba is a fast-growing, soft-stemmed vine, reaching 10 metres (33 ft) in length.  Its thick, semi-succulent, heart-shaped leaves have a mild flavour and mucilaginous texture.  It is rich in vitamins A and C, iron and calcium. It has been shown to contain certain phenolic phytochemicals, and it has antioxidant properties.It is also called Malabar Spinach. There are two varieties - green and red. The stem of the Basella alba is green with green leaves and the stem of the cultivar Basella alba 'Rubra' is reddish-purple; the leaves form green and as the plant reaches maturity as a anual, older leaves will develop purple pigment starting at the base of the leave and working towards the end. The stem when crushed usually emits a strong scent. Malabar spinach can be found at many Asian supermarkets, as well as farmers' markets.


=== Soil and climate requirements ===
Basella alba grows well under full sunlight in hot, humid climates and in areas lower than 500 metres (1,600 ft) above sea level. The plant is native to tropical Asia.
Growth is slow in low temperatures resulting in low yields. Flowering is induced during the short-day months of the year. It grows best in sandy loam soils rich in organic matter with pH ranging from 5.5 to 8.0.


== Uses ==

In the Philippines, the leaves of this vegetable are one of the main ingredients in an all vegetable dish called utan that is served over rice.

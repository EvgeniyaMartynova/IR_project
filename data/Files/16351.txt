== Critical reception ==
Indiaglitz offered the following review:Yagam could be avoided; Tollywood has seen better murder mysteries and this one fall flat. Arun Prasad has not anchored the ship well and flaws in screenplay are apparent. The mystery being revealed half way through just dampens the film and from there on all the cast and the audience go through the motions. With all the good resources at the director's disposal Yagam could have been made better!

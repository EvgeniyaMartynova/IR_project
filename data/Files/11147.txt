Title: WHDQ
Aspects: {'Q106'}

WHDQ (106.1 FM, "Q106") is a radio station broadcasting a classic rock format. Licensed to Claremont, New Hampshire, United States, the station serves the Lebanon-Rutland-White River Junction area.  The station is owned by Jeffrey Shapiro's Great Eastern Radio.  The station's transmitter is located atop Mount Ascutney in Vermont.  WHDQ's signal is also broadcast over a translator—W294AB (106.7 FM) in Hanover, New Hampshire—and a booster—WHDQ-FM1 in Rutland, Vermont
Q106 has arguably one of the richest and most colorful histories of any radio station in northern New England. What originally started out as a top-40 powerhouse in the mid-1980s to late 1992 evolved into a rock and roll powerhouse going forward after that. Q106 was one of the first radio stations to carry the Imus in the Morning show, and one of the first stations to reinstate the show upon Imus' return to the airwaves in December 2007.
Q106 also has the honor of being the first FM station in New Hampshire to sign on the air as WTSV-FM at 102.1 in 1948.
WHDQ, along with 29 other stations in northern New England formerly owned by Nassau Broadcasting Partners, was purchased at bankruptcy auction by Carlisle Capital Corporation, a company controlled by Bill Binnie (owner of WBIN-TV in Derry), on May 22, 2012. The station, and 12 of the other stations, were then acquired by Vertical Capital Partners, controlled by Jeff Shapiro. The deal was completed on November 30, 2012. The Vertical Capital Partners stations were transferred to Shapiro's existing Great Eastern Radio group on January 1, 2013.

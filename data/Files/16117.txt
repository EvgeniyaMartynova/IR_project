Title: Mazda Diesel engine
Aspects: {'Y6'}

Mazda has a long history of building its own Diesel engines, with the exception of a few units that were built under license.


== Inline-fours ==
PN - 1.7 L (1,720 cc) - Used in the Mazda Familia and Ford Laser
R2 - 2.2 L (2,184 cc) - Used in the 1984 onwards Mazda Bongo
SL - 3.5 L (3,455 cc) - Used in the T3500 light truck (Mazda Titan)
TF - 4.0 L (4,021 cc) -
TM - 4.6 L (4,553 cc) -
VS - 3.0 L (2,956 cc) -
WL - 2.5 L (2,499 cc), bore x stroke 93 mm × 92 mm (3.66 in × 3.62 in) - naturally aspirated or turbodiesel, used in non-US 1995 Mazda MPV, various Mazda B-Series trucks.

XC - 3.7 L (3,663 cc) -


=== Perkins ===
These three engines (GA/GB/GC in Perkins' internal parlance) were developed especially for Mazda and were never offered by Perkins themselves.

S2 - 2.2 L (2,209 cc) - License built Perkins 4.135 related to HA and XA, used in 1979 to 1986 Mazda Luce, Bongo/E2200, B2200, Ford Ranger
XA - 2.5 L (2,522 cc) - License built Perkins 4.154 related to HA and S2, used in 1970 Mazda E2500 and 1971 Mazda Titan, and some Bobcat skid-steer loaders. A six-cylinder version of this is called the "YA".
HA - 3.0 L (2,977 cc) - License built Perkins 4.182 related to S2 and XAAll of these engines have cast iron blocks and heads, two overhead valves per cylinder driven by maintenance-free timing gears, crossflow heads, are indirect injection. US-market B2200 and Ford Ranger trucks - and possibly the others as well - had rotary Bosch VE-style injection pumps, built by Diesel Kiki under license from Bosch.


=== RF ===
A diesel variation of the 2.0 L (1,998 cc) FE engine which shares its square internal dimensions of 86 mm × 86 mm (3.39 in × 3.39 in) bore and stroke - it is virtually the same block, with identical bell housing pattern and block dimensions. This could be a testament to the F-block's strength as it was over-built for naturally aspirated duty. Its alloy head is entirely different though, with valves directly actuated rather than the rockers of the FE. The glow plugs are located in remote combustion chambers, with fuel delivered by a mechanical pump. The RF is light, with the original naturally aspirated version weighing in at 146 kg (322 lb), 10 kg (22 lb); more than the FE. The RF The RF and R2 continue production to this day as the MZR-CD, with counter-rotating balance-shafts mounted between the engine block and oil pan as well as much evolved head and direct-injection technology. The RF is a SOHC, two valves-per-cylinder engine. One of Mazda's more popular diesel engines, it was also available with a pressure wave supercharger called Comprex.

=== RF 1998 ===
Latest emission improved version used in Mazda 323 adopts a new swirl chamber with an enlarged volume, revised swirl-chamber-to-main-chamber ratio and a narrower throat area. Engine produces 52 kW (71 PS; 70 hp) at 4500 rpm on a raised 21.7:1 compression ratio, and has an exceptionally wide spread of torque throughout its range, peaking with 128 N⋅m (94 lb⋅ft) at 3000 rpm.
Further engine features:

=== RF-T DI 1998 (2.0 DiTD) ===
A direct-injection turbo version 101 bhp (75 kW; 102 PS) with four valves per cylinder, called the DiTD was introduced in the June 1998 Mazda 626 Wagon 2.0 DiTD. Engine has SOHC valve train with rocker arms and mechanically adjusted screws (no hydraulic valve lifters), with Denso V5 rotary injection pump and Denso PCM.
There were three power versions:

66 kW (90 PS; 89 hp) at 4000 rpm with maximum torque 220 N⋅m (162 lb⋅ft) at 1800 rpm
74 kW (101 PS; 99 hp) at 4000 rpm with maximum torque 220 N⋅m (162 lb⋅ft) at 1800–2200 rpm

Mazda Premacy as DE 2.0L (DIREC-D) Euro III


=== RF 2002 (2.0 MZR-CD) ===
Next evolution of RF engine with common rail direct-injection was introduced in June 2002 European version Mazda 6 with output power 89 kW (121 PS; 119 hp) or 100 kW (136 PS; 134 hp) (both at 3500 rpm), depending on engine version (only difference between the two diesel drivetrains is the shape of their respective torque curves, the larger of the two engines being flatter). 2002 RF Mazda diesel engine includes new dual-mass flywheel and common rail Denso injection with max. pressure of 1800 bar, pilot and post-injection for operating smoothness and soft and acoustically unobtrusive combustion. Both versions have same compression ratio 18.3:1. Torque output (both versions have same maximum 310 N⋅m (229 lb⋅ft) at 2000 rpm), fuel efficiency and NOx emissions were improved by using:

expansive vertical vortex combustion (EVVC), which combines a special piston surface design, with ingenious fuel distribution, to produce a vertical swirl in the combustion chamber
variable turbine geometry (VNT) turbochargerCombined fuel economy is achieving 6.5 L/100 km (43 mpg‑imp; 36 mpg‑US) and emission rating Euro Stage III (D4) with on a regular basis mounted catalytic converter with Lambda probe and exhaust-gas recirculation system (EGR).
Engines were mounted in (in order of appearance):

1st generation Mazda 6 Atenza (both versions) since June 2002
2nd generation Mazda MPV (only High Power version) since June 2002


=== RF 2005 (2.0 MZR-CD) ===
Production of improved, cleaner and more powerful common rail direct-injection turbocharged version of Mazda RF engine was started with July 2005 Mazda 6 facelift. This drivetrain still has most of typical features of its predecessor including belt-driven SOHC valve train with rocker arms and mechanically adjusted screws (in contrast to frequently mismatched, absolutely different ZSD or PSA DW10 Ford Duratorq engines). Mazda applied several technologies to this MZR-CD engine to achieve Euro Stage IV:

new variable geometry turbocharger has 14 percent less inertial moment and is more compact in design (achieved, for instance, by a shorter distance between the exhaust gas inlet and the turbine shaft)
Denso's 1800 bar second generation common rail system that, depending on driving conditions, uses multi-stage injection of up to nine times per cycle with six-hole injectors
relatively low compression ratio of 16.7:1 improves power output and torque(???), while at the same time helping to lower combustion noise and emissions
NOx emissions were reduced by lowering the engine's combustion temperature
O2 sensor constantly measures residual oxygen in the exhaust gases and this information is sent to 32-bit powertrain control module (PCM), which continuously optimizes the air/fuel mixThere were two power versions of this engine: Standard Power 89 kW (121 PS; 119 hp) at 3500 rpm and a maximum torque of 320 N⋅m (236 lb⋅ft) at 2000 rpm, High Power 105 kW (143 PS; 141 hp) at 3500 rpm and a maximum torque of 360 N⋅m (266 lb⋅ft) at 2000 rpm. Both versions come with a DPF system standard, which traps soot in a coated ceramic filter. As soon as the filter's storage capacity is exhausted, exhaust gas temperature is raised for a short period (using only diesel pre and post-injection techniques, not any fuel burner additive) and the particles burn off. As a result, the RF 2005 engines emit 80 percent less particulate matter than required by Euro Stage IV standards.
Engines were mounted in (in order of appearance):

1st generation Mazda 6 Atenza (both versions) since July 2005
Mazda 5 Premacy (both versions) since January 2006
1st generation Mazda 3 Axela (only High Power version) since March 2007


=== RF 2007 (2.0 MZR-CD) ===
Slightly detuned 103 kW (140 PS; 138 hp) at 3500 rpm and 330 N⋅m (243 lb⋅ft) at 2000 rpm) version of RF 2005 engine was introduced in November 2007's second generation Mazda 6. Newly calibrated powertrain control module mapping resulted in better drivability, fuel efficiency and emission performance. This engine has changed layout of the intake/exhaust, with more efficient EGR cooler, better DPF and combined fuel consumption 5.6 L/100 km (50 mpg‑imp; 42 mpg‑US), less than its predecessor.
Engine was mounted in (in order of appearance):

2nd generation Mazda 6 Atenza since November 2007

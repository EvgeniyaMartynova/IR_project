Title: 2012 United States House of Representatives elections
Aspects: {'U.S. Congress election, 2012'}

The 2012 United States House of Representatives elections were held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. It coincided with the reelection of President Barack Obama.  Elections were held for all 435 seats representing the 50 U.S. states and also for the delegates from the District of Columbia and five major U.S. territories. The winners of this election cycle served in the 113th United States Congress. This was the first congressional election using districts drawn-up based on the 2010 United States Census.
Although Democratic candidates received a nationwide plurality of more than 1.4 million votes (1.2%) in all House elections, the Republican Party won a 33-seat advantage in the state-apportioned totals, thus retaining its House majority by 17 seats. Democrats had picked up 27 seats, enough to win back control of the House, but most of these gains were canceled out due to Republican gains as well as reapportionment, leaving the Democrats with a net gain of 8 seats. This disparity – common in close elections involving single-member district voting – has generally been attributed to targeted, widespread Republican gerrymandering in the congressional redistricting process following the 2010 United States Census. Some analysts believe that in addition to Republican gerrymandering, other factors that helped the GOP maintain control of congress, despite getting fewer votes, included the large number of Democratic votes in urban centers which led to "unintentional gerrymandering," as compact districts naturally led to "wasted votes" in districts that easily elected Democratic candidates. The GOP also had a greater number of incumbents, who tend to have an advantage in elections.In the previous century, on four occasions the party with a plurality of the popular vote was unable to receive a majority in the House, but only twice since World War II. The last times were in 1952 and 1996, in which the GOP held a majority in the House. The 1942 election was the last time that the Democrats held a majority in the House without winning the popular vote.

== Pre-election analysis and selected results ==
The following are the predictions for House districts where at least one out of The Cook Political Report, the Rothenberg Political Report, Roll Call, and Sabato's Crystal Ball did not agree that the district was "safe Democrat" or "safe Republican". Ratings from the New York Times are also included
Key:

Incumbents not running for re-election have parentheses around their name;
"(Open)" means that the seat was created in a state that gained one or more seats as the result of the 2010 census;
Where two incumbents are shown, that is also because of redistricting.


== Separate elections ==
There were five special elections in 2012. Winners will have a seniority advantage over other freshmen.

Two elections were held separate from the November elections.
Three elections were held concurrent with the November elections, see below.


== November elections ==
Note: This list includes only candidates on the final ballot.


=== Alabama ===


=== Alaska ===


=== Arizona ===

Arizona gained one seat in reapportionment. A second open seat was created when a pair of Republicans were redistricted into the same district. Primary elections were August 28, 2012.


=== Arkansas ===


=== California ===

California retained its fifty-three seats: four new seats were created when four pairs of Representatives were redistricted to run against each other. An additional Republican incumbent, Gary Miller, won re-election in an entirely different district from the one he had previously represented. The election featured the first use of the top-two primary system in which primary elections list candidates from all parties on one ballot, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election. Two elections (30th and 44th districts) featured two Democratic incumbents running against each other.


=== Colorado ===


=== Connecticut ===

Primary elections were held August 14, 2012.


=== Delaware ===


=== Florida ===

Florida gained two seats in reapportionment. As a result of the Fair Districts Amendment, approved by voters via referendum in 2010, the legislature could not take incumbency into account in drawing the lines. As a result, two incumbent Republicans, John Mica and Sandy Adams, were drawn into the same district, creating a third new seat.


=== Georgia ===

Georgia gained one seat in reapportionment.


=== Hawaii ===


=== Idaho ===


=== Illinois ===

Illinois lost one seat in reapportionment, forcing a pair of incumbent Republicans into the same district.

A third incumbent impacted by redistricting, Gary Ackerman, chose to retire, creating an open seat.

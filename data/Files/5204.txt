Title: Head & Shoulders
Aspects: {'H&S'}

Head & Shoulders (H&S) is an American brand of anti-dandruff and non-dandruff shampoo produced by parent company Procter & Gamble that was introduced in 1961.By 1982, it was the "number one brand" of shampoo, and it was noted that "[n]o one hair care brand gets so many ad dollars as Head & Shoulders, a twenty year old brand, and no other brand matches its sales", despite it being a "medicated" shampoo. Since the 1980s, the brand has long been marketed under the tagline, "You Never Get a Second Chance to Make a First Impression", which has been identified as an example of "anxiety marketing" commonly used by Procter & Gamble to drive sales by inducing fears of social consequences associated with the condition that the product claims to address. In the 2000s, however, sales of the product dropped off, a phenomenon blamed on overextension of the brand into too many varieties, with over thirty kinds of Head & Shoulders being sold.The active ingredients in Head & Shoulders are the antifungal agents selenium disulfide and piroctone olamine.

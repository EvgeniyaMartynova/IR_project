Title: Peltaria
Aspects: {'P. emarginata'}

Peltaria is a genus of flowering plants, within the family Brassicaceae. Their distribution ranges from Southeast Europe, Near East to Central Asia. They prefer rocky slopes.
Peltraria species are perennials with white or rosa flowers. They are glabrous with sessile, entire and simple leaves. Their siliculae are pendent, very flat, on a short decent style.

According to Warwick, Francis and Al-Shehbaz and Kubitzki this genus comprises four species, two of which occur in Europe.
SpeciesPeltaria alliacea Jacq. from Southeast Austria to Romania and Albania, chromosome number 2n=14 (28,56).
Peltaria angustifolia DC. in the Near East (Israel: Golan, Hermon mountains; Jordan, Iraq, Iran). Further photos in the flora of Israel. Chromosome number 2n=14.
Peltaria emarginata (Boiss.) Hausskn. (Syn.: Leptoplax emarginata (Boiss.) O.E.Schulz) endemic to Greece. This plant accumulates nickel in its leaves.
Peltaria turkmena Lipsky in Central Asia. Photo, map. Chromosome number 2n=14.

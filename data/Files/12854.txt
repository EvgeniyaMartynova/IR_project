Title: Sason robustum
Aspects: {'S. robustum'}

Sason robustum is a species of barychelid trapdoor spiders. It is only found in southern India, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles.
Males are about 9 mm long, females almost 11 mm.


== Distinguishing features ==
Sason robustum is characterized by absence of teeth on the claws; cuspules present on
maxillae and labium; rastellum absent; the apex of the first tibia
with a single stout prolateral spine; and the palpal bulb spherical
with a tapering embolus.


== Taxonomy ==
Sason robustum was first described by Octavius Pickard-Cambridge in 1883. He placed it in a new genus Sarpedon. However this name had already been used for a beetle, so in 1887, Eug√®ne Simon put forward the replacement genus name, Sason.

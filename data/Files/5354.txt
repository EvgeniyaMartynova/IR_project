Title: Honda H Engine
Aspects: {'H22'}

The Honda H engine was Honda's Larger high-performance engine family from the 1990s and early 2000s. It is largely derived from the Honda F engine with which it shares many design features. Like Honda's other 4-cylinder families of the 80s and 90s, It has also enjoyed some success as a racing engine, forming the basis of Honda's Touring car racing engines for many years, and being installed in lightweight chassis (such as the Honda CR-X) for use in drag racing. The F20B is a part of the F-series family of engines; it is basically a cast iron sleeved down destroked version of the H22A. It was developed by Honda to be able to enter into the 2-liter class of international racing.
H-Series consisted of two different displacements; H22 2.2 L (2,157 cc) and H23 2.3 L (2,259 cc). Both versions were using the same short block; different crankshafts and connecting rods were utilized to achieve displacement variation.

=== H22 ===
The H22 debuted in the U.S. in 1993 as the H22A1 for use in the Honda Prelude VTEC. Since then, versions of the H22 would become the Prelude's signature high-performance engine worldwide until the end of Prelude production in 2001.In 1994, Honda of Europe used the H22A cylinder head and the H22A engine block as the Formula 3 engine which was an H22A engine destroked from 2.2 liters to 2.0 liters (F3-2000cc) to compete in the European F3 series. It was then used by Mugen Motorsports as the F20B(MF204B) from 1997-2001. In 1995-1997, Honda of Europe used the same H22A-based F3 engine in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) Honda Accord. Also, in 1996-1997 Honda of Japan used the same H22A-based F3 engine in the Japan Touring Car Championship (JTCC) Honda Accord and won the JTCC for both years. Honda of Europe hired Neil Brown Engineering of England to convert the H22A engine into an F3 engine which would be later used in BTCC and JTCC.

==== H23A DOHC VTEC ====
In 1998, Honda of Japan produced a rare DOHC VTEC version of the H23A engine for use in Japan only. It has been factory modified with an internal oil passage in the H23A block to operate the VTEC solenoid in the H22A head. It has the same horsepower rating as the H22A engine but a lower redline of 7200rpms  because it has a longer stroke than the H22A. The H23A DOHC VTEC has 87 mm × 95 mm (3.43 in × 3.74 in) (bore and stroke) and the H22A DOHC VTEC has 87 mm × 90.7 mm (3.43 in × 3.57 in) (bore and stroke). The H23A DOHC VTEC Engine is largest displacement in the H Series engines with a compression ratio of 10.6:1.

Found in the Japanese 1998-2002 Accord Wagon SiR (CH9). It produces 200 PS (147 kW; 197 hp) @ 6,800 rpm & 163 lb⋅ft (221 N⋅m) @ 5,300 rpm and comes with a "blue top".
Found in the Japanese 1998-2002 Accord Wagon AWD (CL2). It produces 190 PS (140 kW; 187 hp) @ 6,800 rpm & 163 lb⋅ft (221 N⋅m) @ 5,300 rpm and comes with a "blue top".Below is a chart that consists all of the engines in the H / F Series.

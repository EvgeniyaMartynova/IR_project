Built in 1966, Case was named for Jerome Increase Case, founder of Racine Threshing Works, now a part of CNH Global. Case students are divided into three academies: Business, Health Sciences, and Computer Science Education and Technical Services. The school mascot is "Casey the Eagle". The school is the first of ten authorized Wisconsin high schools to offer the International Baccalaureate program. After a recent application process in May 2015, Case earned the approval from IBO to become an IB Career Programme Candidate school. This will mark the fourth programme of the Racine Unified IB continuum.
Case is an Academy of Racine, which is a program released by RUSD with hopes to give students the opportunity to become "College or career ready".

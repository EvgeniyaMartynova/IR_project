Aspects: {'M. tinctoria'}

Maclura tinctoria, commonly known as old fustic or dyer's mulberry  is a medium to large tree of the Neotropics, from Mexico to Argentina. It produces a yellow dye called fustic  primarily known for coloring khaki fabric for U.S. military apparel during World War I. This dye contains the flavonoid morin.The leaves can be used to feed silk worms.Old fustic is not to be confused with young fustic (Rhus cotinus) from southern Europe and Asia, which provides a more fugitive colour.

Fustic is a bright yellow dye that is very color-fast when used with mordants. It is frequently combined with other dyestuffs and various mordants to produce a range of yellow and greenish colors:
With woad or indigo: bright or Saxon greens

Title: IWI Tavor X95
Aspects: {'X95'}

The IWI Tavor X95 (also called Micro-Tavor, MTAR, and MTAR-21) is an Israeli bullpup assault rifle designed and produced by Israel Weapon Industries (IWI) as part of the Tavor rifle family, along with the TAR-21 and the Tavor 7.
In November 2009 the Tavor X95 was selected as the future standard issued weapon of the Israeli infantry.


== Design ==

The Tavor X95 can be easily distinguished from the TAR-21 (as well as from CTAR-21, STAR-21, and GTAR-21) by the location of the cocking handle. An X95 cocking handle is closer to the pistol grip, while a TAR-21 cocking handle is closer to the muzzle. The stock was also slightly redesigned.With the use of a relatively simple conversion kit, the Tavor X95 can be converted from a 5.56 mm assault rifle to a 9 mm submachine gun. A suppressor can also be added to the weapon, as part of the 9 mm conversion kit, or as part of a replacement hand guard which integrates muzzle brake, suppressor, and hand guard. The Tavor X95 also has its own underslung grenade launcher, the X95 GL 40. A discontinued production model of the X95 the X95-GL had the capability to mount a M203 grenade launcher on an extended notched barrel.When configured to fire 9 mm rounds, the gun uses a blowback operation to eject and reload rounds, but in the same body as the gas-operated rifle reloading system.  It is fed from Uzi magazines.  A suppressor can be mounted that allows for the use of standard velocity 9 mm ammunition, not specialized subsonic ammo.  The barrel is the same length as the rifle version, but has a 1:10 in rifling twist to stabilize heavy 9 mm bullets.Compared to the 890 mm (35 in) long M4 carbine (with its stock extended) with a 370 mm (14.6 in) barrel, the X95 is 580 mm (22.8 in),  640 mm (25.2 in), or 670 mm (26.4 in) long, with either a 330 mm (13 in.), 380 mm (15.0 in), or a 419 mm (16.5 in) barrel, respectively.


== Variants ==

There are three different handguards currently available for the Tavor X95: the first is rounded (so that one can mount a suppressor and have the suppressor sit inside of the handguard) and is currently only available for military issue; the second is a rectangular one with integrated rails at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, and has removable rail covers; and the third is an elongated version of the second, made for IWI US X95s. The rounded handguard originally had separate picatinny rails on the receiver and handguard, but IWI has produced a full length flattop rail and an underside rail for it; the other two handguards have integrated flattop rails.
The Tavor X95 comes with the option of changing out the pistol grip with either the standard Tavor Talon trigger guard, a traditional trigger guard, or any compatible third-party accessory.
The Tavor X95 comes in a number of variants (including):

 Israel: In November 2009, the IDF announced that the Tavor X95 would become the standard infantry weapon of the IDF, with the addition of an integrated grenade-launcher. In 2014 the IDF announced that in the future (from as early as the end of 2014) some infantry units could start to be issued some numbers of an improved X95, which will have a longer 380 mm (15.0 in) barrel, instead of the original 330 mm (13.0 in) barrel of the X95, and a lighter trigger pull.
 India: India's Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) ordered 12,000 Tavor X95 rifles which entered service in early 2011. Following the use of the weapon by Indian forces fighting the insurgency in Kashmir, CRPF commanders have stated that the X95 is a more effective assault rifle than the AKM, due to its small size, power, longer range and lighter weight. In late 2002, India signed an ₹880 million (equivalent to ₹2.5 billion or US$36 million in 2018) deal with Israel Military Industries for 3,070 manufactured TAR-21s to be issued to India's special forces personnel, where its ergonomics, reliability in heat and sand might give them an edge at close-quarters and employment from inside vehicles. By 2005, IMI had supplied 350–400 TAR-21s to India's northern Special Frontier Force (SFF). These were subsequently declared to be "operationally unsatisfactory". The required changes have since been made, and tests in Israel during 2006 went well, clearing the contracted consignment for delivery. The TAR-21 has now entered operational service – even as India gears up for a larger competition that could feature a 9 mm X95 version. Known as the Zittara, the rifle is manufactured in India by the Ordnance Factories Board for Indian service, although it was never adopted. the new Tavor X95s have a modified single-piece stock and new sights, as well as Turkish-made MKEK T-40 40 mm under-barrel grenade launchers. 5,500 have been recently inducted and more rifles are being ordered. A consignment of over 500 Tavor bullpup assault rifles and another 30 Galil sniper rifles worth over ₹150 million (US$2.2 million) and ₹20 million (US$290,000) respectively was delivered to the MARCOS (Marine Commandos) in December 2010. In 2016, IWI announced that it was establishing a 49:51 joint venture with Punj Lloyd in India, in order manufacture rifle components in India.

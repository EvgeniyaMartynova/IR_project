Title: Zabana language
Aspects: {'Zabana'}

Zabana is an Oceanic language spoken almost exclusively in the Kia district on the northern part of Santa Isabel Island in the Solomon Islands. Zabana is considered a developing language (EGIDS 5) which means that the language is in vigorous use, with literature in a standardized form being used by some though this is not yet widespread or sustainable. It is one of the most spoken languages on Santa Isabel Island, competing with Cheke Holo. There is a 30% to 60% literacy rate in Zabana as a first language and a 25% to 50% literacy rate in Zabana as a second language.  


== Location ==
Zabana is almost exclusively spoken on Santa Isabel Island which is the largest island in the Isabel provenience and the third largest island in the Solomon Island chain. Zabana is one of the eight different languages spoken on Santa Isabel island. Out of the other seven different languages spoken on the island, Zabana shares major similarities with Kokota and Cheke Holo (also known as Maringe.) A combination dialect of Zabana and Cheke Holo is also developed and widely spoken within the area.


== Phonology ==
Zabana only contains open syllables, since there are no consonant clusters and geminate vowels in the language. It is important to note that vocal stress on a single phoneme does not exist in Zabana, instead certain syllables called penultimate syllables (the final syllable of a word that ends in a vowel) are stressed. When compared to the neighboring languages, it is also important to note that Zabana has fewer phonemes than its neighbors, in particular Kokota.


== Morphology ==
There are two types of verbs in Zabana, transitive and intransitive verbs.
Transitive Verb: Can be attached with a suffix which indexes the direct or indirect object.
Intransitive Verb: Verbs which convey motion of some sort.In Zabana, possession is denoted syntactically by a possessive suffix attached to the noun such as no or ka. It is important to note that words such as "father", "mother", and "uncle" can never take on a possessive suffix.
Larger numbers are made by compounding "Cardinal Numbers" such as one through ten and the exponential factors of ten such as one hundred and one thousand.
Reduplication is used in Zabana to derive intransitive verbs from transitive terms and to derive nouns from verbs.

The exception of this rule is the connecting particle ghe which is used to denote a conditional sentence or question and nia must be used to connect the pronoun and the proper noun together. ghe can also be used in a complex sentence to link together two different proper nouns.

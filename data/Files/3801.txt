Title: Hirth F-33
Aspects: {'F33'}

The Hirth F-33 is a single cylinder, two stroke, carburetted aircraft engine designed for use on ultralight aircraft, including powered paragliders and ultralight trikes. It is noted for its extremely light base weight of 35 lb (16 kg).


== Development ==
The F-33 was intended to fill the niche previously occupied by the now out-of-production 28 hp (21 kW) Rotax 277. The F-33 uses free air cooling, dual capacitor discharge ignition and reed valve induction, with a single Bing 34mm slide or optional diaphragm type carburetor. The cylinder walls are electrochemically coated with Nikasil. Standard starting is recoil start. A belt reduction drive system, fuel injection, tuned exhaust and electric start are optional.The engine runs on a 50:1 pre-mix of unleaded 93 octane auto fuel and oil. Recommended time between overhauls is 1000 hours.The F-33 produces 22 hp (16 kW) at 5200 rpm and 28 hp (21 kW) at 6500 rpm.

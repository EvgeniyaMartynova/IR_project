== Features ==
The Pentax K-7 was announced on 20 May 2009 and shipping began as of the first week of July 2009. The K-7 has the same pixel count as its predecessor, the K20D, but offers a significantly expanded feature set in a smaller body. New features include:
body is still weather resistant like the K20D; however, it is now made of magnesium alloy, and it is now also low temperature resistant
a high-definition video recording function (30 frames per second at 1536×1024 resolution or HDTV (cropped))
TAv exposure mode: Time/Aperture Value: photographer sets his own desired shutter speed/aperture, while the camera adjusts the ISO accordingly to compensate exposure
in-camera high dynamic range imaging function to create one composite image from three images with different exposures
dedicated AF-assist lamp
in-camera electronic level that works with Earth's gravity, usable in total darkness too (a 1st by Pentax in any camera model from any brand)

== History ==
The station was originally launched in 1948 as 94.1 CHML-FM, a simulcast of AM station CHML. The simulcast was subsequently dropped in the 1950s, leaving the station silent. The owners relaunched the FM signal on the 95.3 frequency in 1964, with distinct programming from its AM sister station. In 1967, the station adopted the new callsign CKDS-FM, in honour of company founder Kenneth D. Soble, who had died in 1966.
In 1974, CHML and CKDS-FM were purchased by ML Radio, a division of what was to become Western International Communications. On September 1, 1991, CKDS-FM dropped its long-time adult contemporary/easy listening format, and adopted the CJXY callsign and a classic rock format as Y95.
In 2000, CHML and CJXY were acquired by Corus Entertainment. On August 31, 2001, CJXY swapped frequencies with Corus' CING, taking over CING's former 107.9 frequency; at the same time, it changed its moniker to the current Y108.
Y108 had old-time CFNY-FM host Alan Cross as program director until 2004, when he returned to CFNY. Tammy Cole is currently CJXY's program director. Recently, CJXY has changed to a more active rock format under the slogan World Class Rock, with a substantial increase in current music in its playlist.

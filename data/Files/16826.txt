Title: Zbrojovka Z 5 Express
Aspects: {'Z5'}

The Zbrojovka Z 5 Express was a car produced by Československá Zbrojovka in the 1930s.


== Design ==
In 1933, Zbrojovka tested a prototype four-cylinder car as a larger and more luxurious follow-on to the Z 4. The production car used a two stroke four cylinder 1,470 cc (90 in3) engine with a bore of 90 mm (3 1⁄2 in) and stroke of 77 mm (3 in). Drum brakes were fitted front and rear, and suspension was by half axles supported by leaf springs. It was produced in a number of body styles, including a two-door sedan which cost 37,500 Kčs and a two-seat sports car that cost over 50,000 Kčs.


== Performance ==
The Z 5 Express could reach a top speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) and had a typical fuel consumption of between 11 and 13 l/100 km (26 and 22 mpg‑imp; 21 and 18 mpg‑US).


== Production ==
The car was announced in October 1935 at the Prague Motor Show and sales continued after the factory moved to military production from 1936, the last car being sold in 1938. 357 vehicles were manufactured.


== Notable examples ==
Carol II of Romania used an example with a body designed by Plachý.
The National Technical Museum (Prague) has preserved the vehicle used by Alois Eliáš, Prime Minister of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

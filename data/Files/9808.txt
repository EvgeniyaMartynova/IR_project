Title: Otoyol 3
Aspects: {'O3'}

Otoyol 3 (English: Motorway 3), also known as the European Motorway (Turkish: Avrupa Otoyolu) and abbreviated as the O-3 is a 245.1 km (152.3 mi) long otoyol in East Thrace, Turkey. The O-3 runs from Edirne to Istanbul and is the only motorway in Turkey located entirely in Europe. The motorway begins west of Edirne at a junction with the D-100 where it then continues as a beltway passing just north of Edirne. From there, the motorway passes though mostly rural farmland until it enters the Istanbul metropolis near Silivri. The eastern end of the O-3 is at the interchange with the O-1, where the motorway becomes Vatan Caddesi and continues into the historic peninsula of Istanbul as a major boulevard. 
The O-3 connects with three other motorways, all in Istanbul; the O-1, O-2 and the O-7; and is a part of the  E80, the International E-road network and  of the Asian Highway Network. The motorway has six lanes, three in each direction, except for a 44.6 km (27.7 mi) section between Silivri and Esenyurt.

Title: K-31 (Kansas highway)
Aspects: {'K31 (disambiguation)'}

K-31 is a 134-mile (216 km) long state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas. Signed variously as a north–south and an east–west highway, K-31 runs diagonally southeast–northwest, connecting small towns in east-central Kansas.


== Route description ==

K-31 begins at a diamond interchange with U.S. Highway 69 (US-69) near Fulton in Bourbon County and heads west on a two-lane road to Mapleton. The highway turns north for six miles (9.7 km), then turns west again at a junction with K-52. Seven miles (11 km) west of this point, K-31 enters the town of Kincaid, where it begins an 18-mile (29 km) concurrency with US-59, and also overlaps US-169 south of Garnett. In Garnett, K-31 leaves US-59 to the west and heads towards Harris where it turns north, again.  It turns west at the Franklin County line and overlaps the border until it enters Coffey County, where it continues west toward Waverly.  Leaving the town, K-31 heads north again toward Interstate 35 (I-35), and Melvern.  It shares a short wrong-way concurrency with I-35 before arriving in Melvern, where it once again turns west. The highway begins a nine-mile (14 km) concurrency with US-75, where it heads toward, and passes through Lyndon.  North of the city, K-31 again turns west toward Osage City.  It begins a seven-mile (11 km) concurrency with US-56 north of the town and travels north to Burlingame, where it leaves US-56 and heads west toward Harveyville.  After passing through Harveyville, K-31 terminates at K-99 in rural Wabaunsee County.


== History ==
The majority K-31 has followed the same route since its creation.  Minor adjustments were made when I-35 was built, and K-31 was rerouted through Melvern.

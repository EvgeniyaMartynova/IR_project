Title: Deckenia nobilis
Aspects: {'D. nobilis'}

Deckenia nobilis, the cabbage palm or millionaire's salad, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is monotypic within the genus Deckenia, and is endemic to the Seychelles, where it is threatened by habitat loss. It was described in 1870.It is a palm tree, growing to a height of 40 meters. In the wild, it is found intermittently in lowland forests, at elevations up to 600 metres. It is in decline due to unregulated or illegal over-harvesting of the edible palm hearts, but certain stands growing on rocky crags and outcrops are very difficult for humans to reach, which tentatively affords them natural protection. Also, some new growth is attributable to tree nurseries on the Seychelles, which raise D. nobilis seedlings and distribute them to the local populace for planting.

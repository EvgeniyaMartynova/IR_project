Title: Puerto Rican bullfinch
Aspects: {'L. portoricensis'}

The Puerto Rican bullfinch (Loxigilla portoricensis) or comeñame in Spanish, is a small bullfinch tanager endemic to the archipelago of Puerto Rico and one of three species belonging to the genus Loxigilla. These were previously considered Emberizidae.

The Puerto Rican bullfinch has black feathers with red areas above the eyes, around its throat, and underneath the tail's base. The species measures from 17 to 19 cm and weighs approximately 32 grams.
The species can be commonly found in heavy forests throughout Puerto Rico, except on the easternmost tip of the island. It consumes seeds, fruits, insects, and spiders. The nest is spherical, with an entrance on the side. Typically three light green eggs are laid.
A subspecies, Loxigilla portoricensis grandis, endemic to St. Kitts and Barbuda was last collected in 1929 and is considered extinct.

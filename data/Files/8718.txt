Title: Magnolia salicifolia
Aspects: {'M. salicifolia'}

Magnolia salicifolia, also known as willow-leafed magnolia or anise magnolia, originates from Japan.  It is a small deciduous tree 7.5 m (25 ft) tall, with narrow lanceolate leaves with  whitened undersides. The leaves are not as narrow as true willows (Salix), but is narrow compared to other magnolias, giving this tree a finer texture. The 10 cm-wide scented flowers emerge in early spring before the leaves. The leaves and bark are fragrant when crushed.
The cultivar 'Wada's Memory', with double white scented flowers, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

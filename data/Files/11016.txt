Title: Al Imran
Aspects: {'Q3'}

Āl ʿImrān  (Arabic: آل عمران‎, "The Family of Imran") is the third chapter (surah) of the Quran with two hundred verses (ayat). 


== Context ==
Imran in Islam is regarded as the father of Mary (mother of Jesus). This chapter is named after the family of Imran, which includes Imran, Saint Anne, Mary, and Jesus. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (Asbāb al-nuzūl),  the chapter is believed to have been either the second or third of the Medinan surahs, as it references both the events of Badr and the Uhud. Almost all of it also belongs to the third year of the Hijra, though a minority of its verses might have been revealed during the visit of the Najrān Christian deputation and the Mubahala, which occurred around the 10th year of the Hijrah. This chapter primarily focuses on the departure of prophethood from the Mosaic dispensation.
According to Christian tradition, Joachim is the husband of Saint Anne and the father of Mary, the mother of Jesus. The chapter takes its name from the family of Imran mentioned in verse (ayah) 33.According to Iraqi scholar and translator, N.J. Dawood, the Quran confuses Mary mother of Jesus with Mary the sister of Moses, by referring to Mary, the mother of Jesus' father as Imran, which is the Arabic version of Amram, who in Exodus 6:20, is shown to be the father of Moses. Dawood, in a note to Surah 19:28, where Mary the Mother of Jesus is referred to as the "Sister of Aaron", and Aaron was the brother of Mary sister of Moses, states: "It Appears that Miriam, Aaron's sister, and Maryam (Mary), mother of Jesus, were according to the Koran, one and the same person."

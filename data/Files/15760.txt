Title: Toshiba Qosmio
Aspects: {'X300'}

The Qosmio series (dynabook Qosmio in Japan) was Toshiba's consumer-marketed line of high performance desktop replacement laptops. The laptop was first released on July 25, 2004 as the E15-AV101 with a 1.7 GHz Intel Pentium M CPU, 512 megabytes of DDR SDRAM, and a 15-inch XGA 1,024 by 768 screen. Toshiba's most powerful laptop has undergone many revisions, with focus shifting from high-end multimedia functionality to heavy gaming. The current line, the X70 series, was released in 2013, featuring an Intel Core i7 processor with up to 32 gigabytes of DDR3 SDRAM and an nVidia Geforce GTX 770M as well as a 17.3 inch Full HD display.


== History ==
The Toshiba Qosmio G35-AV650 is the first production notebook made available with an HD DVD-compatible drive. The Qosmio G35 line also functioned as a Digital Video Recorder as it contains an integrated TV tuner.Focus for the Qosmio has shifted from full-fledged multimedia to high end gaming with high quality graphics and audio. This can be seen in the first Qosmio, the E15-AV101, which offered a 1.7 GHz Intel Pentium M 735 CPU, 512 megabytes of DDR SDRAM, a 15-inch XGA 1,024 by 768 screen, and an nVidia GeForce FX Go5200 with 64 MB of dedicated DDR video memory, all of which were relatively powerful for the time. The X500 has an Intel Core i7 processor with up to 6 gigabytes of DDR3 SDRAM as well as an 18.4 inch HD display powered by an nVidia Geforce GTX 460M with 1.5 GB GDDR5. These components, on the other hand, are on the high end of the spectrum in performance.  This original model launched in 2004 with an international marketing campaign. The campaign was featured in every major publication, as well as an ambitious digital campaign, one of the first for a major laptop release at that time.

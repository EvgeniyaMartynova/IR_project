There are three generations per year in northern Guangdong.
The larvae have been recorded feeding on Meliosma rigida. They are bright yellowish green above the spiracles, with yellow tubercles. Below the spiracles, the body is watery green with white tubercles, separated from the dorsal part by a bright yellow subspiracular stripe that is edged ventrally by brown, most intense on the thorax, weak or absent over the abdominal segments. The oblique bands are formed by yellow or red tubercles. The horn is bright green.

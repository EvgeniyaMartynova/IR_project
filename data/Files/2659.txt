Title: Pennsylvania Railroad class D14
Aspects: {'D14'}

Class D14 on the Pennsylvania Railroad was a type of steam locomotive with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement in the Whyte notation.
They were originally designated class P in the PRR's pre-1895 classification scheme.  Twenty-two locomotives were built at the PRR's Altoona Works (now owned by Norfolk Southern); six in 1893 with 78-inch (1,981 mm) driving wheels, and sixteen in 1894 with 80-inch (2,032 mm) drivers, classified D14a.
Later, all sixteen class D14a were rebuilt to class D14b with 68-inch (1,727 mm) drivers for secondary service after they were replaced in top-flight express service, while three of the six class D14 were similarly rebuilt to class D14c.

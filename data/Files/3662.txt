Title: Bråvalla Air Force Wing
Aspects: {'F13'}

Bråvalla Air Force Wing (Swedish: Bråvalla flygflottilj), also F 13 Norrköping, or simply F 13, is a former Swedish Air Force wing with the main base located near Norrköping in south-eastern Sweden.


== History ==
The Air Wing was established in 1943 as the fourth fighter wing, and the thirteenth wing in total, in the Swedish Air Force.
The location had been mapped out in 1941 and consisted of purchased land from Sörby, Knivberga and Ringstad farmsteads. In 1942, preparation work on the almost square 1000 m by 1000 m grass air field was started and completed in September 1943. The main administration was housed inside Norrköping main hotel until the first office buildings were completed in 1945. The wing was given the name Bråvalla as a tie to the  Battle of Bråvalla in 770.
The first fighter squadrons were set up by the Italian built J 11 in 1943 which was quickly replaced by the Swedish built J 22 in 1944.
In 1946, F 13 became the first wing in the Swedish Air Force to convert to jets with the J 28. It was later also first wing to introduce J 29 and J 35 in service in 1951 and 1960 respectively.
In 1976 a new reconnaissance squadron was set up with a combined SF/SH 37 fleet and in 1980, F 13 was yet again the first wing to receive the JA 37.
On June 3, 1992 the decision was made to decommission the squadrons on June 30, 1993 and the remaining wing administration on June 30, 1994.


== F 13 today ==
The airfield is today known as Norrköping-Bråvalla airfield (ICAO: ESCK). It is currently administered by Blekinge Air Force Wing (F 17) and is mainly used as a storage facility for obsolete equipment. The underground facility called Berget (The mountain) is still being maintained and could hold a number of fighters. One of the runways is still operational and can be reactivated.


== Commanding officers ==
From 1943 to 1977, the commanding officers was referred to as flottiljchef ("wing commander") and had the rank of lieutenant colonel. From 1951, the wing commander at F 13 received the rank of colonel. From 1977 to 1981, the wing commander was referred to as sektorflottiljchef ("sector wing commander") and had the rank of colonel 1st class. From 1981 to 1994, the commanding officer was again referred to as flottiljchef ("wing commander"), and had from 1991 the rank of colonel.

För att avlasta sektorflottiljchefen tillfördes 1977 en ställföreträdande sektorflottiljchef. Dennes uppgift var att leda förbandsproduktionen, en uppgift i stort lika med den gamle flottiljchefens. Därav titulerades även han som "flottiljchef". Den ställföreträdande sektorflottiljchefen hade graden överste. Den 30 juni 1981 utgick befattningen ställföreträdande sektorflottiljchef.

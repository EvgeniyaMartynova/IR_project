Title: Caudron R.6
Aspects: {'R6'}

The Caudron R.6 was a French reconnaissance aircraft of World War I.  It was a scaled-down version of the Caudron R.4.  It eliminated the R.4's nose-gunner and used smaller engines (Le Rhônes  of 82 kW).  Some 750 of these aircraft were built, three times the production of the original R.4 design.

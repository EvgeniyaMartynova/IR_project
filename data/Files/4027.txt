Title: Farman F.170 Jabiru
Aspects: {'F170'}

The Farman F.170 Jabiru was a 1925 single-engine airliner evolved from the F.121 Jabiru, built by the Farman Aviation Works.


== Design and development ==
The F.170 Jabiru was a single-engine evolution of the 1923 F.3X/F.121. In the early 1920s, there was a strong prejudice in favour of single-engine airliners. Since even multi-engine aircraft could not keep flying in the likely event that an engine went out, it was considered that a single engine offered just as much security and a greater ease of maintenance.
The F.170 could carry up to 8 passengers and was an ungainly sesquiplane with a rectangular upper wing of constant profile. Its construction was of traditional wood and fabric. Since the aircraft was quite low on its wheels, it was often derisively called the ventre-à-terre (belly to the ground). The first flight took place in 1925.
The improved F.170bis, introduced in 1927, incorporated some metal construction and could carry 9 passengers. The F.171bis was joined by the one and only F.171.


== Variants ==
F.170
An 8-passenger seaquiplane powered by a 370 kW (500 hp) Farman 12 We engine, 13 built.
F.170bis
9-passenger airliner; an F.170 incorporating some metal construction, four built.
F.171
A long-range derivative developed for a crossing of the North Atlantic, one built.


== Operational history ==
The F.170 and F.170bis were used exclusively by Société Générale des Transports Aériens (SGTA) from May 1926 and used on the Paris-Cologne-Berlin route. When the SGTA was incorporated in the newly created Air France airline on 7 October 1933, some five F.170 were still being used.

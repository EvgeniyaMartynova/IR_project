Title: California County Routes in zone J
Aspects: {'J3'}

There are 45 routes assigned to the "J" zone of the California Route Marker Program, which designates county routes in California. The "J" zone includes county highways in Alameda, Calaveras, Contra Costa, Fresno, Kern, Inyo, Mariposa, Merced, Sacramento, San Benito, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare counties.


== J1 ==
County Route J1 is a county road in San Benito and Fresno counties.  The route begins in Paicines, San Benito County, at State Route 25.  Between Paicines and Panoche Valley, J1 is known as Panoche Road.  Its north–south portion between Panoche Valley and Fresno County is called Little Panoche Road. In Fresno County, the route then intersects with Interstate 5 and terminates in Mendota at State Route 33 near State Route 180 in the Central Valley. East of Interstate 5, the alignment of J1 follows Fresno County's West Shields Avenue (which is Exit 379 off of Interstate 5). Shields Avenue ends at North Fairfax Avenue. J1 continues south 2 miles (3.2 km) on Fairfax Avenue to West Belmont Avenue, at which location J1 proceeds east on Belmont Avenue until its end at State Routes 33 and 180.
Panoche Road lies within the corridor of an unbuilt Route 180 segment. No current plan exists to extend Route 180 westward from Mendota past Interstate 5 and into San Benito County.Parts of J1 just west of I-5 are gravel rather than paved.

		


== J2 ==
County Route J2 is a series of streets and roads in the California counties of Alameda and San Joaquin.
J2 begins at Interstate 580's interchange with Portola Avenue in Livermore.  The route follows Portola to Livermore Avenue, where J2 turns southward to pass through Livermore's downtown.  The highway continues past the southeast edge of Livermore to become Tesla Road and rise into the Diablo Range, which separates the outer San Francisco Bay Area from the San Joaquin Valley.
At the Alameda-San Joaquin county line, J2 becomes Corral Hollow Road and enters the narrow valley of the same name.  Upon approaching the San Joaquin Valley, the road turns northward, meeting Interstate 580 again and arriving at the southern subdivisions of Tracy.  After passing through this city, the road intersects Interstate 205, shifts briefly onto Lammers Road, and soon turns northward onto Tracy Boulevard.  Here J2 crosses the sea-level Union and Roberts Islands in the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta before terminating at State Route 4.


== J3 ==
County Route J3 is a county road in central California that runs 35 miles (56 km) north-south through Stanislaus and San Joaquin Counties.
The route begins 2 miles (3.2 km) east of Vernalis as Kasson Road, running northward from the road's intersection with State Route 132.  After almost 3 miles (4.8 km) the route meets Airport Way and follows it northward 21 miles (34 km) past Manteca, Lathrop, and French Camp into Stockton.  J3 then follows West Lane 10 miles (16 km) out from Stockton and becomes Hutchins Street for the route's last 1 mile (1.6 km).  The route reaches its northern end at State Route 12 near Lodi.
The highway is also known as Stanislaus County Route J3 and San Joaquin County Route J3, though all but 1 mile (1.6 km) of the route is within San Joaquin County.


== J4 ==
County Route J4 is a county road in central California that runs 28 miles (45 km) nominally north–south across portions of San Joaquin County, Alameda County and Contra Costa County that are growing in population and suburbanization.  The highway connects the suburbs of the far outer East Bay and the Sacramento River Delta with the northern San Joaquin Valley.
The route begins 9 miles (14 km) southeast of Tracy at County Route J3, passes through Tracy and Byron, and terminates at State Route 4 between Discovery Bay and Brentwood.
The portion between Tracy and Brentwood lies along the unconstructed corridor of State Route 239.  SAFETEA-LU, federal legislation enacted in 2005, authorized $14 million in federal appropriations toward construction of the route.


== J5 ==
County Route J5 is a county road in San Joaquin County, California that runs for about 30 miles (49 km). It begins at State Route 99's interchange with Jack Tone Road in Ripon. Following Jack Tone Road, CR J5 passes through SR 120 east of Manteca and State Routes 4 and 26 east of Stockton. Eventually, it curves northwest where it is then co-routed with SR 88 at a right turn in Lockeford for a short distance before leaving SR 88 at a left turn at Elliot Road. It eventually leads to Peltier Road (CR J12), where CR J5 ends.


== J6 ==
County Road J6 is a county road in San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties. Its northern terminus is at Route 26 at Bellota, 4 miles east of Linden. South of Highway 26, it carries the name Escalon-Bellota Road, and runs due south, crossing Route 4 at Farmington. The route continues due south to a junction with Route 120 at Escalon, where it continues due south as McHenry Avenue before ending at a junction with Route 108 near Del Rio.


== J7 ==
County Route J7 mostly parallels State Route 99 to the east and generally follows the Santa Fe Railroad between Merced and Stockton. It also connects several smaller communities including Atwater, Winton, Cressey, Ballico, Denair, Hughson, Empire, Riverbank, Escalon and French Camp.
Route Description
The southern terminus for County Route J7 is at SR 59 in Merced, locally known as The Snelling Highway. The route is locally signed as Santa Fe Drive. From this point, it travels north for 12 mi through Merced County, passing by the former site of Castle Air Force Base in Atwater.  Upon crossing the Merced River, the route continues in Stanislaus County for another 20 mi until it reaches the community of Empire. In Empire, the route briefly co-signs with SR 132 (locally signed as Yosemite Boulevard) for just over 1 mi before turning onto Claus Road, where it skirts the eastern edge of Modesto. The route follows Claus Road for approximately 6.5 mi, passing the former site of the Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant as well as the Rainbow Fields sports park.
County Route J7 then follows locally signed Patterson Road in Riverbank for approximately 0.9 mi before turning onto First Street. Once on First Street, the route intersects with SR 108 (locally signed as Atchison Street) then continues on a north-south trajectory.  Once it crosses the Stanislaus River and enters San Joaquin County, the route is locally signed as Santa Fe Road. At this point, it continues its parallel path with the BNSF rail line. About 4.3 mi after entering San Joaquin County, the route then enters Escalon and becomes Main Street for 0.7 mi before reaching SR 120. CR J7 very briefly co-signs with SR 120 before intersecting with CR J6.  The two county routes share the same roadway (locally signed as Escalon-Bellota Road) for 2 mi before CR J7 turns onto Lone Tree Road. It follows Lone Tree Road for 8 mi until the road terminates at French Camp Road. At this point, it also intersects with CR J5 (Jack Tone Road).
At this point, CR J7 follows French Camp Road, which parallels a railroad spur connecting BNSF with UPRR.  During the 9.5-mi length that the route co-signs with French Camp Road, it also intersects with SR 99 and CR J3 (Airport Way), passing near the Delicato Winery. The county route eventually meets its northern terminus with I-5 at the southern edge of Stockton.

North of Thornton, the route proceeds slightly away from I-5 until it parallels the Union Pacific Railroad and crosses the Cosumnes River into Sacramento County.  From here the route is known as Franklin Boulevard and proceeds north to the town of Franklin.  Northbound traffic must then turn east onto Bilby Road to cross the railroad, then turn north on Willard Parkway to rejoin Franklin Boulevard south of its junction with Elk Grove Boulevard (CR E12).

The route continues north through Elk Grove and parts of the city of Sacramento before its junction with SR 99 at Broadway in Sacramento.

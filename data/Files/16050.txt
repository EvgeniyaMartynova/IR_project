Title: NOS (software)
Aspects: {'Xedit'}

NOS (Network Operating System) is a discontinued operating system with time-sharing capabilities, written by Control Data Corporation in the 1970s.NOS ran on the 60-bit CDC 6000 series of mainframe computers and their successors. NOS replaced the earlier CDC Kronos operating system of the 1970s. NOS was intended to be the sole operating system for all CDC machines, a fact CDC promoted heavily. NOS was replaced with NOS/VE on the 64-bit Cyber-180 systems in the mid-1980s.
Version 1 of NOS continued to be updated until about 1981; NOS version 2 was released early 1982.

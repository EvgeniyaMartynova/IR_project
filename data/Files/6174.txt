== Rozalla version ==
In 1993 the Zambian-born singer Rozalla covered "I Love Music" on her album Look No Further. Her version of the song also appeared on the soundtrack to the film Carlito's Way. "I Love Music" was the first of a series of cover versions Rozalla was to record over the years. It was also her first "new" song to be released on Sony Records, as her earlier releases had all been first put out by British indie label Pulse 8.


=== Critical reception ===
The Gavin Report wrote about the song: "From the totally hot soundtrack of Carlito's Way, which features several retro classics, comes one of the best from the Gamble/Huff songbook. International sensation Rozalla and producer Jellybean extract every ounce of excitement out of this 1976 O'Jays hit."


=== Commercial performance ===
Rozalla's recording of "I Love Music" reached number 1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. It also dented the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 76 and got to number 18 on the UK Singles Chart in 1994, marking something of a comeback after various earlier singles had failed to crack the top 40 (this was still 5 places lower than the original version by The O'Jays had reached however). In Iceland the song peaked at number 5 and in Finland number 6.

Title: D48 motorway (Czech Republic)
Aspects: {'R48'}

D48 motorway (Czech: Dálnice D48), formerly Expressway R48 (Czech: Rychlostní silnice R48) is a highway in eastern Czech Republic. 
Expressway sections between Bělotín and few kilometres east of Nový Jičín were built in the 1970s and 1980s, but only as a four-lane main road, so they are too narrow to have expressway parameters. Reconstruction of these sections is planned. The total length of this section is 33 km. Besides these, there are also few kilometres of expressway in operation east of Frýdek-Místek, and there is also a bypass of Český Těšín to Poland. Complete route to border with Poland is expected to be built in 2010.
As of 2017 32 km (20 mi) of highway are in operation. Another 12 km (7.5 mi) long are under construction.

Aspects: {'E. lutea'}

Euproctis lutea is a species of moth of the family Erebidae. It is found in northern Australia (the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales) and New Guinea.
The wingspan is about 30 mm. The forewings are yellow with two faint zigzag lines. The hindwings are plain yellow.The larvae, also known as 'Itchy Grubs',  feed on Lycopersicum esculentum, Begonia species, Myosotis arvensis, Rosa odorata, Barringtonia acutangula and Planchonia careya. They are black and hairy, with a wide white line running along the length of the abdomen, and a wide white spot on the thorax. Full-grown larvae reach a length of about 15 mm, and their hairs can lead to intense itching after contact with human skin.  Pupation takes place in a sparse cocoon in a sheltered location away from the food plant.

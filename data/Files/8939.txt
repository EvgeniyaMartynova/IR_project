Aspects: {'N. californica'}

Notholaena californica is a species of fern known by the common name California cloak fern. It is native to southern California, Arizona, and adjacent northwestern Mexico, where it grows in dry and rocky conditions, often in desert and chaparral habitats.


== Description ==
The leaves are divided into often asymmetrical leaflets which are subdivided into lobed segments, the leaf measuring 3 to 20 centimeters in total length, not counting the long, brown petiole. It is hairless and lacks scales. The leaf is covered in grainy exudate known as farina.

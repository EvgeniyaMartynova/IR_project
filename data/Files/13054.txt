Title: Taiwanofungus camphoratus
Aspects: {'T. camphoratus'}

Taiwanofungus camphoratus, also known as stout camphor fungus (Chinese: 牛樟芝), is a species of fungus that is endemic to Taiwan, where it grows only on the endemic tree Cinnamomum kanehirae, causing a brown heart rot.  Synonyms include Antrodia camphorata and Ganoderma camphoratum.


== Traditional medicine ==
The fungus is well-known and highly valued as a medicinal mushroom in Taiwan where it is known as niu-chang, niu-chang-ku, or niu-chang-chih. It is commonly used as an anti-cancer, anti-itching, anti-allergy, anti-fatigue, and liver protective herb in Taiwanese traditional medicine. An extract was reported to slow the growth of human breast cancer cells. A water extract of mycelium grown in liquid culture has been reported to have antioxidant and anticancer properties in vitro.Recently, the 32.15 Mb genome containing 9,254 genes was sequenced.


== Chemical constituents ==
Antcin B, antrodioxolanone, antrocamphin B, antroquinonol, antrocamphins, zhankuic acids, and other antcins have been reported as constituents of Taiwanofungus camphoratus.


== Ecological concern ==
Because of its use as a medicinal mushroom, fruiting bodies of the fungus can fetch high prices. Good quality fruiting bodies were reported to cost as much as US$15,000/kg in 1997, before artificial cultivation methods were developed. Some have illegally farmed the fungus in the forests of Taiwan by hollowing out endangered stout camphor trees (Cinnamomum kanehirae  or niu zhang Chinese: 牛樟).  This despite the equal potency of T. camphotatus grown indoors.

== Route description ==
K-141 is a north–south route with a total length of 13.470 miles (21.678 km). The entire route travels primarily through rural grassland.
K-141 begins at a southern terminus with K-4 west of the town Marquette. From there, the highway heads north for about 2.25 miles (3.62 km) before turning north-northwest. After the turn, K-141 travels along the top of Kanopolis Dam. Immediately after crossing the dam, the highway turns northwest, travels a short distance, then gently curves back to a northerly direction. K-141 continues traveling in a northward direction until it is one mile (1.6 km) south of K-140, at which time it turns northeast, crosses railroad tracks, then turns back north to its northern terminus with K-140 northeast of the unincorporated community of Carneiro.From the southern terminus northward 5 miles (8.0 km) it is paved with full design bituminous pavement, the next 5 miles (8.0 km) is paved with partial design bituminous pavement and the final 3.470 miles (5.584 km) is paved with full design bituminous pavement. K-141 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. 2017 Annual average daily traffic (AADT) on K-141 ranged from 455 near the intersection of Avenue M to 520 slightly north of the southern terminus.


== History ==
On October 6, 1954 the Kansas State Highway Commission, now known as Kansas Department of Transportation, passed a resolution to make Kanopolis Lake Road a state highway as soon as Ellsworth County had brought it up to state highway standards. Then in an August 16, 1955 resolution it was designated K-141 as the county had finished required projects. On October 13, 1967 US-40 was rerouted to overlap the newly constructed section of I-70 from Dorrance to Salina. At that time K-141 was extended from its northern terminus eastward along old US-40 to Salina. This extension was breif because on November 27, 1968 old US-40 from Ellsworth eastward to Salina was designated K-140 and K-141 was truncated to end at the new K-140, its original northern terminus.

== History ==
Formed in 1993 in, N17 was one of the original crossover electronic/metal bands. Maintaining a sound of timeless music with their records, Trust No One and Defy Everything, the group stayed true to its run as a band. N17 combines aggressive sound-scapes with heavy guitar riffs, electronic elements and intensive drumming.
The band takes its name from the November 17, 1973, student uprising at Athens Polytechnic University. Twenty students were killed when Greek army tanks suppressed the protests, and the group was formed in part to retaliate against the ruling military junta.
N17 has played and toured with notable bands including Marilyn Manson, Misfits, Fear Factory, Front Line Assembly, Type O Negative, Sevendust and Ministry.

According to the band's official MySpace page, they announced that they were working on a third studio album and a DVD, due for release sometime in fall 2007. This post was later removed, and another post was said that they were disbanding because they were busy with other projects. Their final show was on November 17, 2007, although the band re-united for a show on November 14, 2009, and announced shows for 2010. In early 2011, for the first time since 2002, the band reunited for a four-song surprise reunion with original member Chris Cannella. On November 4, 2015, Chris Canella, Willie Askew, Jason Kowalski, damoN17, Byron Filson and Rudy T Reilly reunited again and performed at Club Red in Tempe, Arizona. Mark Keltner was in attendance but did not play.

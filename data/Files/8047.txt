Title: Pain aux raisins
Aspects: {"L'Escargot"}

Pain aux raisins (French pronunciation: ​[pɛ̃ o ʁɛ.zɛ̃]) or escargot (French pronunciation: ​[ɛs.kaʁ.ɡo]) is a spiral pastry often eaten for breakfast in France. Its names translate as raisin bread and snail, respectively. It is a member of the pâtisserie viennoise family of baked foods.
In France, it is typically a variant of the croissant or pain au chocolat, made with a leavened butter pastry with raisins added and shaped in a spiral with a crème pâtissière filling. However, in many areas of Northern Europe and North America, it is generally made with sweetened bread dough or brioche dough, rather than pastry. It is often consumed for breakfast as part of a Continental breakfast.

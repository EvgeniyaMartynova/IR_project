== History ==
WVAF's license was granted on December 24, 1963, but it did not signed on until February 1, 1965. V100 has broadcast the AC format for some time now, but was previously a rock station in 1977. It was also previously owned by Capital Broadcasting Corporation until it was sold to West Virginia Radio Corporation. In the late 1990s, V100 played songs from the 70s such as Elton John & Kiki Dee's "Don't Go Breaking My Heart", Eagles' "Hotel California", Bee Gees "Stayin' Alive" and many more. By 2013, V100 dropped all 70's songs from their playlist and started to focus on more of a hot AC format without the hard rock or rap. It averages two or three songs from the 80s an hour, with mostly 90s, 2000s and current hits. Today, V100 has added the Eagles song, Hotel California back into the playlist.
The All 80's Lunch with Steve Bishop is broadcast on weekdays at noon and plays music from 1980 to 1989. The John Tesh Radio Show is broadcast early Sunday mornings from 4 am to 9 am. Backtrax USA with Kidd Kelly (the 80's and 90's versions) is broadcast from 8 pm to midnight on Saturdays, and Tom Kent's radio program Lovin Life Livin The '80s from 7 pm to midnight on Sundays. On Sunday, the station broadcasts Sonrise from 9am to 11am.

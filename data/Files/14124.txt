Title: Tour First
Aspects: {'UAP'}

Tour First (previously known as Tour UAP between 1974–1998, and as Tour AXA between 1998–2007) is an office skyscraper in Courbevoie, in La Défense, the business district of the Paris metropolitan area.
The tower was built in 1974 by Bouygues for the UAP insurance company. The building was 159 m (522 ft) at that time. Its ground shape was in the form of a three-pointed star whose branches were separated each by a 120° angle. This particular shape was chosen to symbolize the merger of the three French insurance companies that were at the origin of UAP. The tower was renamed Tour AXA when UAP was bought by the AXA insurance company in 1996.
Large-scale renovation of the tower began in 2007 and was completed in 2011. The exterior appearance of the building was completely changed, with extra height added to the tower. The renovated tower, now known as Tour First, is 225 m (738 ft) at roof height, and 231 m (758 ft) including its spire, with a total floor space of 86,707 m2 (933,310 sq ft). It is currently the tallest skyscraper in France, only surpassed in height by the Eiffel Tower.
Another AXA tower exists in New York City, USA, which is 228.6 m (751 ft) tall; Tour AXA in Montreal, Quebec, Canada was completed in 1974 and is 104 m (341 ft).

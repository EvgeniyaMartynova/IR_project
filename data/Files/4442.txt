Title: Guiera
Aspects: {'G. senegalensis'}

Guiera is a flowering plant genus in the family Combretaceae. Guiera senegalensis is the only species in the genus, found in Tropical Africa in dry areas from Senegal to Sudan (requiring lots of sunlight and light dry soil). The plant produces the tannin 3,4,5-Tri-O-galloylquinic acid and several alkaloids of the harman family.


== Uses ==
The plant as a whole is often decorative, however the leaves are known as a medicinal 'cure-all' in Africa. It is known for helping coughs, being hypotensive, antidiarrhetic and anti-inflammatory. Its bark yields a marketable gum, branches for baskets, framework, and fences, roots for toothpicks, and smoke to repel flies.It is an indicator species of overgrazed land.


== Ecology ==
Guiera is a pioneer species, spread via animal dispersal and grows well in impoverished soil. 


== Hydraulic redistribution ==
Hydraulic redistribution (HR): When grown as a companion plant with millet water drawn up by Guiera senegalensis during the night is excreted by its roots and available to the millet, dramatically increasing its yield.

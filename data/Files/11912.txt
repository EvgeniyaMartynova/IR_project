Title: R142A (New York City Subway car)
Aspects: {'R8'}

The R142A, along with the R142, are the first and second part of the fourth generation of new technology cars (NTTs) for the A Division of the New York City Subway. These cars were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan. They replaced the Redbird trains, including the R26, R28, R29, R33, R33WF, R36, and R36WF.


== Description ==
The R142As are numbered 7591–7810. They were originally numbered 7211–7810 when built, but cars 7211–7590 were converted into R188s.The R142A contract was divided into three sub-orders: 400 main order cars (7211–7610), 120 option order cars (7611–7730), and eighty cars built under a supplemental contract (R142S) in 2003-2004 to supplement the R142As (7731–7810). Regardless of sub-order differences, all R142As are mechanically and physically identical to each other.Currently, all R142As are maintained at the Jerome Yard and assigned to the 4.


== Features ==
The R142As feature Bombardier MITRAC propulsion systems, electronic braking, automatic climate control, electronic strip maps, interior and exterior electronic displays, and an on-board intercom system. The R142 and the R142A were partly designed by Antenna Design.The R142As are divided up into five-car sets, in the A-B-B-B-A configuration, with the two A cars (cab cars) on the ends, and three B cars (non-cab cars) in the middle. Trains consist of two five-car sets coupled together, making up a ten-car train. Like all other A-Division cars, each car has three sets of doors per side. Like the R110As, the R142As feature wider doors than past A-Division equipment, with 54-inch side doors (about 9 inches narrower than the R110As' 63-inch doors, but 4 inches wider than the R62/As' 50-inch doors). All car ends have windows, allowing passengers to see through to the next car, except cab ends, where the cab walls prevent such visibility. The R142A car bodies are constructed from stainless steel.


=== Recorded Announcements ===
The R142As and R142s are the first New York City Subway cars to feature recorded announcements. All passenger cars built after the R142s also use this feature.
Current recorded announcements are by:

Jessica Ettinger, 1010 WINS Anchor: announcements for Lexington Avenue Line trains (4, 5, and 6)
Dianne Thompson: announcements for the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line trains (1, 2, and 3)
Charlie Pellett: announcements to warn passengers of the closing doors and transfer announcements at most stations; formerly provided safety and delay announcements (2002–2017)
Velina Mitchell: safety and delay announcements (2018–present)The first three people were news anchors with Bloomberg Radio at the time the announcements were recorded. Since then, Ettinger and Pellett have moved to 1010 WINS-AM and Sirius Satellite Radio, working with Howard Stern and his Howard 100 News team.


== History ==


=== Delivery ===
The first ten R142As, 7211–7220, were delivered on December 20, 1999. The cars entered regular service on the 6 on July 10, 2000 after several months of testing and the resolving of all issues. During delivery, there were minor issues reported with the R142s and the R142As.


=== Post-delivery ===
Cars 7211–7590 (a total of 380 cars) have been retrofitted with CBTC for Flushing Line CBTC service and were converted to R188s. Cars 7591–7810 (the remaining 220 cars) are still part of the R142A fleet and will be retrofitted with CBTC hardware in the future.From late 2017 to late 2018, the interiors of the electronic sign boxes on cars 7691-7692 were retrofitted with LCD screens, replacing the MTA Arts for Transit cards usually located there. Several R160s were previously retrofitted with this feature. The screens were similar to the interior LED screens on the R143s, except that the R142As' screens had the capabilities to display multiple colors instead of only red, orange, and green.In January 2019, the MTA proposed mid-life upgrades to several train subsystems in the R142 and R142A fleets. These included changes to the HVAC, propulsion, and door systems, based on installations of these systems in the R188 fleet. Upgrades also included conversion of the remaining R142A fleet to be compatible with communications-based train control, in conjunction with subway signal upgrades along the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.

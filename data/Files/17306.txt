== History ==


=== Prehispanic History ===
Researchers point to the Olmecs as the indigenous group that arrived in Zacualpan de Amilpas,  considered the first inhabitants in the pre-Classic period between the years 1000 and 900 BCE. The second group to arrive were the Toltecs. Shortly after that, groups of Chichimecas and Chalcas arrived, ęwho founded new colonies in Totolapan, Tepoztlán, Tlayacapan, and Zacualpan.


=== Conquest & Colonialsim ===
After the Spanish Conquest of 1521, Francisco de Solis obtained several villages, including Zacualpan de Amilpas, Huazulco, Temoac, and Tlacotepec. He planted orchards, cultivated wheat and corn, and had honeycombs.
The spiritual conquest of Zacualpan de Amilpas began in 1533 with the arrival of the provincial vicar, Fray Francisco de la Cruz, who ordered Jorge de Ávila and Jerónimo de San Esteban to went to evangelize the region. In 1535 the two brothers began construction of a temple and a convent to honor the Immaculate Conception of Mary next to the Amatzinac Canyon. The original building was small, but with time one of the best architects of the order of the Augustinians, Fray Juan de la Cruz, arrived, and the temple and convent were significantly improved.
In 1550, the viceroy exempted the inhabitants of Zacualpan de Amilpas taxes, which meant that the resources could be used to embellish the religious complex that was still being built. The Augustinians evangelized the region for 107 years. In 1786, José Gálvez, supported by King Carlos II, divided Nueva España (Mexico) into two comandancias or zones, besides establishing three governments and twelve intendencias.


=== 19th Century ===
The municipality originally belonged to the Intendencia de Puebla, but when the municipalities of Tlapa and Iguala were exchanged with the State of Mexico, the Alcaldía Mayor de Cuautla kept Zacualpan de Amilpas. The municipality was created in 1849 when Zacualpan refused subservience to Cuernavaca. In 1869, upon the creation of the State of Morelos, Zacualpan formed part of the District of Cuautla de Amilpas.


=== Revolution & the 20th Century ===
The Constitution of 1857 was designed to end the abuses of the Church and other large landowners, but it failed. During the Mexican Revolution, many men from Zacualpan joined the Zapatistas and supported the Plan de Ayala. Zapata defended education as it was designed by Antonio Díaz Soto y Gama, who ordered the establishment of schools in Tochimilco, Puebla, Jantetelco and Zacualpan de Amilpas. The temple and ex-convent were used as military barracks by federal troops as well as revolutionary ones.On December 17, 1937, the walls of the ex-convent in Zacualpan de Amilpas and elsewhere were cracked during an earthquake, convincing people that steps were needed to preserve historical monuments. A law was passed on June 9, 1939, that declared colonial convents national monuments and providing for their preservation.
Differences between Zacualpan and surrounding communities led to the establishment of Temoac as a municipality on March 17, 1977.

The third son of Labour politician Donald Anderson, Baron Anderson of Swansea and his missionary wife Dorothy, herself the daughter of Bolivian missionaries, he was raised at his parents' London home in Notting Hill. Anderson was educated at Fox School in Notting Hill and Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. Taking a gap year in Asia, Anderson says he lived the hippy life and smoked dope. He then undertook a degree in history at Queens' College, University of Cambridge, and then an MA in revolutions at Sussex University. Thereafter he went to Goa, India where he eked a living as a hippy selling trinkets on Goa's beaches.

In 1996, Anderson's older brother Hugh who worked as fund manager with Dutch investment bank ABN Amro arranged an interview for him. In a later interview with Al Jazeera, Anderson mused that at that time, he knew nothing about either finance or the City.

Within five years, his salary had jumped from £24,000 to £120,000; his first three years of bonuses: £14,000; £55,000 and £140,000.

Named top stock-picker two years running, appointed joint team leader of the utilities research team, the team becomes number two in the utilities sector and Anderson is personally judged the fourth highest-ranked analyst (out of around 100).

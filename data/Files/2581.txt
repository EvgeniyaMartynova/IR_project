Title: D&b audiotechnik
Aspects: {'D&B (disambiguation)'}

d&b audiotechnik is a German loudspeaker and amplifier manufacturer, founded in 1981, located in Backnang, north of Stuttgart. Although d&b is an international company with subsidiaries in Europe, America and Asia their products are engineered and produced only in Germany. d&b loudspeakers are used in rental and installation markets for events, multimedia, musicals, concert halls, theatres, opera houses, broadcast and everything from the small conference rooms to the large-scale stadiums.
Their claimed unique sales proposition is that they augment the volume, or hearability, of a speaker or musician, but not the quality of the sound.  They supposedly achieve this flat response through digital signal processing (DSP) so that profile changes introduced by loud speakers and other audio components are compensated for and thus eliminated.

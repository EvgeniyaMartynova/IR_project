Żabka Polska (Polish pronunciation: [ˈʐapka]) is a chain of convenience stores in Poland. There are more than 4,500 stores across Poland. Some Żabka stores are located in the Czech Republic. The retail turnover was about EUR 650 million in 2010.

In 2007 Żabka was acquired by Penta Investments. In December 2010 Penta sold the Czech operations of Żabka and Koruna subsidiary to UK retail giant Tesco plc. The transaction was closed in April 2011. In February 2011 Penta signed an agreement to sell the remaining Polish operations Żabka Polska, including the Freshmarket store format, to Mid Europa Partners. In February 2017, Mid Europa Partners closed a deal to sell Żabka for an undisclosed value (but estimated by analysts between 1 and 1,5 billion EUR) to the Luxembourg based CVC Capital Partners. As of 2018 there are 5300 stores, including 500 in Warsaw.

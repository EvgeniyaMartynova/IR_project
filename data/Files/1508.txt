Title: Cladodus
Aspects: {'C. angulatus'}

Cladodus is an extinct genus of cartilaginous fishes in the family Cladoselachidae. As the name implies, they are a type of cladodont, primitive sharks with teeth designed to snag fish and swallow them whole, instead of sawing off chunks to swallow.
Fossils of Cladodus have been found in Barkip, Scotland and in the Pitkin Formation (Carboniferous period) in Arkansas, United States.

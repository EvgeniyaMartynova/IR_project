Title: Q School (snooker)
Aspects: {'Q School'}

The Q School is an amateur snooker competition which serves as the qualification process for the World Snooker Tour.


== Overview ==

The Q School was established in an attempt to streamline the qualification process for the World Snooker Tour. A series of play-offs are run every year before the season. Players pay a fixed entry fee to enter the play-off events, and there is no prize money. Each player who wins a quarter-final game qualifies for a two-year tour card on the Main Tour.


== Winners by event ==
For each event, four winners which qualified for the World Snooker Tour are listed.

NotesMichael Georgiou represented England in 2014, but switched to Cyprus in 2016.


== Statistics ==
Paul Davison and Craig Steadman have both qualified through the event on a record three occasions.
Michael Georgiou is the only Q-School qualifier to win a ranking event.
The highest rank reached by a player who has qualified through Q School is David Gilbert, who as of Nov 2019 is ranked number 10 in the world. This does not include Joe Swail, who was ranked  number 10 long before he dropped off the tour and had to qualify through Q School.

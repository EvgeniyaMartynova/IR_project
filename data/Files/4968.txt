Title: Heliamphora heterodoxa
Aspects: {'H. glabra'}

Heliamphora heterodoxa (Greek: heteros = other, doxa = opinion, belief) is a species of marsh pitcher plant native to Gran Sabana and the plateau of Ptari Tepui in Venezuela. It was first discovered in 1951 upon Ptari Tepui. This Heliamphora is closely related to H. glabra and the latter was for a long time considered a form of H. heterodoxa. It is one of four Heliamphora taxa formally described by Julian A. Steyermark.Heliamphora heterodoxa can tolerate higher temperatures, due to its mainly lowland origins. The plant grows vigorously and exhibits a large, overhanging nectar spoon.

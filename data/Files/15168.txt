== History ==
When General William Henry Harrison took an army from Vincennes to the Battle of Tippecanoe in late 1811, Zachariah Cicott served as a scout. Cicott was familiar with the area because of his time trading up and down the Wabash River starting circa 1801. The trail taken by Harrison's army passed through the area that later became Parke County on its way to and from the battle site in Tippecanoe County. The settlement of Armiesburg was so named because Harrison and his army crossed the Raccoon Creek and camped near there on their way to the battle.The Phillips Covered Bridge and Sim Smith Covered Bridge were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

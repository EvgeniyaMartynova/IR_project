Title: Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane
Aspects: {'QAGOMA'}

The Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) is an art museum located in the South Bank precinct of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The gallery is part of the Queensland Cultural Centre.
GOMA opened on 2 December 2006. It is the Queensland Art Gallery's second building, and is the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art in Australia. It complements the Queensland Art Gallery (QAG) building, situated only 150 metres (490 ft) away. Queensland's Gallery of Modern Art also houses Australia's first purpose built cinematheque. The gallery is situated on Kurilpa Point next to the Queensland Art Gallery and State Library of Queensland and faces the Brisbane River and the CBD. The Gallery of Modern Art has a total floor area over 25,000 square metres (270,000 sq ft) and the largest exhibition gallery is 1,100 square metres (12,000 sq ft). The building was designed by Sydney architecture firm Architectus.
The gallery's first purchase was made in 1895.


== Design ==

In July 2002, Sydney-based company Architectus was commissioned by the Queensland Beattie Government following an Architect Selection Competition, to design the Queensland Art Gallery's second site, the Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA). A main theme of Architectus's design was a pavilion in the landscape, one which assumes its position as both hub and anchor for this important civic precinct. Critical to this is the building's response to the site, its natural topography, existing patterns of urban generation, and the river. Architectus was awarded the 2007 RAIA National Award for Public Architecture for the design of GOMA.

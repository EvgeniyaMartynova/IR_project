Title: Nokia N85
Aspects: {'N85'}

The Nokia N85 is a high-end smartphone produced by Nokia, announced on 27 August 2008 as part of the Nseries line. The N85 runs on Symbian OS v9.3 with S60 3rd Edition platform with Feature Pack 2. It was released in October, retailing for 450 euros before taxes.The major feature N85 introduced was an AMOLED display, giving brighter and sharper colours. The N85 has a dual-slider like the Nokia N95 to access either media playback buttons or a numeric keypad, and is about 25% slimmer in size. The upper sliding keys illuminate between four multimedia keys in music or video playback, and two gaming keys during the playing of N-Gage 2.0 games. It also has a Navi wheel like the Nokia N81 which it replaced and bases its design from, as well as a GPS receiver, 5-megapixel camera with dual LED flash, and an FM transmitter.The N85 was well received as a decent upgrade to the N95, as well as better than the actual flagship, Nokia N96, which costed 100 euros more with few additions and was somewhat critically negative. Compared to the N96, the N85 is thinner and lighter, has a camera lens cover, has a larger battery capacity, USB charging (via the microUSB port), and a AMOLED screen; although without large internal memory or a DVB-H receiver.

Title: European route E12
Aspects: {'E12'}

European route E12 is a road that is part of the International E-road network. It begins in Mo i Rana, Norway, transverses Sweden and ends in Helsinki, Finland, with a ferry line between Sweden and Finland. The part within Finland is Finnish national highway 3. The road is about 910 km (570 mi) in length.
The road follows the route:  Mo i Rana – Storuman, Sweden – Lycksele, Sweden – Umeå, Sweden – Holmsund, Sweden – (ferry) – Vaasa, Finland – Tampere, Finland – Hämeenlinna, Finland – Helsinki.
The ferry line has one departure per day. It risks being cancelled because a commercial company operates it, and it is unprofitable because of low passenger figures. There is no government support, only domestic connections can get it, since it is a principle especially in Sweden that international travel should not be supported by taxpayers. However, the city of Vaasa supports the ferry route.

Title: IdeaPad Y series
Aspects: {'Y series'}

The IdeaPad Y series is a consumer range of laptops produced by Lenovo, first announced in 2008. They are marketed as premium high performance laptops for multimedia and gaming, as part of the IdeaPad line. The most significant differences from Lenovo's traditional ThinkPad business laptops were a more consumer-oriented appearance and performance-oriented components. IdeaPads feature a chiclet keyboard with rounded keys, similar to the latest ThinkPads. The first of the Y series were the IdeaPad Y710 and the IdeaPad Y510 notebooks, with screen sizes of 17 inches and 15 inches respectively. Not all features were entirely new, however. Notebook Review reported that the Y710 and Y510 notebooks had a keyboard that felt similar to the ThinkPad when used, despite the absence of the TrackPoint. The Y50 and Y40, released in 2014, featured a gaming-oriented design shift and slimming down. The latest release was the Y700 in late 2015. 
The IdeaPad Y series has since been replaced by the Legion Y series.

==== Y900 ====
Lenovo announced the IdeaPad Y900 in January 2016. It uses Intel Core i7 processors that can be overclocked. Lenovo has included utility software to make this easier for users. The chassis is black aluminum with color accents. The keyboard is mechanical. Customizable color LEDs help the trackpad and various parts of the keyboard stand out more clearly in dark environments. The display is 17.3 inches, uses an IPS panel with an anti-glare coating, and resolution is 1920 × 1080 pixels. Up to 64 GB of RAM is supported. Bays are included for two SSDs or hard drives, RAID 0 is supported. An Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M comes standard with options for either 4 GB or 8 GB of VRAM.


== 2015 ==


==== Y70 ====
The Y70 is a gaming laptop with a 17-inch multitouch screen. As of February 2015, the Y70 base model had a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, a 1 TB SSD/HDD hybrid, and a 2 GB Nvidia GTX 860M GPU. The display has 1080p resolution and LED backlighting. The Y70 scored 4.5 hours of battery life on MobileMark's Office Productivity Test but is only able to achieve a battery life of about 2.5 hours for gaming.A review from Notebook Review said, "We’re happy to recognize the Lenovo IdeaPad Y70 Touch with our Editor’s Choice award for being a great large screen entertainment notebook."


== 2014 ==
There were two flagship laptops released in 2014  Lenovo Ideapad Y40, Y50 and Y70 Touch.


==== Y40 and Y50 ====
The Y40 and Y50 are respectively 14-inch and 15-inch laptops designed specifically for gaming. 1080p displays come standard on both models, but the Y50 has an option for a 4K display with a resolution of 3840 × 2160. Both come with options for multi-touch displays. Both have Intel Core i7 processors. The Y40 uses an AMD Radeon R9 M270 video card with 2 GB of VRAM; The Y50 uses an Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M video card with options for 2 GB and 4 GB of VRAM. Later models now use the Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M video card. They come standard with 8 GB of RAM (expandable up to 16 GB). The Y40 comes standard with a 256 GB SSD and the Y50 comes standard with a 1 TB hybrid drive. Both are only 0.9 inches (23 mm) thick. They respectively weigh 4.85 lb (2.20 kg) and 5.68 lb (2.58 kg). Neither has an optical drive. The Y40 and Y50 were announced at the 2014 International CES in Las Vegas and went on sale in the United States in May of the same year.In a review for PC World, Hayden Dingman wrote, "In terms of gaming performance, Lenovo’s Y50 is one of the best laptops in its class. It’s a great choice if you’re looking for a portable gaming rig on a budget. Unfortunately, Lenovo compromised several key components—the keyboard, trackpad, and (most importantly) the display—in order to offer the Y50 at a mid-range price. Hook up a mouse, keyboard, and external display and you’ll have a solid gaming machine. If you can’t tolerate those compromises, you might have to bite the bullet and spend more money for a competitor’s offering." In a review for LAPTOP, Sherri L. Smith wrote, "Lenovo continues to impress me with its ability to offer gaming laptops at affordable prices. For $949, shoppers get a sleek-looking 14-inch notebook with solid overall performance and long battery life. However, while the AMD Radeon R9 M275 GPU isn't a lightweight, you won't be fragging or questing at the maximum settings. I also wish the notebook featured a better display and keyboard."

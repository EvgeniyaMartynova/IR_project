Title: C-Note (band)
Aspects: {'C-Note'}

C-Note (acronym of Creating Nothing Other Than Excellence) is a boy band from Orlando, Florida. The group scored success in 1999 with their debut album, Different Kind of Love.


== History ==
The group formed in 1997 in Orlando for the purposes of performing in a talent show. Three of the group's members had been in a previous vocal harmony group, but the five-member group lost two members, and a fourth was recruited, completing the group's later lineup. Their performance at the competition resulted in attention from the backers of Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, and soon after a record deal ensued. Incorporating Latin elements into their dance-pop sound, the group toured America in 1998 and released their debut album, Different Kind of Love, on Sony Records the next year. Different Kind of Love spawned a radio hit, "Wait Til I Get Home", which peaked at #33 on Billboard's Top 40 Mainstream charts in 1999. On the strength of the single, Different Kind of Love peaked at #163 on the Billboard Top 200.

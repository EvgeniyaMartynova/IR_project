Title: KKDA-FM
Aspects: {'K104'}

KKDA-FM, known as K104, has been a leading radio station in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex for 46 years. It is a longtime heritage Urban Contemporary formatted station that broadcasts on 104.5 MHz. It is owned by Service Broadcasting Corporation alongside KRNB and its former AM counterpart KKDA AM. Its studios are located in Arlington, Texas, and the transmitter site is in Cedar Hill.
Its longtime morning drive show, Skip Murphy and the Home Team, was ranked number 1 during the morning drive time slot for nearly a decade, according to Arbitron ratings.  Over the last few years, several popular personalities on the show, such as comedian Nannette Lee and Wig, have moved on. The most recent personality to leave was Thomas "Skip" Murphy. He announced in July 2008 that he was moving to sister radio station KRNB (105.7) to work weekdays from 3 pm to 7 pm. Nationally syndicated personality Tom Joyner became recognized as the "Fly Jock" because he hosted the morning drive slot on K104 and traveled regularly to host an afternoon drive slot on WGCI-FM in Chicago. His show was heard later on KRNB and most recently aired on KZMJ.


== History ==
104.5 FM began operation on June 8, 1947, as KIXL.  KIXL (pronounced "Kicksil") aired a successful beautiful music format, simulcast on both 104.5 FM and 1040 AM ("104 on both dials"). A pioneer in the "mood music" format, the station showed up in the top five in Dallas market ratings consistently through 1968, but by the beginning of the 1970s KIXL was facing tough competition from KOAX, which had come to dominate as the top-rated easy listening station. In 1973, the year Dallas and Fort Worth were combined into one radio market, KIXL dropped its heritage calls in favor of KEZT, continuing to play easy-listening musical fare. The change did not improve the station's fortunes, as KEZT never appeared in the top 10 of the Dallas/Fort Worth ratings, while KOAX's success continued and 100.3 KTLC provided additional competition in the beautiful music format.
On December 22, 1976 KEZT changed to an Urban Contemporary station as well changing their call letters as KKDA-FM along with their official moniker The All New K104 FM, under the leadership of new owner Hyman Childs.  K104 was initially the FM counterpart to KKDA AM (Soul 73), which aired R&B and soul music during the day and gospel at night. KKDA-FM primarily began as a disco station with the two slogans, K104 is Disco soul! and K104 is Disco! then through the early to mid 1980s, KKDA-FM shifted into an CHR/UC format (also known as "CHUrban", which is the predecessor to the current Rhythmic CHR format) while retaining the K104 branding, first in 1983 with K104, This is it! and in 1985 with K104, Jammin' with the music! But then in the late 1980s, the station was briefly known as The All New Hot 104, KKDA-FM. But it was dropped immediately and went back to K104 with their new slogan K104, We've got it goin' on! (During the station's disco era, K104 had a mascot that billed itself as The K104 Disco Chicken).

Through the mid-1990s, under the leadership of new GM Ken Dowe and new PD Michael Spears, K104 skewed its former urban contemporary format with slower R&B and soul songs at night and gospel on Sunday mornings, towards the Mainstream Urban genre consisting of a Hip-Hop and current R&B heavy playlist. That format helped project K104 to being one of the highest-rated radio stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth DMA, where it has remained to this day.
Competitively, KKDA also has a current crosstown rivalry with another CHUrban station KBFB ("97.9 The Beat"), who has taken advantage of KKDA's 'traditional' urban direction and used that to their advantage, resulting in the two fighting it out for R&B/hip hop dominance in the Metroplex. Their first competition until 1985 was the now defunct R&B radio station KNOK 107.5 (which used the slogan "Disco and More!") and their second competitor from 1988 until 1995 was station KJMZ (known as "100.3 Jamz"). In addition, they also once had a competitor in rhythmic contemporary rival KZZA ("Casa 106.7"), which had shifted from a Hispanic rhythmic direction, since KKDA also has a sizable share of Hispanic listeners.  However, KZZA is a rimshot signal.  KNOR was considered a competitor from 2004-2006 as it was the only station in the Metroplex having a similar format to KKDA-FM's urban contemporary format.
As the FCC loosened radio station ownership rules with the passing of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, virtually all major market radio stations became part of large broadcast groups such as iHeartMedia, Cumulus, and others.  Today, KKDA-FM is one of the few remaining major market commercial stations in the nation that is still owned by a local, non-corporate broadcaster.

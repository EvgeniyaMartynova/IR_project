Title: BMW Z3
Aspects: {'Z-car (disambiguation)'}

The BMW Z3 is a range of two-seater sports cars which was produced from 1995 to 2002. The body styles of the range are:

2-door roadster (E36/7 model code)
2-door coupé (E36/8 model code)The Z3 was based on the E36 3 Series platform, while using the rear semi-trailing arm suspension design of the older E30 3 Series. It is the first mass-produced BMW Z Series car.
Z3M models were introduced in 1998 in roadster and coupé body styles and were powered by the S50, S52, or S54 straight-six engine depending on country and model year. The M models came with a 5-speed manual transmission.
Production ended on June 28, 2002, with the Z3 line replaced by the Z4.


== Development and launch ==
Development on the roadster began in 1991 and was led by Burkhard Göschel. The exterior was designed by Joji Nagashima, being completed in mid-1992 at 39 months before production and the design was frozen in 1993. Design patents were filed on April 2, 1994 in Germany and on September 27, 1994 in the US. The Z3 was introduced via video press release by BMW North America on June 12, 1995. Production began on September 20, 1995.Development on the coupé model was run by a group of BMW engineers outside of work in their own time. The Z3 Coupé shares the same platform and parts with the roadster, but features a chassis-stiffening hatch area and is 2.7 times stiffer in comparison. The Z3 Coupé was unveiled at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show.
The Z3 was the first BMW model to be solely manufactured outside of Germany. It was manufactured in Greer, South Carolina.

== Z3M versions ==

The Z3M versions were introduced in 1997 in the roadster (M Roadster) and coupé (M Coupé) body styles. European models were initially powered by the S50 engine, while North American models were powered by the S52 engine. In 2001 both the European and North American models switched to the new S54 engine. Models were only available with a 5-speed manual transmission.
Compared to the standard Z3, M models featured a limited slip differential, a wider rear track, and larger brakes (that are shared with the E36 M3). Z3M models were available in M-specific colors, they feature more aerodynamic wing-mirrors as well as redesigned front and rear bumpers and bespoke "Roadstar" Style 40 wheels, revised side gill and quad exhausts. The interior can also be differentiated by the voltmeter, clock and oil temperature gauges in the center console, leather-wrapped center console and door pulls, as well as unique M-styled seats and interior color options.
Unlike the rest of the Z3 range, the Z3M did not receive cosmetic changes during the facelift in 2000.

		
		


== Special Models ==


=== James Bond Edition ===

To tie in with the appearance in the GoldenEye film, BMW released a "James Bond Edition" Z3 for sale through the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalogue. The James Bond Edition sold in 1996 for US$35,000. BMW and Neiman Marcus had originally set a 20-unit sales goal, but was later increased to 100 units after receiving a high level of interest orders.
The James Bond Edition was based on the Z3 1.9 and included a 007 dash plaque, 007 Bond floor mats, unique wheels, and chrome exterior trim. The colour scheme was an "Atlantic blue" exterior with beige leather interior, as per the Z3 which appeared in GoldenEye.


=== V12 prototype ===
In 1999, the BMW M division produced a single prototype Z3 powered by the 5.4 L M73 V12 engine, in order to test the space efficiency of the engine bay. It is based on a convertible Z3, wears 17 inch wheels with 225/45 tires up front and 245/40 at the back, and is painted in a shade of orange. The V12 produces 322 hp (240 kW; 326 PS) at 5,000 rpm and 490 N⋅m (361 lb⋅ft) of torque at 3,900 rpm, and power is sent through a 6-speed manual transmission. The concept is much heavier than the standard Z3 at 1,400 kg (3,086 lb), giving it 70/30 weight distribution. The concept was only shown once, which was in 1999 to the motoring magazine Autozeitung. Their tests revealed a 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time of 5.5 seconds, 0 to 1,000m (0.62 miles) in 24.4 seconds, and a top speed of 263 km/h (163 mph).

== Marketing ==
The Z3 appeared briefly in the James Bond movie GoldenEye, in a scene where Bond is driving in Cuba. The Z3 is one of few non-British production cars to be driven by James Bond in a movie, and the first of three James Bond films featuring a BMW car. The Z3 in GoldenEye features stinger missiles hidden behind the headlights, an emergency parachute braking system and a radar scanner in the form of a LCD screen in the dashboard. It is also noted during the briefing scene, that the car contains a passenger ejector seat and a self-destruct system.Two blue prototypes were provided in January 1995 for filming at the Leavesden Aerodrome. The agreement between BMW and Eon Productions was for cross-promotion of the car and the film, and there was no financial component.Sales of the Z3 spiked as the film sat at number one at the box office. In the 1996 production run, more than 15,000 roadsters were sold out by the time the car was introduced.

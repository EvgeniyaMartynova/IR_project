Title: Caloptilia aurantiaca
Aspects: {'C. aurantiaca'}

Caloptilia aurantiaca is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Madeira and the Canary Islands.
The larvae feed on Hypericum canariense, Hypericum glandulosum, Hypericum inodorum and Hypericum reflexum. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as an epidermal corridor, but later becomes a shallow tentiform mine. In the end, the larva lives freely under a folded leaf tip.

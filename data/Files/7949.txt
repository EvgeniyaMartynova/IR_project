Title: Lysimachia vulgaris
Aspects: {'L. vulgaris'}

Lysimachia vulgaris, the  yellow loosestrife or garden loosestrife, is a species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It is native to wetlands, damp meadows and forests of south-east Europe. It is a tall plant with an upright habit, 50–150 centimetres (20–59 in) high, with erect panicles of conspicuous yellow flowers. The edges of the petals lack the fringe of hairs seen in L. punctata, and the hairy sepals have a conspicuous orange margin.  It is in bloom from June through August in the British Isles. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate and spotted with translucent orange glands.  L. vulgaris spreads by rhizomes, forming extensive patches and is sometimes considered invasive outside of its native range. In Australia growers have now successfully propagated and started growing the white variety in January in Tasmania.

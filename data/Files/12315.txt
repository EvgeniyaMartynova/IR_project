Title: Daewoo S-TEC engine
Aspects: {'S-TEC'}

S-TEC or M-TEC is a low-displacement engine range co-developed by Suzuki and Daewoo Motors for use in micro- and subcompact cars.


== S-TEC ==
The first model was 0.8 L (796 cc) SOHC straight-three engine based on the powerplant of the Suzuki Alto.
In 2002, the range was extended to 1.0 L (995 cc)  and 1.2 L (1,150 cc) inline-four engines and updated with EGR valve to reduce emission. A new engine plant for the updated model T4 was built. The 1.0 version is used in Chevrolet Matiz and the 1.2 in the European Chevrolet Kalos.
In 2004 the 0.8 and 1.0 engines were updated again. New intake and exhaust systems, along with low-friction aluminum cam followers with rollers were added, resulting in better economy.

==== Planned for theatrical release, but never screened theatrically ====
Originally planned for theatrical release in 2004, but were released direct-to-DVD (except for The Whizzard of Ow which premiered in Wal-Mart stores) due to Looney Tunes: Back In Action's commercial failure. All cartoons are produced by Sander Schwartz and Larry Doyle, and produced in widescreen (but cropped to fullscreen). There were several stories planned and storyboarded in 2004 but many of them were canceled due to the box-office failure of Looney Tunes: Back in Action.

== Miscellaneous shorts ==
In addition to the shorts listed below is a stop-motion animated George Pal Puppetoon named Jasper Goes Hunting released by Paramount Pictures in 1944 which contains a brief traditionally animated cameo appearance by Bugs Bunny animated by Robert McKimson. The 1994 short I'm Mad, shown with the film Thumbelina, is considered more a part of the Animaniacs TV series.

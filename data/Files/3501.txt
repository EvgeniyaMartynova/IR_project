Flindersia australis, the crow's ash or Australian teak, is a rainforest tree from New South Wales and Queensland in Australia.  It grows up to 40 metres high, with larger trees having a buttressed trunk. The leaves are alternate or occasionally   opposite and have between 3 and 13 leaflets. Each of these is 2.4 to 13 cm long and 0.8 to 4.3 cm wide. Flowers appear during spring forming inflorescences to 15 cm long. These have white or cream petals which are between 5 and 7 mm long. Both the petals and sepals are covered with hair. The flowers are followed by woody capsules which are 7 to 10 cm long. These split open to reveal the winged seeds.

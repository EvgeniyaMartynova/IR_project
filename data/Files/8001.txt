Title: Maison de l'Art Nouveau
Aspects: {"L'Art Nouveau"}

The Maison de l'Art Nouveau ("House of New Art"), abbreviated often as  L'Art Nouveau, and known also as Maison Bing for the owner, was a gallery opened  on 26 December 1895, by Siegfried Bing at 22 rue de Provence, Paris.The building was designed by the architect Louis Bonnier (1856–1946).
Unlike his earlier stores at the same location and nearby at 19 rue Chauchat that specialised in Japonism and imports from Asia, the gallery specialised in modern art. The original exhibition featured windows designed by Nabi artists, including Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and made by Louis Comfort Tiffany.The fame of his gallery was increased at the 1900 Exposition Universelle, where he presented co-ordinated—in design and colour—installations of modern furniture, tapestries and objets d'art. These decorative displays became associated strongly with an artistic style that was becoming popular across Europe, and for which his gallery subsequently provided a name: Art Nouveau.

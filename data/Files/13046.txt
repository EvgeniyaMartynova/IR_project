Aspects: {'T. brassicae'}

Trichogramma brassicae is a species of parasitoid wasps from the Trichogrammatidae family. It mainly parasitizes Lepidopteran hosts in agricultural fields. They are entomaphagous parasitoids that deposit their own eggs inside the host's eggs, consuming the host egg material and emerging upon full development. They are a common biological control species that have been used commercially since the late 1970s.

Title: K-11 (Kansas highway)
Aspects: {'K11'}

K-11 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas, and uses parts of what was formerly K-14 before it was realigned. The 16.662-mile-long (26.815 km) highway connects US-54/US-400 west of Kingman with K-61 west of Arlington.


== Route description ==
K-11 begins at US-54 and US-400, which run concurrently eastâ€“west, between Kingman and Cunningham in north central Kingman County. The highway heads north along a section line road. K-11 passes 2 miles (3.2 km) east of the Charles M. Prather Barn and crosses Smoots Creek, a tributary of the South Fork Ninnescah River. The highway enters Reno County, where it crosses Goose Creek and Wolf Creek, both tributaries of the North Fork Ninnescah River. K-11 reaches its northern terminus west of the city of Arlington just south of a Union Pacific Railroad line at an intersection with K-61 between Partridge and Langdon.


== History ==
K-11 was designated along what is now K-99 in 1927. In 1938, K-11 was renumbered to K-99 to match Oklahoma. In 1940, another K-11 was created from Kiowa to the Oklahoma border as a replacement of a part of K-8, which was truncated because of the extension of US 281 into Kansas. In December 1959, K-11 was cancelled and transferred back to K-8. In 2013, K-14 was realigned to the now defunct K-17, and K-11 took over a section of original K-14 alignment.

Title: NPP Zvezda K-36
Aspects: {'K36'}

The Zvezda K-36 is a series of ejection seats made by NPP Zvezda. Variants of this ejection seat have been used on a variety of aircraft, including the Su-25, Su-27, MiG-29, and the Su-57.


== Design ==
The K-36 Ejection seat provides emergency escape for a crew member in a wide range of speeds and altitudes of aircraft flight, from zero altitude, zero speed (zero-zero) upwards, and can be used in conjunction with protective equipment, such as pressure suits and anti-g garments. The seat consists of the ejection rocket firing mechanism, gear box, headrest rescue system with a dome stowed in the headrest, and other operating systems all of which are aimed at providing a safe bail-out. The ejection seat ensures safe emergency escape of a pilot within the range of velocities (Ve) from 0 to 1,300 km/h (700 kn; 810 mph) to 1,400 km/h (760 kn; 870 mph) (depending on the type of protective equipment), altitudes from 0 to 20,000 m (66,000 ft) and Mach numbers up to 2.5.
The ejection seat is used in combination KKO-15 protective and oxygen equipment and the installation weight of the seat is less than 103 kg (227 lb) (including the parachute system, survival kit, emergency oxygen system and pyrotechnic charges).


=== Operational ejections ===
Notable ejections using the K-36 occurred at the 1989 Paris Air Show when Anatoly Kvochur successfully  completed a low-altitude ejection from a MiG-29 just prior to ground impact. Two more pilots survived when a pair of MiG-29s collided over Fairford, England, in 1993 at the Royal International Air Tattoo.


== Variants ==
K-36D and K-36DM: Used on the MiG-29, Su-27
K-36D-3.5: Improved variant providing accommodation for pilots with sitting heights from 810 to 980 mm
K-36D-5: Improved variant for the Sukhoi Su-57
K-36LM: Used in the Tu-160 Blackjack
K-36RB: Variant used on Buran programme
K-36VM: Automatic ejection system (SKE) used successfully 20/20 times in the Yak-38


== In popular culture ==
Players of the video game Hitman and Hitman 2 receive an achievement for assassinating the character Jasper Knight using a sabotaged ejection seat. The achievement is named after the K-36D variant.

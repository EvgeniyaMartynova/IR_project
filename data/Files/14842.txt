== Books ==


=== The Arc of a Covenant ===

His next book, The Arc of a Covenant: The United States, Israel, and the Fate of the Jewish People will be published by Knopf in 2018. Mead argues that Gentile support for a Jewish state as well as geopolitical realities have influenced US policy towards Israel as much as anything else.


=== God and Gold ===
In October 2007, he published God and Gold: Britain, America, and the Making of the Modern World about the Anglo-American tradition of world power from the seventeenth century to the present. It argues that the individualism inherent in British and American religion was instrumental for their rise to global power, and integrates Francis Fukuyama's "end of history" with Samuel Huntington's "clash of civilizations" in its predictions for the future. The Economist, The Financial Times and The Washington Post all listed God and Gold as one of the best non-fiction books of its year.


=== Power, Terror, Peace and War ===
In June 2005, Mead published Power, Terror, Peace and War: America's Grand Strategy in a World at Risk. The book outlines American foreign policy under the Bush administration after September 11, 2001 and contextualizes it in the history of American foreign policy. In it, Mead recommends changes in the American approach to terror, the Israel-Palestine dispute, and international institutions.


=== Special Providence ===

In 2001, Mead published Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How it Changed the World. It won the Lionel Gelber Award for the best book in English on International Relations in 2002. The Italian translation won the Premio Acqui Storia, an annual award for the most important historical book published. Special Providence, which stemmed from an article originally published in the Winter 1999/2000 issue of The National Interest, "The Jacksonian Tradition,"  describes the four main guiding philosophies that have influenced the formation of American foreign policy in history: the Hamiltonians, the Wilsonians, the Jeffersonians and the Jacksonians.The New Left Review praised the book as a 'robust celebration of Jacksonianism as it historically was ... an admiring portrait of a tough, xenophobic folk community, ruthless to outsiders or deserters, rigid in its codes of honour and violence.' Not all critics praised the book, however. "Despite the hype surrounding the book, it ultimately challenges little," geographer Joseph Nevins wrote. "To the contrary, it reinforces the tired notion of U.S. exceptionalism. Thus, he [Mead] paints U.S. deployment of violence as inherently less brutal than that of Washington's enemies. In doing so, he sometimes grossly understates the human devastation wrought by the United States."


==== Jacksonianism and the Trump Administration ====
Of the four traditions of American politics described in Special Providence, Jacksonianism has received the most attention. Mead has expanded and applied his description of Jacksonianism in his other writings.The idea of a Jacksonian tradition in American politics has received greater interest and attention since the candidacy and election of President Donald Trump, in particular because of former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon's references to Jackson and comparisons of Jackson to Trump. The New York Times has speculated that Bannon drew inspiration from Mead's description of Jacksonianism in Special Providence.In an interview with Politico, Mead was dubbed the "Trump Whisperer" by the author Susan Glasser.


=== Mortal Splendor ===
Mead's first book, Mortal Splendor: The American Empire in Transition, was published in 1987. Mead argues that American policy under Nixon and Carter stifled sustainable development in the Third World. Reviewing the book in Foreign Affairs, John C. Campbell called Mortal Splendor "a brilliantly written demolition of both liberal and especially conservative shibboleths concerning the political economy of the United States, both in its domestic and international arrangements."


== Publications ==

Mead is a new Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Global View Columnist, a regular contributor to Foreign Affairs magazine and a book reviewer for Foreign Affairs.From 2009 until August 2017, Mead oversaw a daily blog, "Via Meadia", on the website of the journal American Interest. Mead published a piece in the 2014 May/June issue of Foreign Affairs titled "The Return of Geopolitics."


=== Positions on interventions in recent conflicts ===
In 2003, he argued that an Iraq War was preferable to continuing UN sanctions against Iraq, because "Each year of containment is a new Gulf War", and that "The existence of al Qaeda, and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, are part of the price the United States has paid to contain Saddam Hussein."He has since written about the Iraq War's failures, and about the need for the Republican Party to come to terms with them.Mead was critical of the Obama administration's failure to contain the fallout from the "reckless and thoughtless" 2011 NATO intervention in Libya.Mead was also critical of Obama's failure to enforce the "red line" in Syria, arguing that the President's empty statement had damaged American credibility and encouraged Russia and Iran to ramp up their direct support for the Assad regime. Mead supported arming Syrian rebels.

Mead has written extensively about the decline of the "Blue Social Model," which refers to the political and economic status quo of the United States following the New Deal and the Second World War.

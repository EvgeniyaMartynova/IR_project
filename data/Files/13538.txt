Students may also apply up to 31 hours of legal coursework completed at another ABA-accredited law school.Additionally, all students must attend several presentations beyond their regular classes.  These presentations qualify for "Professional Perspectives" or "Career Perspectives" credit, depending on the nature of the lecture and whether the Dean's office or the Office of Career Development sponsors the presentation.  These presentations are usually hosted by student organizations.
Students also must complete a "Writing Requirement," in which the student conducts original research and drafts a paper on that issue.

== Journals ==
 The law school has a unique method for selecting associates to its three law journals.  Unlike other schools that base placement entirely on grades, the University of Missouri School of Law uses a write-on system.  After final exams in the spring semester are completed, packets are made available to all interested students.  In the packet are two assignments: the first is a case and exclusive list of citations to other sources; and the second is a mock list of footnotes.  Applicants to the law journals must write a case note based on the case in the packet, using as citations only those sources specifically listed.  Applicants must also edit the mock list of footnotes for errors, pursuant to the Bluebook method of citation.  Applicants must then return the entire packet, as well as a list identifying their preferred law journals.
The Editors-in-Chief and other editors blind-grade the submissions.  Law school administrative assistants rank each student three times: first, by weighting the applicants' GPAs at 80% and their written submissions 20%; then, by weighting the GPAs at 20% and the written submissions at 80%; lastly, by ranking solely based on the scores of the written submissions.  The Editors-in-Chief then select which applicants they want.  The Missouri Law Review selects first based on the 80/20 rankings, then the Journal of Dispute Resolution, then the Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review (formerly the Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law).  Then, they pick again in order, this time based on the 20/80 rankings, and finally they select based on the 0/100 rankings.


=== Missouri Law Review ===
The Missouri Law Review is the law school's oldest law journal.  It is entirely student-run and student-edited and publishes four times a year.  Since 1936, when publication began, it has been cited over sixteen hundred times in published court opinions, including over twenty occasions by the Supreme Court of the United States.Each spring the law review hosts a symposium on a different part of the law.  Noted scholars and practitioners in the given area give a presentation, and then they write an article which the law review publishes later that year.


=== Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review ===
The Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review ("BETR") is a student-edited and led publication that creates a three-part publication and hosts an annual symposium providing cutting-edge information and legal analysis over a wide range of issues.

=== Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law ===
The Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law, or JESL, formerly known as the Missouri Environmental Law & Policy Review, was a joint venture between the School of Law and the Missouri Bar Association.

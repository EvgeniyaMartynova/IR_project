== Distribution ==
This species inhabits the west coast of Madagascar in the general area of Majunga. It can also be found in the Comoros, in Zanzibar, and some coastal areas of mainland Tanzania.


== Habitat ==
P. dubia can easily adapt to different biotopes. These day geckos are often found on different trees and other lowland vegetation. They also inhabit buildings as a human commensal.


== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen, nectar and balsamic vinegar.


== Behaviour ==
P. dubia often lives in small groups with one male and several females.


== Reproduction ==
The females are egg gluers. They often lay their eggs in the same location as other females.


== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
Phelsuma dubia is currently common and widespread. However, capture of these geckos is regulated, as it may have caused population declines and, as it is large-scale, might threaten the species in the future.These animals should be housed in pairs and need a medium-sized terrarium. The temperature should be between 25 and 28 °C. The humidity should be not too high. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth, fruit flies, meal worms and houseflies.

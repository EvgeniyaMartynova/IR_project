HMS Battleaxe was a Type 22 frigate of the British Royal Navy. She was sold to the Brazilian Navy on 30 April 1997 and renamed Rademaker.


== Construction and design ==
Battleaxe was ordered by the British Admiralty on 4 September 1974, as the second Batch I Type 22 Frigate. The ship was laid down at Yarrow Shipbuilders' Scotstoun shipyard on 4 February 1976, and was launched by Audrey Callaghan, the wife of James Callaghan, the Prime Minister at the time, on 18 May 1977. Battleaxe was completed on 28 March 1980.Battleaxe was 131.2 metres (430 ft 5 in) long overall and 125.7 metres (412 ft 5 in) at the waterline, with a beam of 14.8 metres (48 ft 7 in) and a draught of 6.1 metres (20 ft 0 in). Displacement was 4,000 long tons (4,100 t) standard and 4,400 long tons (4,500 t) deep load.  She was powered by two Rolls-Royce Olympus TM3B gas turbines rated at a total of 54,600 shaft horsepower (40,700 kW) and two Rolls-Royce Tyne R1MC turbines rated at a total of 9,700 shaft horsepower (7,200 kW), driving two shafts in a Combined gas or gas (COGOG) arrangement. They gave a speed of 30 knots (35 mph; 56 km/h) when powered by the Olympuses and 18 knots (21 mph; 33 km/h) when powered by the Tynes. The ship had a range of 4,500 nautical miles (5,200 mi; 8,300 km) at 18 knots (21 mph; 33 km/h).Anti-aircraft armament consisted of two sextuple Sea Wolf surface-to-air missile launchers, one forward of the bridge, and one on the roof of the helicopter hangar. Four Exocet MM-38 anti-ship missiles were fitted on the forecastle. Gun armament was limited to a pair of 40 mm Bofors guns, mainly for peacetime patrol duties. A hangar and fight deck was fitted aft, allowing the ship to operate two Westland Lynx helicopters, which could carry anti submarine torpedoes, while close-in anti submarine armament was two triple STWS-1 324-millimetre (12.8 in) torpedo tubes.


== Operational history ==


=== Royal Navy ===
Battleaxe was at Gibraltar on 24 March 1982, as part of Exercise "Springtrain 82", but when the Falklands War broke out in April that year, she, unlike sister-ships Broadsword and Brilliant, did not deploy to the South Atlantic as she was suffering from problems with her propeller shafts. Battlexe did deploy to the South Atlantic shortly after the end of the war, however, escorting the aircraft carrier Illustrious, leaving Devonport on 2 August, reaching the vicinity of the Falklands on 24 August and returning to Britain on 19 November. She was deployed to the South Atlantic again from July 1983 to December 1983.


=== Brazil ===

Rademaker was involved in an unfortunate incident on 29 November 2004, during the annual FRATERNO naval exercise with ships of the Argentinian Navy. While conducting gunnery practice against target drones, a malfunction of the Argentinian frigate ARA Sarandi's automatic weapons system caused her to fire on the Rademaker; four Brazilian crewmen were injured together with an Argentine naval observer. The ship suffered moderate damage.
Also in 2004, Rademaker deployed to Port-au-Prince, as part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti.
In April 2017, Rademaker was involved in the search for the missing bulk carrier Stellar Daisy after she disappeared in the Atlantic.Rademaker joined the international efforts to locate the missing Argentine Submarine San Juan in November 2017.

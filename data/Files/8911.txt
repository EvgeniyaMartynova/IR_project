Title: N-group (category theory)
Aspects: {'N-group'}

In mathematics, an n-group, or n-dimensional higher group, is a special kind of n-category that generalises the concept of group to higher-dimensional algebra.  Here, n may be any natural number or infinity. The thesis of Alexander Grothendieck's student Hoàng Xuân Sính was an in-depth study of 2-groups under the moniker 'gr-category'.
The general definition of n-group is a matter of ongoing research.  However, it is expected that every topological space will have a homotopy n-group at every point, which will encapsulate the Postnikov tower of the space up to the homotopy group πn, or the entire Postnikov tower for n = ∞.
The definition and many properties of 2-groups are already known.  A 1-group is simply a group, and the only 0-group is trivial. 2-groups can be described using crossed modules.

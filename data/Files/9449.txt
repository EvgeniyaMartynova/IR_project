Title: O Canada (TV series)
Aspects: {'O Canada (disambiguation)'}

O Canada is a Canadian-American animated television anthology series, broadcast in the United States on Cartoon Network. O Canada was the first Canadian cartoon series to air on Cartoon Network. The show also frequently airs in Canada on Teletoon, but not as much as it did in the United States on Cartoon Network.
Shown mainly on Sunday nights (early Monday mornings) at 12:00 midnight ET, O Canada featured a selection of animated shorts from Canada, mostly from the archives of the National Film Board of Canada. Some of the animated shorts featured were part of the NFB's Canada Vignettes collection of shorts first produced for CBC Television.
The title of the series originated from the name of Canada's national anthem, "O Canada".
One of the notable shorts featured in this series was Bob's Birthday, which would later serve as the basis for Comedy Central / Global Television Network's Bob and Margaret series, which would debut the following year. Despite its time slot, Bob's Birthday was censored with one scene, that featured Bob fully bottomless, edited with a maple leaf electronically superimposed over his genitalia.

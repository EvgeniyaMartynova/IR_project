Nishi Tiwari of Rediff.com wrote in a 1 out of 5 stars review that the film was "criminally unremarkable", criticising the story, and Deol's acting as he felt he wasn't a good fit for a romantic comedy. Troy Ribeiro of NDTV gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, commenting the plot was "silly and far-fetched", and that Deol was miscast. Ribeiro pointed to Ranaut's performance as being the highlight of the film stating that she played her character with conviction. Filmfare reviewer Rachit Gupta gave the film 3 out of 5 stars criticising the film's "mish-mash of sentimentality, annoying characters and clichéd rom com developments". Gupta also felt that Deol and Ranaut as a pair was a miscast, with Deol particularly not gelling as a romantic comedy lead. He also felt that the music was forgettable. However Gupta did praise Ranaut who he commented was the highlight of the film as "She's quite literally too good to be in this film".

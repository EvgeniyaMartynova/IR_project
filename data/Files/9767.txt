=== Summary ===
Tyler Reddick began on pole, but Christopher Bell took the lead on lap 6. Bell dominated in the first half, winning both stages. 
When the final stage began, Austin Cindric grabbed the lead and led until Chase Briscoe had a flat right rear tire and made contact with the wall, bringing out a caution on lap 129. Reddick briefly got the lead but lost it to Chastain, who took and kept the lead on lap 144. 
On lap 151, Noah Gragson tried to squeeze between Harrison Burton and Jeb Burton. He got tapped by Harrison and wrecked his car after spinning through the grass for his first DNF of 2019. The race was briefly red-flagged.
Chastain continued to lead on the restart, but Reddick hit the inside wall and brought out a late caution. Briscoe was also struggling as his right front tire disintegrated with 25 laps remaining, but NASCAR didn’t throw a caution. This forced Briscoe to ultimately finish 22nd.
Bell regained the lead on the lap 170 restart and he never looked back. He ultimately took the win, leading 101 laps  and finishing ahead of Chastain by 5 seconds. Bell also secured a spot in the Championship race at Homestead-Miami Speedway.

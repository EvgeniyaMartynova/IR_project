Title: 1973–74 Iraqi Central FA Cup
Aspects: {'FA Cup (disambiguation)'}

The 1973–74 Iraqi Central FA Cup was the first and only edition of the Iraqi Central FA Cup, the primary knockout tournament for teams in central Iraq (i.e. the capital city of Baghdad). It was held alongside the 1973–74 Iraqi Central League but only lasted one season as the Iraq Football Association replaced regional tournaments with national tournaments, with the Iraq FA Cup becoming the primary knockout tournament in Iraqi football. The tournament was won by Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, beating Al-Sikak Al-Hadeed 2–1 in the final. Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya also won the 1973–74 Iraqi Central League to become the first and only team to complete a Central League and Central FA Cup double.

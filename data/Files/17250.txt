== Plot ==
In 1870, a shipment of $100,000 being transported by stagecoach to Galveston, Texas, is the object of a tug-of-war in the desert between Zack Thomas (Sinatra) and Joe Jarrett (Martin), who first must stave off an outlaw band led by Matson (Bronson).
Later, in Galveston, Thomas and Jarrett become rivals in a bid to open a waterfront casino. Each has a new romantic attachment, as well, with the beauties Elya (Anita Ekberg) and Maxine (Ursula Andress), respectively. They eventually must join forces to hold off the villainous Matson and a corrupt banker, Burden (Victor Buono), to keep their new gambling boat afloat.

== Production ==
Adlrich announced the film in November 1960 as Two for Texas, from a script by Teddy Sherman. The proposed stars were Lisa Kirk, Martine Carol and Aldo Ray.In January 1963, Dean Martin signed to make the film. At that stage his female co-stars would be Anita Ekberg and (it was hoped) Gina Lollobrigida. Warners, who had just made Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? with Aldrich, agreed to finance.In March, Frank Sinatra agreed to co star. This meant the film would be a co-production between Warners, Aldrich's company, the Associates and Aldrich, Martin's company, Claude Productions, and Sinatra's, Essex Productions.At one stage the role of Elya was originally intended for Sophia Loren, who had already worked with Sinatra in The Pride and the Passion. Although she was offered $1,000,000 for four weeks of work, Loren turned the part down.Lollobrigida decided not to do the film. In May, Ursula Andress joined the cast and the film was retitled Four for Texas.Aldrich later said he wrote the first draft of the script but "you could change that over and over and it was still a disaster."

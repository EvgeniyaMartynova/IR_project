Title: Fussilat
Aspects: {'Q41'}

Fuṣṣilat (Arabic: فصلت‎, "Explained In Detail"), also known as Sūrat Ḥā Mīm as-Sajdah (Arabic: سورة ﺣﻢ ﺍﻟﺴﺠﺪﺓ‎), is the 41st chapter (surah) of the Qur'an with 54 verses (ayat).
Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbāb al-nuzūl), it is an earlier "Meccan surah", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.

Title: Dutch Harrison
Aspects: {'E. J. Harrison'}

Ernest Joseph (E. J.) "Dutch" Harrison (March 29, 1910 – June 19, 1982) was an American professional golfer whose career spanned over four decades—one of the longest in the history of the PGA Tour.Born in Conway, Arkansas and nicknamed "The Arkansas Traveler", Harrison turned pro in 1930 at the start of the Great Depression. Although he played in what tournaments existed in those days, the mainstay of his income was the many exhibitions and private "money" matches in which he, as well as many of his fellow professionals, played.Harrison had a total of 18 career victories spanning from the 1939 Bing Crosby Pro-Am to the 1958 Tijuana Open Invitational. However, as late as 1969, Harrison had a top-25 finish in the Canadian Open at the age of 59. He played on three Ryder Cup teams: 1947, 1949, and 1951.
Harrison finished nine times in the top-10 at major championships, including third place finishes at the PGA Championship in 1939 and the U.S. Open in 1960. He won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average in 1954, and ranks fifth on the list of players with the most PGA Tour victories without a major championship on his resume.
In 1954 Harrison became the Old Warson Country Club's first golf professional. He died of heart failure at age 72 in 1982 in St. Louis, Missouri.

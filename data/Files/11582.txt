Kowalski has had a lifelong interest in astronomy with an emphasis on planetary science. As an amateur in Florida during the 1990s he developed an interest in astrometric and photometric observations of asteroids. He started the "Minor Planet Mailing List" in mid-1997. Kowalski discovered 14627 Emilkowalski in 1998.In 1999 he was invited to use the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's 0.6-m Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope to make observations in support of the Deep Space 1 mission. Also in 1999 he was the Scientific Coordinator for the first Minor Planet Amateur-Professional Workshop at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.

On October 6, 2008, while observing with the CSS 1.5 meter (60") telescope at Mount Lemmon Observatory, he discovered 2008 TC3. Approximately 20 hours after its discovery this asteroid entered the Earth's atmosphere over Sudan, becoming the first asteroid discovered before impact with the earth. Kowalski was honored with a small piece of 2008 TC3.On January 1, 2014 Kowalski found another impacting asteroid, this was designated 2014 AA.

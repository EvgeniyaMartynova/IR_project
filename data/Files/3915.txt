Title: Farman F.70
Aspects: {'F70'}

The Farman F.70 was a 1920s French passenger and mail transport aircraft designed and built by the Farman Aviation Works. It was a smaller counterpart to the company's popular F.60 Goliath. The F.70 was an unequal-span two-bay biplane with a wooden fuselage and was powered by a Renault 12Fe piston engine. The pilot was seated in an open cockpit behind the nose-mounted engine.  Behind the open cockpit was a cabin for four passengers or freight.
The aircraft could be fitted with a Gnome-Rhône Jupiter 9Aa radial engine and was then designated the Farman F.73. An experimental three-seat bomber variant was built but did not go into production.
Several aircraft of this series entered service with French airlines in the 1920s. The main operator was Farman's own airline Lignes Farman who operated five aircraft between Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. Lignes Aeriennes Latécoère used the aircraft to operate passenger and mail routes between Casablanca and Dakar and also from Algiers to Biskra. Other operators used the aircraft on French internal routes. The Polish operator Aero acquired five F.70s in 1925.

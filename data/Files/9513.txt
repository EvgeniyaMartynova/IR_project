Title: Osmia californica
Aspects: {'O. californica'}

Osmia californica is a megachilid bee, or mason bee. Native to North America, the mason bees are important pollinators.  O. californica generally emerges a little later in the spring than the better known orchard mason bee (O. lignaria).  Like the orchard mason bee, O. californica is a solitary nester.

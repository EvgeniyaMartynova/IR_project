Title: Leverett J-function
Aspects: {'J-function'}

In petroleum engineering, the Leverett J-function is a dimensionless function of water saturation describing the capillary pressure,

  
    
      
        J
        (
        
          S
          
            w
          
        
        )
        =
        
          
            
              
                p
                
                  c
                
              
              (
              
                S
                
                  w
                
              
              )
              
                
                  k
                  
                    /
                  
                  ϕ

              ⁡

    {\displaystyle J(S_{w})={\frac {p_{c}(S_{w}){\sqrt {k/\phi }}}{\gamma \cos \theta }}}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          S
          
            w
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S_{w}}
   is the water saturation measured as a fraction, 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{c}}
   is the capillary pressure (in pascal), 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is the permeability (measured in m²), 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   is the porosity (0-1), 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   is the surface tension (in N/m) and 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   is the contact angle.  The function is important in that it is constant for a given saturation within a reservoir, thus relating reservoir properties for neighboring beds.
The Leverett J-function is an attempt at extrapolating capillary pressure data for a given rock to rocks that are similar but with differing permeability, porosity and wetting properties. It assumes that the porous rock can be modelled as a bundle of non-connecting capillary tubes, where the factor 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
            
              /
            
            ϕ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {k/\phi }}}
   is a characteristic length of the capillaries' radii.
This function is also widely used in modeling two-phase flow of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. A large degree of hydration is needed for good proton conductivity while large liquid water saturation in pores of catalyst layer or diffusion media will impede gas transport in the cathode.

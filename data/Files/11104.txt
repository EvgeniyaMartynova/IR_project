Title: As-Saff
Aspects: {'Q61'}

Sūrat aṣ-Ṣaff (Arabic: سورة الصف‎, "The Ranks, Battle Array") is the 61st chapter (sura) of the Quran with 14 verses. This sura is a Al-Musabbihat sura because it begins with the glorification of Allah.


== Hadith about Surah As-Saff ==
The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad. Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Qur'an, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Qur'an. Ḥadīth (حديث) is literally "speech" or "report", that is a recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah. According to Aishah, the life of Muhammad was practical implementation of Qur'an. Therefore, mention in hadith elevates the importance of the pertinent surah from a certain perspective.

Abdullah ibn Salam narrated: “A group of us Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat talking, and we said: ‘If we knew which deed was most beloved to Alllah then we would do it.’ So Allah, Most High, revealed: Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah. And He is Almighty, the All-Wise. O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do? As-Saff (1-2)”...

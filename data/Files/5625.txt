Title: I Can't Help It (Bananarama song)
Aspects: {"I Can't Help It"}

"I Can't Help It" is a song written and recorded by English girl group Bananarama.  It is included on their fourth studio album Wow! and was released as its third single except in the U.S., where it was the album's second single (following "I Heard a Rumour") and Australia, where it was the album's fourth single (after "I Want You Back").  The track was co-written and produced by the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) trio.
The song is a disco-influenced pop tune similar to many hits produced by SAW during this time period
The single peaked at number 20 in the UK singles chart,  #27 on the Australian ARIA chart (where it was released in August 1988), and #47 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. A hit in nightclubs, "I Can't Help It" climbed to number seven on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart.
This is the final Bananarama single to feature Siobhan Fahey, who announced her departure shortly after its release.
The photos on the record sleeve were taken by famous American photographer Herb Ritts. The record sleeves for "I Can't Help It" and "Love In The First Degree" were switched with each other for the UK and North American markets.

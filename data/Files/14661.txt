== Plot ==
Singamuthu aka Singam is a person who lives as a temporary driver in Rishikesh, Uttranchal. Annamalai is the owner of Annamalai Transports but not the building-cum-residence of the transports and the staff. He is very innocent and funny. Vivek always arranges a marriage bride for himself but in one way or another Sundhar C. will stop the marriage. Anjali is an ardent fan of MGR and she feels her husband should also be like him. She is the very beautiful and attractive daughter of the Annamalai Transport building owner and she comes to Rishikesh to check the building's condition and to collect the yearly rent. She meets Sundhar C. and falls in love. Sundhar C. also falls in love with Anjali and reveals his past to her. Sundar C. was a highly accomplished district collector  and was transferred to Tanjore. He gets himself in a cat-and-mouse chase with local goon Naachiyaar. Naachiyaar's son kidnaps Sundhar C.'s friend's sister who was engaged to another man & tries to rape her. But Sundhar C. comes in and saves the girl and destroys Naachiyaar's son's reproductive capacity. Naachiyaar's son dies in hospital. The marriage of the girl happens happily. Naachiyaar kills Sundhar C.'s friend brutally for revenge. Then the governor comes to Tanjore and CBCID informs that an attempt will be made on governor's life at a Tanjore meeting. Sundhar C. is told to protect the governor as he trained for IPS first and was an excellent shooter. But the governor is killed and Sundhar C. is framed by the DGP himself. The rest of the film shows how Sundhar C. proves himself (he does) and again stops another marriage of Vivek after returning to being a collector.

Title: List of British weapon L numbers
Aspects: {'L number'}

This is a listing of British Armed Forces weapons and related stores identified by their L number designation ("L" standing for Land Service). The L number in isolation is not a unique identifier; the L1 designation alone is used for a rifle and its corresponding bayonet, a machine gun, a tank gun, a sighting telescope, an anti-riot grenade, and two separate rocket systems. Rather, the number is used in conjunction with a description, e.g. "Rifle, 7.62mm, L1A1" or "L1A1 7.62mm Rifle". The A number following the L number refers to the particular version of a piece of equipment; unlike some similar designation systems used by other countries where an A number is only used for subsequent versions of equipment, an A1 designation is always used for the first version to be officially adopted. Use of L numbers starts in the 1950s and an equivalent system for military vehicles is the FV series (fighting vehicle). On occasion, the number following the letter designation corresponds to the year that the item was adopted; for example, the rifle variant of the SA80 was first adopted in 1985 and was designated as the "L85 5.56mm Rifle".
Some weapons such as the M18A1 Claymore, M79 grenade launcher and M6-895 and M6-640 mortars were not given L numbers and are referred to in official documentation by their manufacturer's designations instead. Likewise, legacy items such as the No.8 Mk 1 Rifle that were given designations under the old numerical system continued to be referred to by those designations until replacement.
Royal Navy weapons systems are designated by "N" ("N" standing for Naval Service), though in many cases weapons with L number designations continue to be referred to as such. Similar designation systems are used by other militaries; for example, Canada uses "C" ("C" standing for Canadian), Australia uses "F" ("F" standing for Forces), and the United States of America use "M" ("M" standing for Model).

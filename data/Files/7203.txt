Title: K-19 (Kansas highway)
Aspects: {'K19'}

K-19 is a 33.915-mile-long (54.581 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas. From U.S. Route 50 (US-50) to K-19 Spur it is signed as north–south and from K-19 Spur to US-281 it is signed as east–west. K-19's southern terminus is at US-50 in Belpre, and the eastern terminus is at US-281 east of Seward. When K-19 was first designated in 1927, it started in Belpre and ended in Larned.


== Route description ==
K-19 runs north–south for its first 15.1 miles (24.3 km), and east–west for its final 18.8 miles (30.3 km). The first leg begins at US-50 in Belpre and near the Arkansas River south of Larned, K-19 turns east for its second leg, bypassing both Radium and Seward to the south before ending at US-281.K-19 begins at US-50 in Belpre and shortly crosses an Amtrak track then leaves Belpre. It then continues northward for 3 miles (4.8 km) through flat rural farmlands before entering into Pawnee County. Approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) north of the county line it crosses Pickle Creek, a tributary of the Arkansas River, and passes Zook. From there it continues northward for roughly 7 miles (11 km) then reaches the terminus of K-19 Spur. At this point it is redesignated as an east–west route. K-19 Spur crosses the Arkansas River and ends about 0.8 miles (1.3 km) later at US-56 in Larned.From K-19 Spur, K-19 travels eastward for about 5.5 miles (8.9 km) before crossing Pickle Creek again. From there it continues eastward for roughly another 4.5 miles (7.2 km) and crosses into Stafford County, traveling south of Radium 1 mile (1.6 km) after crossing the county line. After roughly another 5.5 miles (8.9 km) it reaches the terminus of the former K-219, a .995-mile-long (1.601 km) spur that served Seward until it was decommissioned in 2013. It then continues another 2.5 miles (4.0 km) and reaches its eastern terminus at US-281.K-19 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-19 does connect to the National Highway System at each terminus, US-50 and US-281, as well as to US-56 via K-19 Spur. 2017 Annual average daily traffic (AADT) on K-19 ranged from 540 at the terminus of former K-219 to 1390 slightly south of the terminus of K-19 Spur.


== History ==
K-19 was first designated by KDOT in 1927, and at that time ran from US-50S in Belpre northward to US-50N in Larned. Also at that time the segment from K-19 Spur eastward to then K-8 was designated as K-37. By 1932 the K-37 designation was removed and K-19 was extended to K-8 which later became US-281. In 1956, K-19 was extended .4 miles (640 m) southward in Edwards County when US-50, at the time US-50S, was slightly realigned within Belpre. In Pawnee County, K-19 was slightly realigned just south of K-19 Spur to eliminate some sharp 
curves.In Stafford County, K-19 originally turned north on present day Radium Road towards Radium, then followed NW 150th Street east to end at US-281, passing just to the south of Seward along the way. In a September 25, 1946 resolution, the turn to the north at Radium Road was eliminated and K-19 was realigned to continue eastward to its current eastern terminus.

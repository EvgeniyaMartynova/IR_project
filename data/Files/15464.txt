== Distinction from News Exchanges ==
The News Xchange conference (which has no 'E' at the start of Xchange) is distinct from Eurovision News Exchanges (with an 'E'); though the two are sometimes confused. Daily News Exchanges are organized by Eurovision on behalf of members of the European Broadcasting Union. News Xchange conference has no direct connection with these Exchanges and is open to all organizations and individuals involved in broadcast news.

Title: The Cult of Ray
Aspects: {"I Don't Want to Hurt You"}

The Cult of Ray is a 1996 album by Frank Black (also known as Black Francis.) It is his third solo album released after the initial breakup of the Pixies. Unlike his previous two albums, which had been produced by former Pere Ubu keyboardist Eric Drew Feldman, Black opted to produce this one himself.
The album title is a reference to science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury. The album's final song is a tribute to Shazeb Andleeb, who was beaten to death at Narbonne High School in Harbor City, California (a school Black attended), in May 1995.

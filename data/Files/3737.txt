=== M2 Coupé (F87) ===

The M2 was first revealed in Need for Speed: No Limits on November 2015, before later premiering at the North American International Auto Show in January 2016. Production commenced in October 2015 and is only available as a rear-wheel drive coupé.The M2 is powered by the turbocharged 3.0-litre N55B30T0 straight-six engine producing 272 kW (365 hp) at 6,500 rpm and 465 N⋅m (343 lb⋅ft) between 1,450–4,750 rpm, while an overboost function temporarily increases torque to 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft). The M2 features pistons from the F80 M3 and F82 M4, and has lighter aluminium front and rear suspension components resulting in a 5 kg (11 lb) weight reduction. The M2 is available with a 6-speed manual or with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission which features a 'Smokey Burnout' mode. 0-100 km/h acceleration times are 4.5 seconds manual transmission models and 4.3 seconds for models equipped with the 7-speed dual clutch transmission. Top speed is limited to 250 km/h (155 mph) but can be extended to 270 km/h (168 mph) with the optional M Driver's package.The M2 was used as a safety car in the 2016 MotoGP season.


=== M2 Coupé Competition (F87) ===

The M2 Competition was introduced at the 2018 Beijing Auto Show and succeeded the standard M2 Coupé. Production began in July 2018.The M2 Competition uses the high performance S55 engine which is a variant of the 3.0-litre twin turbocharged straight six engine found in the F80 M3 and F82 M4. The engine features a redesigned oil supply system and modified cooling system from the BMW M4 with the Competition Package, and also features a gasoline particulate filter in certain European Union countries to reduce emissions. Compared to the standard M2, the S55 produces an additional 30 kW (40 hp) and 85 N⋅m (63 lb⋅ft), resulting in a larger and more sustained power output of 302 kW (405 hp) between 5,370–7,200 rpm, and 550 N⋅m (406 lb⋅ft) at 2,350–5,230 rpm. The 0-100 km/h acceleration time is 4.4 seconds for six-speed manual transmission models, and 4.2 seconds for models with the 7-speed dual clutch transmission. Top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), but the M Driver's package can extend the limit to 280 km/h (174 mph) which is 10 km/h (6 mph) further than in the M2.The M2 Competition also has a carbon-fibre reinforced plastic strut bar, enlarged kidney grilles, and larger brake discs of 400 mm (15.7 in) in the front axle and 380 mm (15.0 in) in the rear axle. Because of the new engine and cooling system, the M2 Competition is 55 kg (121 lb) heavier than the standard M2 at 1,550 kg (3,417 lb) for manual transmission models and 1,575 kg (3,472 lb) for dual-clutch transmission models.


=== M2 Coupé CS (F87) ===
The M2 CS was revealed in November 2019 prior to its upcoming introduction at the LA Auto Show. Production will begin in March 2020, with 2,200 units planned.The M2 CS uses the same engine as the F82 M4 CS, a more powerful version of the S55 which produces 331 kW (444 hp) and 550 N⋅m (406 lb⋅ft). The 0-100 km/h acceleration time is 4.0 seconds for six-speed manual transmission models, and 3.8 seconds for models with the 7-speed dual clutch transmission. 
The rotors and calipers are carried over from the M2 Competition, but ceramic brakes are newly available as an option. An adaptive M suspension is standard along with an electronic locking differential. The wheel hubs and control arms are made from forged aluminium, with a carbon-fibre transmission tunnel as an additional weight-saving measure. The hood, roof and various aerodynamic parts are made of a carbon-fibre composite. The active exhaust system is new as well, and unique wheel designs in high-gloss Jet black or matte gold finishes differentiate it from other M2 models; Michelin Cup 2 tires are also available. Inside, the center console is also carbon-fibre, with Alcantara trim and an embroidered red "CS" badge; the seats are leather and Alcantara with red contrast stitching and are complemented by contrast-stitched Alcantara on the steering wheel.


=== M235i Racing ===

The M235i Racing is a track version of the 2 Series developed by the BMW Motorsport division and was produced from 2014 to 2018. It was aimed at amateur drivers due to its relatively lower price and addition of driver aids such as anti-lock brakes, traction control, and dynamic stability control. The M235i Racing uses an 8-speed automatic transmission and features a modified version of the N55B30O0 engine found in the standard M235i, and produces 245 kW (329 hp) at 5,800–6,000 rpm and 450 N⋅m (332 lb⋅ft) at 1,300–4,500 rpm. The M235i Racing also features a mechanical limited-slip differential and larger brakes and springs. The front and rear spoilers, diffuser, and wing mirrors are from the BMW M Performance Parts catalog. The car was used in the BMW M235i Racing Cup which was part of the VLN Endurance Championship at the Nürburgring. It was also sold to customer teams in other championships such as the 24H Series, Touring Car Endurance Series, and Pirelli World Challenge.M235i Racing models can be upgraded to the M240i Racing Evo through the installation of the Evo package, for use in the current M240i Racing Cup. M240i Evo models feature revised spoiler end plates, updated engine software, and an optional newly designed driver's seat. The M240i Evo has the same power output of 245 kW (329 hp), but produces an additional 10 N⋅m (7 lb⋅ft) at 460 N⋅m (339 lb⋅ft).

Title: Kaali, Estonia
Aspects: {'Kaali'}

Kaali is a village in Saaremaa Parish, Saare County in western Estonia, 18 kilometres (11 mi) from Kuressaare, the island capital. Valjala, to the north-east, is the nearest town.
The village is the site of the Kaali crater, actually a series of craters formed by meteorite impacts more than 4,000 years ago. The main crater has become well-known and is now a popular tourist destination. Supporting a museum, cafeteria, shop, and hotel, the crater has led to tourism becoming an important part of Kaali's economy.
Before the administrative reform in 2017, the village was in Pihtla Parish.

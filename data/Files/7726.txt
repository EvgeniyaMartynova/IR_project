Title: Larimichthys crocea
Aspects: {'L. crocea'}

Larimichthys crocea, called the  large yellow croaker, the yellow croaker or the croceine croaker, is a species of marine fish in the croaker family (Sciaenidae) native to the northwestern Pacific, generally in temperate waters such as the Taiwan Strait. It lives in coastal waters and estuaries, often in brackish water also, and is found on muddy-sandy bottoms. Males can reach 80 cm, but a common size is 60 cm.
Once an abundant commercial fish off China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan, its population collapsed in the 1970s due to overfishing. Fishing boats landed 56,000 tonnes of Larimichthys crocea in 2008, and 91,000 tonnes in 2013. The species is now aquafarmed in China, and production has grown to 105,000 tonnes by 2013. Farms have experienced outbreaks of Nocardia seriolae infections.
L. crocea is an important enough commercial species to have its genome mapped in 2014. On 6 January 2015 it became the 200th organism to have its genome annotated by the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline.

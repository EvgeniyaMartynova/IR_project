Title: Schneider Kreuznach
Aspects: {'B&W'}

Schneider Kreuznach (German pronunciation: [ˌʃnaɪdɐ ˈkʁɔʏtsnax]) is the abbreviated name of the company Jos. Schneider Optische Werke GmbH, which is sometimes also simply referred to as Schneider.  They are a manufacturer of industrial and photographic optics. The company was founded on 18 January 1913 by Joseph Schneider as Optische Anstalt Jos. Schneider &  Co. at Bad Kreuznach in Germany. The company changed its name to Jos. Schneider & Co., Optische Werke, Kreuznach in 1922, and to the current Jos. Schneider Optische Werke GmbH in 1998.
In 2001, Schneider received an Oscar for Technical Achievement for their Super-Cinelux motion picture lenses. It is best known as manufacturers of large format lenses for view cameras, enlarger lenses, and photographic loupes. It also makes a limited amount of small- and medium-format lenses, and has at various times manufactured eyeglasses and camera rangefinders, as well as being an OEM lens maker for Kodak and Samsung digital cameras. It has  supplied the lenses for various LG devices and the BlackBerry Priv. It also supplied the lenses for the Kodak Regent camera in the 1930s and other classic cameras such as certain models of the Rolleiflex starting in the 1940s, the Kodak Retina and Kodak Retinette camera series in the 1950s and 1960s, and certain specialty lenses for Hasselblad. In 1961, It created Feinwerktechnik GmbH, a manufacturer of electrical-hydraulic servo valves.
In recent years, it has acquired several other companies:

In 1985, it acquired the B+W Filter Manufacturing Company (founded in 1947 by partners Biermann and Weber), maker of the line of B+W filters. 
In July 1987, it purchased Rollei Fototechnic GmbH.
In 1989, it purchased Käsemann/Oberaudorf, a manufacturer of glass and plastic polarizing materials.
After 1991 it acquired the former East-German (GDR) camera and lens manufacturer Pentacon/Practica (Dresden)
In 2000, it acquired Century Optics, an American lensmaking firm.From the start of its production in 1914, Schneider had produced their 500,000th lens by June 1932, its millionth by November 1936, and its 10 millionth lens by January 1967. As of April 2000, it had produced over 14,730,000 lenses. The list below converts any cm designations on earlier lenses to mm (so a 16.5 cm lens is shown as a 165 mm lens).

=== Xenar ===
The Xenar uses a Tessar type optical formula, originally designed by Paul Rudolph for Zeiss (4 elements in 3 groups, with the rear element consisting of a cemented doublet). The formula could only be used by Schneider Kreuznach after the original 1902 Tessar patent had expired in 1919. Many other famous lenses with large production runs were based on this formula (e.g. Leitz Elmar, Voigtländer Skopar, Kodak Ektar).

== Large format lenses ==
Schneider's line of large format lenses has a reputation for high-quality construction and durability, and all lenses carry a lifetime warranty.  Some of the higher-end lenses of the Schneider line are among the most expensive optics available in large format photography.


=== Angulon ===
Introduced in 1930, the Angulon is the original Schneider wide-angle lens line. It is a 6-element, 2-group, symmetric anastigmat design somewhat related to the Goerz Dagor. Compared to many modern wide angles, they are quite compact, though the angle of coverage is only 80°, although an early catalogue from 1934 lists this series as having an angle of view of 105° (it is unclear as to the test-conditions or what is deemed an acceptable result). They are color-corrected reasonably well, but suffer from significant softening of the image close to the edge of the circle of illumination. Only the outer elements are supported by the mount, the inner elements are mounted by cementing to the outer elements. For this reason they are prone to "slippage", especially if stored "on end" in hot climates.

165mm f/6.8 (for 8x10")
210mm f/6.8 (for 10x12")A catalogue from 1934 also proclaims the Angulon f/6.8 series as a convertible anastigmat: "...the components of which can be used separately and give two different foci". When the elements are used separately, their focal lengths are approximately x1.5 for the Rear and x2 for the Front, the narrower aperture results in the need for 2x and 4x longer exposures, respectively.

90mm Rear 140mm, Front 185mm (for 4x5")
120mm Rear 185mm, Front 250mm (for 5x7")
165mm Rear 260mm, Front 345mm (for 8x10")
210mm Rear 330mm, Front 430mm (for 10x12")


=== Super-Angulon ===

These are wide-angle lenses which have been developed in several steps.  The Super-Angulons are Biogon designs, making for huge, heavy lenses, but also giving very generous angles of coverage.  The f/4 lenses give 95° of coverage, the f/8 models give 100°, and the f/5.6 units give a 105° coverage angle.  The f/4 and f/5.6 lenses are 8-element, 4-group designs, while the f/8 lenses are older 6-element, 4-group, symmetrical designs.  Coating technologies improved along the production life of these lenses, and recent Super-Angulons are multicoated.

90mm f/5.6 (110°)


=== Symmar ===
The Symmar is one of the original Schneider designs, introduced in 1920, and is still relevant and used today. They have a 6-element, 4-group, symmetric design, and give a 70° angle of coverage. The f/5.6 series of lenses are "convertible", meaning that by removing one of the lens cells the user creates a 3 element lens of longer focal length than the complete lens. The resulting 3 element lens has a narrower aperture of f/12 and an angle of view of 40°. These lenses have two aperture markings, one in white for the complete lens and one in green for the converted lens. When "converted" the resulting 3 element lens will produce softer images than the complete lens.

=== Symmar-S ===
The Symmar-S is an incremental improvement to the original Symmar design, adding multicoating to the feature set.  The lens is not symmetric like its predecessor and is not convertible. The available focal lengths are slightly different, with the subtraction of the 80 mm, and addition of a 120 mm and two 480 mm lenses of varying speeds.

=== Apo-Symmar ===
This is a 6-element, 4-group apochromatic lens design, which has since been replaced by the Apo-Symmar L-Series.  Using low-dispersion glass and multicoating techniques, secondary-spectrum reflections have been greatly reduced.  The Apo-Symmar lenses up to 360 mm have a 72° angle of coverage, and the 480 mm lenses give a 56° angle.

=== Tele-Xenar ===
An inexpensive 4-element, 2-group telephoto lens design featuring 35° of coverage.  The 1000 mm lenses, by comparison, give only an 18° angle of coverage, but require even less focal distance than other telephoto designs (slightly more than 1/2 the effective focal length, as opposed to about 2/3 for a normal tele lens).

=== Apo-Tele-Xenar ===
These are apochromatic telephoto lenses using a 5-element variation of the Tele-Xenar design.  They can be used on subjects as close as 2 meters without a loss of resolution, and are painted a non-reflective flat grey to reduce thermal absorption and expansion under sunlight or hot studio lights. The 400 mm Compact model is half the length and 70% the weight of the normal Apo-Tele-Xenar 400 mm lens. The 350 mm compact model is actually not a tele-design but a dialyte; however it is called the Apo Tele Xenar 350 Compact .

=== Fine-Art XXL ===
The Fine-Art XXL line is designed for ultra-large format shooting, covering 20×24 inches.  Both lenses are large and heavy, but are designed with exceptional image quality and a huge 900 mm circle of coverage in mind.  The 550 mm lens is a 6/2 construction, giving 78° of coverage, while the 1100 mm lens is 4/4 with 45.7° of coverage.  Both lenses are mounted in a Copal 3 shutter, and the longer lens is also available in a barrel mount with Waterhouse stops, if the faster f/14 version is desired.

Aspects: {'U.S. Customhouse'}

The United States Customs House is a custom house at 610 S. Canal Street in the Near West Side neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The building opened in 1933 to meet the city's need for a larger custom house, especially with the large Chicago Main Post Office opening nearby. Two architecture firms, the Burnham Brothers and Nimmons, Carr & Wright, designed the Classical Moderne building. The building's design includes vertical columns of windows divided by pilasters, a black granite entrance surround and base, and a parapet with a bas-relief eagle on either side. While the building was originally seven stories tall, an additional four stories and a new penthouse were added in 1940.The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 2016.

Title: Fuscocerrena
Aspects: {'F. portoricensis'}

Fuscocerrena is a fungal genus in the family Polyporaceae. It is a monotypic genus, containing the single polypore species Fuscocerrena portoricensis, found in eastern North America, Central America, and South America.


== Taxonomy ==
Fuscocerrena was circumscribed by Norwegian mycologist Leif Ryvarden in 1982 to contain the fungus originally described by Elias Fries as Polyporus portoricensis. This species was also previously placed in Cerrenella, a genus proposed by William Murrill in 1905, but later abandoned.


== Description ==
The genus is characterized by its irregular fruit body that when fresh is farinose (covered by a white, mealy powder) and greenish white in colour; older fruit bodies become dark brown. Microscopically, the fungus features a dimitic hyphal system, generative hyphae with clamp connections, and dendrohyphidia (small, spiderweb-like hyphae)–a characteristic, which although common in the family Corticiaceae, is seldom encountered in the Polyporaceae. The spores of Fuscocerrena portoricensis are hyaline, cylindrical, and non-amyloid, measuring 5–7 by 2–2.5 μm.


== Habitat and distribution ==
Fuscocerrena portoricensis is found in eastern North America, Central America, and South America, and has also been collected in Cuba and Jamaica. It grows on decomposing deciduous wood.

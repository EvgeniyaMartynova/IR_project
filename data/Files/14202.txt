Title: V (Live album)
Aspects: {'V Live'}

V is the 6th studio album by the band Live, released in 2001. It featured the singles "Simple Creed" and "Overcome", the latter of which received significant exposure following the September 11 attacks.


== History ==
The collection of songs that became V was never intended to be released as an album. Guitarist Chad Taylor said, "The goal was to prepare songs for the next studio session. MCA got a hold of the material and pushed us to call it an album." The songs were originally going to be released free to fans as a collection called Ecstatic Fanatic. V only reached number 22 on the album chart in the US and failed to attain gold status, despite reasonably positive reviews. The bonus track, a remix of "Deep Enough", was featured in the movie The Fast and the Furious. The song Forever May Not Be Long Enough plays over the closing credits of the 2001 film The Mummy Returns and is included on the film's soundtrack album.

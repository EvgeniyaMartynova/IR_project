Title: Zabala (Sumer)
Aspects: {'Zabala'}

Zabala (also Zabalam, modern Tell Ibzeikh, Dhi Qar Governorate, Iraq) was a city of ancient Sumer in what is now the Dhi Qar governorate in Iraq. Zabala was at the crossing of the ancient Iturungal and
Ninagina canals. The city's deity was Inanna of Zabala.


== History ==
The first mentions of Zabala are in seals from the Jemdet Nasr period including a list of early sites - Ur, Nippur, Larsa, Uruk, Kes, and Zabalam. The earliest historical record, a bowl inscription, indicates that Zabala was under the control of Lugalzagesi of Lagash.
In the Sargonic Period, Shar-kali-sharri and Naram-Sin both
reported building a temple to the goddess Inanna in Zabala
 and Rimush of Akkad reports
Zabala as attempting to rebel against the control of the Akkadian Empire. After the
fall of Akkad, Zabala came into the sphere of the city-state of Isin as reported
by the year names of several rulers including Itar-pisa and Ur-Ninurta.
The town was later subject to
Abisare of Larsa, who's year name reported the building of the
"Favorite of Inanna of Zabalam" canal.
During the Ur III period, Zabala was controlled by the Ur governor in Umma
which was the capital of Umma Province.
Cuneiform texts state that Hammurabi built Zabala's temple Ezi-Kalam-ma to the goddess Innana.
The temple of Inanna in Zabalam is the subject of hymn 26 in the temple hymns of Enheduanna.


== Archaeology ==
Beginning in the early 1900s, a great deal of illegal excavation occurred in Zabala. One of the oldest known extant examples of writing was removed from Zabala during this period. This
activity reached a new height in the 1990s, at which time the Iraqi State Organization of Antiquities and Heritage appears to have authorized an official excavation, the
first at the site. It is not
clear that the results were ever published. A further outbreak of archaeological looting
at Zabala broke out after the 2003 War in Iraq.

Title: L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre
Aspects: {"L'Hospitalet"}

L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre (L'Espitalet in Occitan) is a commune in the Ariège department of southwestern France. L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre literally translates to "The Hospital Near Andorra".
The area has a history of vulnerability to winter avalanches: one such in 1895 killed 12 (nearly 10% of the commune's population at the time), and much destruction was also caused in 1906 and 1929. Avalanches have from time to time cut the N20, the main road through the commune, the most recent case being in 2008.

The Gare d'Andorre - L'Hospitalet – served by TER Midi-Pyrénées regional trains between Toulouse and Latour-de-Carol and the overnight Intercités de nuit service between Paris and Latour-de-Carol – is an important international transport node for the nearby principality of Andorra, to which the station is connected by a bus link.

Title: BMW N63
Aspects: {'N63'}

The BMW N63 is a twin-turbo V8 petrol engine which has been in production from 2008 to present. The N63 is the world's first production car engine to use a "hot-vee" layout, with the turbochargers located inside the "V" of the engine. It is also BMW's first turbocharged V8 engine.
The N63 replaced the BMW N62 (a naturally aspirated V8 engine) and was first used in the 2008 X6 xDrive50i.The S63 engine is the BMW M high-performance version of the N63.
Alpina versions of the N63 are used in various F01 7 Series, F10 5 Series, G11 7 Series and G30 5 Series models.


== Design ==
The airflow path through the engine uses a "hot-vee" layout, where the exhaust manifolds and turbochargers are located between the cylinder banks (on the "inside" of the V8) and the intake manifolds are located on the outside of the engine. This is opposite to the traditional layout for a V8, where the intake is inside the "V" and the exhaust manifold is on the outside. The hot-vee layout reduces the width of the engine and decreases the exhaust runner length from the exhaust valves to the turbochargers. The engine uses air-to-water intercoolers, therefore improving throttle response.Similar to the N54B30, initial N63 variants (including the S63) do not use Valvetronic (variable valve lift), because its benefit of reducing of intake vacuum is not as important in turbocharged engines. Due to the presence of turbocharging, the N63 does not use a variable-length intake manifold.
The N63 is BMW's first V8 engine to use direct injection.
The N63/S63 uses a bore of 89 mm (3.50 in) and a stroke of 88.3 mm (3.48 in) (except for the Chinese market 4.0 litre variant).


=== 2012 technical update ===
In 2012, a "Technical Update" was applied to the N63, resulting in the N63TU variants (also known as N63B44O1). The main upgrade was the addition of Valvetronic. Other changes include revised turbochargers, removal of the blowoff valve, lighter pistons, forged connecting rods and crankshaft, addition of a  valve cover labyrinth oil catch/return system, new valve stem seals, revised fuel system and addition of a second coolant pump.


=== 2016 technical update ===
A second Technical Update occurred in 2016, resulting in the N63TU2 variants (also known as N63B44O2). The major changes are the use of twin-scroll turbochargers, a wider powerband and the oil/coolant heat exchanger being moved to within the "V" of the engine.


=== 2018 technical update ===
A third Technical Update was introduced in 2018. Two variants are offered: N63B44M3 and N63B44T3. N63B44M3 features improved thermal shielding for the crankcase and the cylinder head, and a new ignition system. In addition, N63B44T3 uses higher pressure (5000psi) injectors, larger twin-scroll turbochargers, a redesigned intake manifold, and an upstream cooling radiator.

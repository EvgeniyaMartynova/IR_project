Title: Uppland Air Force Wing
Aspects: {'F16'}

Uppland Air Force Wing (Swedish: Upplands flygflottilj), also F 16 Uppsala, or simply F 16, is a Swedish air force base located just north of Uppsala on the east coast of Sweden. The air base was mainly used for fighter squadrons but has had no active squadrons since 2003.


== History ==
F 16 was established by buying farmland from Ärna gård and Bärby gård in 1943. The grass fields were used as runways for the air base that was founded in 1944.
The airbase was well outside the city limits of Uppsala at the time of the founding, but because of city growth, it later was adopted in as a suburb under the name Ärna as the population near the base and the city grew together.
The original emblem of F 16 was a golden sheaf of grain on a blue shield, but when F 2 Hägernäs airbase was decommissioned in 1974, F 16 took over its coat of arms of Uppland.
The Swedish government decided in 1996 that the air force wing with the squadrons would be decommissioned on December 31, 2003. The base is still active with various military schools.
The base was also home to F 20 Uppsala Air Force Academy.
The airfield is now known as Ärna or Uppsala Airport (ICAO: ESCM)

=== Colours, standards and guidons ===
The units last colour was presented to the wing at the Artillery Yard in Stockholm by the Supreme Commander, General Owe Wiktorin on 30 April 1996. It was handed over to the Uppsala Air Force Training schools (F 20) as a traditional colour when F 16 was disbanded on 31 December 2003. The colour is drawn by Ingrid Lamby and manufactured by machine in appliqué technique by the Engelbrektsson Flag factory. Blazon: "On blue cloth in the centre the badge of the Air Force; a winged two-bladed propeller under a royal crown proper. In the first corner the provincial badge of Uppland; an orb, banded and ensigned with a cross-crosslet and in the second corner a sevenpointed star (a legacy from seven disbanded wings: the former Västmanland Air Force Wing (F 1), Roslagen Air Force Wing (F 2), Östgöta Air Force Wing (F 3), Svea Air Force Wing (F 8), Södermanland Air Force Wing (F 11), Bråvalla Air Force Wing (F 13) and Södertörn Air Force Wing (F 18)). All décor in yellow.

=== Medals ===
In 2003, the Upplands flygflottiljs (F 16) minnesmedalj ("Uppland Air Force Wing (F 16) Commemorative Medal") in bronze (UpplffljBMM) of the 8th size was established. The medal ribbon is of blue moiré with a yellow stripe on the middle and a broad red stripe on each side. The wing coat of arms is attached to the ribbon.


== Commanding officers ==
From 1943 to 1981, the commanding officers was referred to as flottiljchef ("wing commander"), and had the rank of colonel. From 1981 to 1994, the wing commander was referred to as sektorflottiljchef ("sector wing commander") and had the rank of colonel 1st class. From 1994 to 2003, the commanding officer was again referred to as flottiljchef ("wing commander"), and had the rank of colonel.


=== Wing and sector wing commanders ===


=== Deputy sector wing commanders ===
In order to relieve the sector wing commander, a deputy sector wing commander position was added in 1981. Its task was to lead the unit procurement, a task largely similar to the old wing commander position. Hence he was also referred to as flottiljchef ("wing commander"). The deputy sector wing commander had the rank of colonel. On 30 June 1994, the deputy sector wing commander position was terminated.

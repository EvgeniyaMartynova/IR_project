Title: XDA Flame
Aspects: {'XDA'}

The XDA Flame is a Pocket PC device (also called PDA or Personal Digital Assistant) first released in May 2007, produced by Arima Communications and originally distributed by O2 Asia Pacific & Middle East. This device belongs to a wide O2 Xda device family, including XDA Atom, XDA Atom Life, XDA Zinc, XDA Orbit (aka HTC Artemis), XDA Stealth, XDA II Mini (aka HTC Magician), XDA IIs (aka HTC Blueangel), XDA II (aka HTC Himalaya) and XDA (aka HTC Wallaby). It is one of the first Pocket PC device that was enabled with 3D accelerated graphics nVidia's GoForce 5500 graphic processor (GPU). XDA Flame is also a 3G enabled phone (UMTS 2100 / GSM 900 / GSM 1800 / GSM 1900) with VGA touch screen, 2GB flash memory, 128MB RAM, Intel XScale PXA 270 520 MHz processor and integrated FM radio.


== Specifications ==
As of 2010, the specifications are these:


== Brief history ==
In May 2007, O2 Asia Pacific & Middle East released the XDA Flame. O2's cooperation with nVidia and CodeMonkeys allowed this company to advertise their new product easily, because there was a big demand on the market for a 3D graphics enabled PDA, with a lot of internal memory and many additional functions like USB On-The-Go and TV-out. However, at the end of 2007, O2 began to release new products and they stopped supporting this device, passing all copyrights to a new company called Mobile & Wireless Group (MWg). MWg has released XDA Flame under its own brand with Bluetooth 2.0. Many Flame owners felt a relief knowing that someone will still support their devices. Yet, after a half year, MWg resigned from further supporting this device on its main site and created O2 Asia Support where users can still get a support. In the near future Mwg is planning to release a Flame successor called Flame II  with probably Windows Phone 7.


== Device issues ==
XDA Flame has several software bugs. From the beginning MWg's support center have not released a new Windows Mobile 6 version since it appeared on the market.
After some time a class action lawsuit page was established to raise awareness of the problem, similar to HTC TyTN II case. In The Point, Tim Osborne wrote:

(...)"We as customers have the right to demand fixes and support for a device that retailed for around $1500 dollars (expensive to say the least). We will also investigate a possible class action suit against O2 / MWG for this as well as lack of support. The class action law suit will only be a last resort if all else fails and information is been seeked on such an action at the moment. We hope that MWG shows itself to be the leading edge company it promotes itself to be and this not be necessary. However as of yet we have had only vague promises of Windows Mobile 6 coming to this device. What we ask is that MWG/O2 do as promised and publicly announce that they will “attempt” to fix these issues and deliver Windows Mobile 6. We are all just looking to use what we purchased nothing more."(...)
Battling with the lack of support by MWG and nVidia, community users have repackaged many Windows Mobile ROM images by their own. After several months dealing with some issues (as sleeping beauty, which caused the device not to wake up from suspension; or a long-standing SDHC problem with Wifi), there have aroused stable and fully functionals ROMs including versions with Windows Mobile 6.1 and SDHC. As of October 2008, community driven support for the Geforce 5500 GPU is still improving but far from fully functional.


== Maintenance ==
Soft-resettingTo perform soft-reset on XDA Flame - put stylus in a hole next to a microphone.

Hard-resettingTo perform hard-reset on XDA Flame - while pressing Camera and Comm buttons (two buttons on the left and right at the bottom of the device) soft-reset device. When asked, user should press left soft-key (YES).


== OS updating ==
Operating system (OS) updating, which is also called flashing, is a process similar to installing a new Windows on a PC.
On PDAs, Windows Mobile "disk image" or "ROM image" (archive containing OS files) is installed in internal flash memory.
XDA Flame OS updating steps:

Micro SD card format (FAT, default cluster size).
Creating empty .txt file and renaming it to 1xdtgklo.kez.
Copying created .kez file and diskimage.nb0 (new ROM image) to a micro SD card.
Charging device battery over 50%.
While keeping pressed both soft key buttons (buttons at the top of keypad with a horizontal line), soft resetting PDA (buttons should be released after the appearing of a bootloader screen).
Waiting for the device to finish and soft-reset itself.

== Registry tweaks ==
Windows Mobile, like any Windows version, has a Windows registry. Tweaking a registry refers to changing registry entries so that many OS functions will work differently. It's commonly used among Pocket PC users to get the best performance from devices and to get to OS hidden settings.
Known tools for Pocket PC registry editing:

Total Commander
Resco Explorer (requires add-in)
Regedit
SKToolsWM registry hives:

HKEY LOCAL MACHINE (HKLM) - this is the main key with all internal device and WM functions. There are all settings connected with drivers, services, connections, installed software, OS design and general data flow.
HKEY CURRENT USER (HKCU) - this is the key with installed software settings and OS predefined values. There are standard user settings which can also be found in WM user interface.
HKEY CLASSES ROOT (HKCR) - this is the main core of WM services, files and application - data flow. In this key user can connect file extensions with programs that should use these files. There can also be found Soft Input Panel and other hard coded system applications.Editing WM registry steps:

Navigation to the proper registry entry.
Changing its value / creating a new one.
Acceptance of all made changes and suspending device for about 30–40 seconds.
Soft resetting device.Most registry entries can be changed by using special .cab files. Those can be made with the help of WinCE CAB Manager for PC (for example). An option that allows user to uninstall such cab file should be unchecked.
The second option for quick registry entries import is through .reg files. Those are standard .txt files saved in Unicode that can be pasted in Total Commander or imported in Resco Explorer.

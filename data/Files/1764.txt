Title: Ceriodaphnia dubia
Aspects: {'C. dubia'}

Ceriodaphnia dubia is a species of water flea in the class Branchiopoda, living in freshwater lakes, ponds, and marshes in most of the world. They are small, generally less than 1 millimetre (0.039 in) in length. Males are smaller than females. Ceriodaphnia dubia move by using a powerful set of second antennae. Ceriodaphnia dubia is used in toxicity testing of wastewater treatment plant effluent water in the United States. Climate change and particularly ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may seriously damage Ceriodaphnia dubia populations, as they seems to be more sensitive than other cladocerans as Daphnia pulex - pulicaria.

Title: H-1C visa
Aspects: {'H visa'}

The H-1C visa was a visa that was previously available to foreign nationals seeking temporary employment in the United States. These visas were made available to foreign nurses coming into the United States to perform services as a registered nurse in areas with a shortage of health professionals as determined by the Department of Labor. The creation of this visa was prompted by a nursing shortage.As of December 20, 2009, this visa classification has been expired. The last H-1C visas were issued in Fiscal Year 2012.

== History ==
On November 12, 1999, the 106th United States Congress passed the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act (P.L. 106-95), which called for the creation of a new H-1C visa for nurses going to work for up to three years in health professional shortage areas. Up to 500 nurses per year can get the visa, but each state is limited to 25 H-1C nurses a year.  The 1999 law is very similar to a 1989 law that created the H-1A visa for nurses. That visa category had expired in 1995 after unsuccessful efforts to extend its life.The key differences between the two programs are:
The number of H-1C visas is capped at 500 per year, significantly less than the annual number of H-1A visas issued when the H-1A was first introduced.
The facility where the nurse will work must be in a health professional shortage area.One of the few immigration measures passed by the 109th United States Congress was the extension of the H-1C category. In November 2006, Congress approved legislation to extend the H-1C program for three more years. This classification expired as of December 20, 2009. The last H-1C visas were issued in Fiscal Year 2012.


== Statistics ==

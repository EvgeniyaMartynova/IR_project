== History ==
This song was inspired by films directed by Nicolas Roeg, including Performance (written & co-directed by Donald Cammell), Walkabout, Don't Look Now, The Man Who Fell to Earth, and Insignificance. Its lyrics refer directly to many of them. For example:

The last four lines of the first verse "Man dies first reel / People ask what's the deal? / This ain't how it's supposed to be / Don't like no Aborigine" are a reference to the 1971 film Walkabout, which begins with an adult character committing suicide, which then leaves two children to survive a trek across the Australian outback, aided by a young Aborigine male.
The 2nd verse (from "Took a trip to Powis Square" to "Insanity Bohemian style") refers to the two main characters in Performance; a retired rock star (played by Mick Jagger) and a gangster on the run (played by James Fox)
"King of brains" - refers to Albert Einstein, a lead character in Insignificance (note also the reference to "relativity" in the chorus)
"Queen of the sack" - refers to Marilyn Monroe, a lead character in Insignificance
"Hall of fame baseball" - refers to Joe DiMaggio, a lead character in Insignificance
"Senator's a hoodlum" - refers to Joe McCarthy, a lead character in Insignificance
"Space guy fell from the sky" refers to The Man Who Fell to Earth starring David Bowie
The 2nd verse (from "Met a dwarf who was no good" to "Gets to take the funeral ride") describes Don't Look Now, starring Donald Sutherland.Included throughout the song are dialogue samples taken directly from the film Performance.

I Just Wasn't Made for These Times is the second studio album by Brian Wilson. Co-produced by Don Was, the album followed Wilson's eponymous debut seven years after its release. It also serves as a soundtrack album for the documentary Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times, also directed by Was. The titles are derived from the Beach Boys' song "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times" (1966).

After his solo debut, Wilson's psychotherapist, Eugene Landy, had significant influence on Wilson's projected follow-up, Sweet Insanity, which was shelved in 1990 and never released. After Landy's court-ordered departure, Wilson returned to the studio and embarked on multiple projects.
Wilson admitted in 1995: “At first, I thought ‘This is gonna be contrived, the songs were all old hat. But then I understood the context of it all, so I felt free to talk without worrying about what I was saying. I got a sense of my self — a sense of worth.

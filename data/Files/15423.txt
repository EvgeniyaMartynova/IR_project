Title: Lenovo System x
Aspects: {'X series'}

System x is a line of x86 servers produced by IBM, and later Lenovo. They were a sub-brand of IBM's System brand, alongside IBM Power Systems, IBM System z and IBM System Storage). In addition, IBM System x was the main component of the IBM System Cluster 1350 solution.
In January 2014, IBM announced the sale of its x86 server business to Lenovo for $2.3 billion, in a sale completed October 1, 2014.


== History ==
Starting out as IBM PC Server, rebranded Netfinity, then eServer xSeries and now System x, these servers are distinguished by being based on off-the-shelf x86 CPUs; IBM positions them as their "low end" or "entry" offering.
Previously IBM servers based on AMD Opteron CPUs did not share the xSeries brand; instead they fell directly under the eServer umbrella.  However, current AMD Opteron-based servers fall under the System x brand.


== IBM PC Server ==


=== PC Server range ===
IBM PC Server 300
IBM PC Server 310 (PCI/ISA)
IBM PC Server 315 (PCI/ISA)
IBM PC Server 320 (PCI/EISA)
IBM PC Server 325 (PCI/EISA)
IBM PC Server 330 (PCI/EISA)
IBM PC Server 500 (MCA)
IBM PC Server 520 (PCI/EISA or PCI/MCA)
IBM PC Server 704 (PCI/EISA)
IBM PC Server 720 (PCI/MCA)


=== Numbering scheme ===
300 range for high-volume, entry level servers
500 range for midrange
700 range for high-end.


== IBM Netfinity ==

Not to be confused with a different IBM product with a similar name, NetFinity (notice the capital F).


=== Netfinity range ===
IBM Netfinity 1000
IBM Netfinity 3000, 3500
IBM Netfinity 4000R, 4500R
IBM Netfinity 5000, 5100, 5500, 5500-M10, 5500-M20, 5600
IBM Netfinity 6000R
IBM Netfinity 7000, 7000-M10, 7100, 7600
IBM Netfinity 8500R


=== Numbering scheme ===
The numbering scheme started off similar to that of the IBM PC Servers, but additional ranges were added, like the entry-level 1000 model later on. Models ending with an R, are rack-mount.


=== KVM Cabling scheme ===
Some Netfinity servers used IBM's C2T cabling scheme for Keyboard/Video/Mouse.


== IBM eServer ==


=== IBM eServer range ===
IBM eServer was a marketing effort to put all of the diverse IBM server platforms under one header. The AS/400 became the IBM eServer iSeries, the RS/6000 became the IBM eServer pSeries, the S/390 mainframe became the IBM eServer zSeries and the Intel processor based IBM Netfinity servers became the IBM eServer xSeries.
A few exceptions were however made

IBM eServer 325, 326, 326m
IBM eServer BladeCenter, BladeCenter T, BladeCenter H, BladeCenter HT


==== Numbering scheme ====
For marketing reasons the AMD processor based e325, e326 and e326m and the BladeCenter which supports non-Intel processor products were not branded xSeries, but were instead placed directly under the eServer brand. The xSeries brand was limited to only Intel-based server products.
From a numbering perspective the AMD servers did fit into the xSeries range, under the similar x335 and x336 Intel processor products. These numbers were not re-used in the xSeries range to prevent confusion.


=== IBM eServer xSeries ===


==== xSeries range ====
IBM eServer xSeries 100, 130, 135, 150
IBM eServer xSeries 200, 205, 206, 206m, 220, 225, 226, 230, 232, 235, 236, 240, 250, 255, 260
IBM eServer xSeries 300, 305, 306, 306m, 330, 335, 336, 340, 342, 345, 346, 350, 360, 365, 366, 370, 380, 382
IBM eServer xSeries 440, 445, 450, 455, 460


==== Numbering scheme ====
100 series are entry-level tower servers
200 series are tower servers
300 series are rack-mount servers
400 series are rack-mount scalable servers


==== KVM Cabling scheme ====
Many xSeries servers used IBM's C2T cabling scheme for Keyboard/Video/Mouse.

Lenovo FlexSystemLenovo also had its own ThinkServer family of Intel servers. This family is technically less advanced than System x. At the time of this writing, System x is being discontinued and replaced by the Lenovo ThinkSystem family of Intel servers.


=== Enterprise eX5 architecture ===


=== Enterprise X4 architecture ===


=== Numbering scheme ===
2nd digit increments to show capability
3rd digit is a 0 for tower models, and 5 for rack-mount
4th digit is a 0 for Intel processors, and 5 for AMD Opteron.
Models with a T at the end are meant for Telco purposes.


== iDataPlex ==

System x iDataPlex, introduced in 2008, was used by many TOP500 supercomputers, including SuperMUC and Stampede. Other smaller installations included SciNet Consortium's General Purpose ClusterIt is an unusual form-factor in that you have two columns of 19" rack servers side-by-side in a single rack. This rack, unlike traditional racks, however was very shallow which is where the space saving came from for large installations. As such it only supports specially designed shallow servers. It was typically deployed in combination with a Rear Door Heat Exchanger (RDHx) to cool the exhaust heat with water.
It was replaced with IBM NeXtScale in 2014.

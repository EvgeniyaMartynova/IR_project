== Critical reception ==
The song received a favorable review from Taste of Country, which called it "personal, like almost every song on the Hard 2 Love album, but also powerful and experimental like Brice’s early recordings." The reviewer added that "it’s the thump of a deep drum — perhaps a tympani — and loud cry of the pedal steel that provide the song’s signature and any emotional reaction that comes while listening." Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song four stars out of five, writing that "the production and melody behind the lyrics is mid-tempo and right in the core pocket of what Lee Brice does best." Bjorke called it "a strong single choice and a song that should be the beginnings of a successful upcoming album."

== Music video ==

There were two different music videos for the single albeit had the same setting (set outside a church with a Cadillac parked in front of it). The original hip-house version features Fixxit, Coolen and the dancers along with additional female dancers. When it later released internationally as a single it was redone with Hollywood as the featured rapper in place of Fixxit. Even the scene where the Cadillac's owner pushed aside the rappers was altered; Fixxit riding off in a bike, Hollywood in a car in need of gasoline. The video's song and message also featured the image and quotes of Nelson Mandela flashing in the song break.

Title: List of Metrobus routes (Washington, D.C.)
Aspects: {'X9', 'X8'}

This is a list of bus routes operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), branded as Metrobus.  Many are the descendants of streetcar lines operated by the Capital Transit Company or its predecessors.


== Numbering ==
Most Metrobus routes follow the rules below:
Metrobus routes in Washington, D.C., have either a two digit number (31, 42, 64, etc.) or a letter followed by a number (A2, S2, X8, etc.).
Metrobus routes in Montgomery County, MD, have a letter followed by a number (C4, Q4, Z6, etc.).
Metrobus routes in Prince George's County, MD, have a letter followed by two numbers (F12, J12, P12, etc.).
Metrobus routes in Northern Virginia have one or two numbers followed by a letter (1A, 16C, 29N, etc.).Odd-numbered routes are typically part-time variants of even-numbered routes. At one time, odd numbered routes were express routes, but that distinction has been abandoned. Most Maryland and Washington, D.C., routes are grouped by their first digit. When this system was laid out in 1936, the following clustering was used:


== Divisions ==


== Current routes ==


=== District of Columbia lines ===


=== Maryland Lines ===


=== Virginia lines ===


=== School routes ===
These routes connect schools to Washington Metro stations or other local points. They are primarily intended for students, but are open to anyone, and stop at all stops along their routes.

Additional trips are added to the following routes during school hours: 38B, 62, 90, 97, A2, A7, B2, F6, H3, H4, K2, M4, P6, R2, T18, U6, W1, W4, X2, X3, Z2


== Former routes ==

These routes have been served by Metrobus at one point but have since been discontinued due to either low ridership, duplication of another route, simplification to other routes, combined into another route, low funding, or transferred to another bus company like Fairfax Connector, Alexandria DASH, Arlington Transit (ART), DC Circulator, Ride On, or TheBus. However some routes would be reincarnated into new routes for Metrobus. Examples of reincarnations are the 7M, 16C, 26A, 34, C8, Q1, V7, V8, and Z7.

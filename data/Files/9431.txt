== Composition ==
The opening verse of the song is a recurring factor in Morrison's music and lyrics, the belief that the predominant sense of enjoyment and appreciation of life is to be found in the present moment:

Biographer John Collis writes that this final song pulls together all the concerns of the album:

In one moment ('there is no past ... there's only now') Morrison combines earthly love with that inspired by a sun-warmed landscape, the yearning for simplicity with the love of 'the (one) Magician who turned water into wine.

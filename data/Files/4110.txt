Title: Fresh Aire
Aspects: {'FA1'}

Fresh Aire is the first album by new-age musical group Mannheim Steamroller. It was originally released in 1975.


== Background ==
The record was followed by seven additional albums in the Fresh Aire series. Each of the first four Fresh Aire albums is based on a season; Fresh Aire's theme is Spring. (There is some evidence that this theme may have been imposed upon the album after the fact, as the rest of the series progressed, since the liner notes for this album clearly link each of the 12 tracks to the 12 months of the year.)
Besides the eponymous seventh tune, several of the track names are played on musical terms denoting the form of that song. The title track "Fresh Aire" is an air, "Saras Band" is a sarabande, and perhaps most cleverly, "Pass the Keg (Lia)" is a passacaglia.
Composer Chip Davis refers to his music as "18th century rock and roll."

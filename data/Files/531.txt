== Music video ==
The song's only music video was that of a live performance dubbed over by the recorded version of the song, and was directed by Jennifer Lebeau. This may have played a part in its lesser success as a single. The recording took place at Wembley Arena.


== Reception ==
The song is fairly popular among many Offspring fans, often called the best on Conspiracy of One despite its release as a third single. Aside from being a stronger song, this also may be because it is less deliberately mainstream than the previous two singles and also has a more serious subject matter. However, it is rarely played live and remains one of their less well-known singles.

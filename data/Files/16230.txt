The music video for "The Yabba" was released on September 9, 2015 and features the band members playing in various settings. Tom Breihan of Stereogum described the video, saying, "It opens with an image of an unnaturally still woman, in ’70s costume, spinning a basketball on her finger. But the clip mostly focuses on the three members of the band, hard at work, bashing out the song in an outdoor desertscape or surrounded by their own light screens. Sometimes, they’re surrounded by a group of creepily expressionless onlookers." The video was directed by Roger Guàrdia.

Title: Waddell's Station
Aspects: {'Waddell'}

Waddell's Station was a stage stand on the old Butterfield Overland Mail route in Indian Territory. It was located in what is now Atoka County, Oklahoma. It is sometimes confused with Roger's Station, a post-Civil War stage stand and post office, which was three miles (5 km) in an easterly direction from Waddell's.
Waddell's Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places (#72001054) in 1972.

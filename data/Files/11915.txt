Title: Radial Road 10
Aspects: {'R10'}

Radial Road 10, more commonly referred to as R-10, is a planned network of roads and bridges that altogether would form the tenth radial road of Manila in the Philippines. It is the westernmost of the radial roads north of the Pasig River running north-south close to the shoreline of Manila Bay. When completed, the road would link the City of Manila with Navotas, and the northern coastal provinces of Bulacan, Pampanga and Bataan in Central Luzon.
At present, only the Port Area–Navotas segment of the road is complete.


== Route ==
The road consists of the following segments:


=== Mel Lopez Boulevard ===

Between Anda Circle in Port Area and the Estero de Marala Bridge over the Marala Creek (Sunog Apog Creek), R-10 is known as Mel Lopez Boulevard, formerly President Ferdinand E. Marcos Highway or Marcos Road. It is the only segment of R-10 in the City of Manila which passes through the Manila North Harbor complex in Tondo before arriving in the city of Navotas where it continues as simply R-10 Road. 


=== Radial Road 10 ===
North of the Estero de Marala, R-10 serves the Navotas Fish Port Complex and connects Tondo with Circumferential Road 4 (C-4) past the Bangkulasi Bridge which leads to South Caloocan and Quezon City in the northeast.


=== Manila–Bataan Coastal Road ===
A highway linking Manila and the province of Bataan has been proposed as an extension of R-10. Similar to Radial Road 1 and its segments, Roxas Boulevard and the Manila–Cavite Expressway, the highway would run along the coast of the Manila Bay north of the Pasig River. From the current terminus of R-10 in Navotas, the road would travel north along the coastal Bulacan municipalities of Obando, Bulakan, Malolos, Paombong and Hagonoy, and northwest along the Pampanga coast of Macabebe, Masantol, Sasmuan and Lubao, and terminating in Hermosa and Dinalupihan in Bataan. The proposed highway would be built over fishponds and would also serve as flood barriers for the coastal provinces.

Aspects: {'M. edule'}

Memecylon edule is a small evergreen tree native to India, especially the Deccan Plateau, including most of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Tamil Nadu, Thailand and Borneo. Common names include kaayam, delek bangas, delek air, miat, and nemaaru .
The tree grows on rocky soils and blooms once or twice per year. The fruit is about a centimeter long and green, turning red then black as it ripens. The tree has a thin bark, so it is sometimes also called nipis kulit or "thin-skinned" in Malay. This tree is valued as an ornamental and a source of wood for construction.
The leaves are thick and leathery. They contain glucosides, resins, colouring pigments, gums, starches, and malic acid. They are rich in aluminum. Yellow color dye can be extracted. Leaves and roots are used as a medicine for dysentery and as an astringent.

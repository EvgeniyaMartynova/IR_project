Title: I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg (song)
Aspects: {'I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg'}

"I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg" (German: Ich hab' mein Herz in Heidelberg verloren) is a German song composed in 1925 by Fred Raymond with lyrics by Fritz LÃ¶hner-Beda and Ernst Neubach. The song was an immediate popular hit, and in 1927 Raymond included it in a musical of the same name. Two films, released in 1926 and in 1952, take their titles from the song. It remains the theme song of Heidelberg. It was recorded in Britain by the duo Bob and Alf Pearson.
The English-language lyrics used in The Student's Romance (1935) are by Harry S. Pepper.

Title: Schubert Thematic Catalogue
Aspects: {'D.'}

Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of all his Works in Chronological Order, also known as the Deutsch catalogue, is a numbered list of all compositions by Franz Schubert compiled by Otto Erich Deutsch. Since its first publication in 1951, Deutsch (abbreviated as D or D.) numbers are used for the unique identification of Schubert's compositions.


== 1951 edition ==
The Deutsch catalogue was first published in London in 1951, as Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of all his Works in Chronological Order, compiled by O. E. Deutsch, in collaboration with Donald R. Wakeling.


== 1978 edition: NSE VIII/4 ==
In 1978, as part VIII Supplement / Volume 4 of the New Schubert Edition (NSE), an updated version of the catalogue was published in German.A few compositions that had been undated in the first edition received a new number (usually followed by a letter), e.g. D 993 was renumbered to D 2E.


== Later versions ==
The original 1951 edition (in English) was re-issued several times, for instance in the United States by W. W. Norton. The 1978 version, published by Bärenreiter, had a double objective: it was not only a list of Schubert's works as such, it was also the compendium of all scores published by that publisher in the New Schubert Edition.


=== New versions in English ===
In 1995 Dover Publications republished the 1951 edition, with updates derived from scholarship that had been published since 1951.


=== New versions in German ===
From 1983 compact versions of the catalogue appeared, edited by Werner Aderhold and others.Changes to the numbering of Schubert's works were minor in these later editions.

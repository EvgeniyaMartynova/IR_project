Title: KLRZ
Aspects: {'Z100'}

KLRZ is an all-sports radio station. Licensed to Larose, Louisiana, KLRZ targets both New Orleans and the Tri-Parishes area at 100.3 MHz with an ERP of 89 kW at 584 feet (178 m).
The station, which signed on the air in 1992, is now owned by Coastal Broadcasting Of Larose. In July 2005, Citadel Broadcasting entered into a $6,000,000 agreement to buy the station. However, after Hurricane Katrina, they had backed out of the purchase. In fact, a new tower had been built to put a better signal into New Orleans, and was turned on the week before Katrina hit. Speculation was that Citadel was going to either sign on a Rockin' Country format onto this signal (which eventually was put on 106.7) or move the format of 106.7 the End to 100.3.
In January 1, 2014, the station has dropped the cajun music and became the ESPN Radio affiliate in the New Orleans Market. The station was named the new flagship station of the NBA New Orleans Pelicans on June 26, 2019. 


== History ==
In the early to mid 90s, this station's moniker was Z-100, and was playing a Top 40/Rhythmic Hybrid Format aimed at the New Orleans market at the time. The format was then changed to a Classic Rock format with a mid morning talk show in the mid 1990s before changing to its current format.

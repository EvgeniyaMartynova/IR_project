The station was launched on April 15, 1982, as CKIK-FM, and first broadcast an adult album rock format. Throughout the 1980s and much of the 1990s, CKIK-FM (known on-air as 107 KIK FM and later as Rock 107) played a variety of rock formats.  Early in its history, the station encountered financial difficulties, which were alleviated in 1985, when Harvey Glatt, Ottawa music impresario and founder of CHEZ-FM, acquired a 75% interest in the station, which he held until 1995.In September 1997, CKIK-FM adopted a CHR format branded as "Power 107".
In January 2002, CKIK-FM evolved to a hot adult contemporary station known as "The Peak 107.3".
On February 19, 2004, at 1:07 p.m., CKIK-FM dropped the hot AC format, becoming a classic rock station branded as "Q107".  The station's call letters were changed to CFGQ.In 2007, Terry DiMonte, formerly associated with CHOM-FM in Montreal, joined Q107 as its morning show host.  In December 2011, Terry DiMonte left CFGQ, returning to CHOM in Montreal.
In January 2015, CFGQ-FM changed its slogan from "Calgary's Only Classic Rock" to "Great Hits & Real Classic Rock" but kept the same format.

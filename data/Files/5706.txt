Title: Love or Something Like It
Aspects: {'I Could Be So Good for You'}

Love or Something Like It is the fifth studio album by country music superstar Kenny Rogers, released in 1978. It was Rogers' fourth #1 hit album.


== Overview ==
The album's title cut ("Love or Something Like It") also topped the charts. Though this was the only single to be issued from the album, another cut, "Momma's Waiting" (written by Rogers), was issued on the B-side of a 1978 major hit single, "The Gambler". "Momma's Waiting" was originally recorded by Rogers and The First Edition in 1970.
The song "We Could Have Been The Closest of Friends" was also recorded by a number of other artists including B J Thomas, Sammy Davis Jr. and Tom Jones.
Biographer Chris Bolton notes in the sleevenotes of the 2009 reissue on the Edsel record label that "I Could Be So Good For You", was Kenny's attempt to "go Disco" and suggests the Disco influence may be the reason only one single was pulled from this album. Bolton goes on to call "Momma's Waiting" a close cousin of Merle Haggard's "Mama Tried" and states the album features songs that are a lot more pop slanted -on the whole- than any of Rogers' previous albums, but the album's best tracks still have an over-riding country sound.

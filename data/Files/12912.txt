Title: List of Sony Ericsson products
Aspects: {'T series'}

The following is a list of products manufactured under the Sony Ericsson brand. Most of the models have been released under multiple names, depending on region of release, currently usually indicated by a letter added to the end of the model number ('i' for international, 'a' for North America, and 'c' for mainland China), but indicated on some (mostly older) models by a slightly differing model number. Typically, there is one version for the European and US market, and another for the Asian market. However, some models have yet more versions.
Most "Walkman" branded models are also released as a non-Walkman version; such as the Sony Ericsson w580 and the s500. These versions usually differ only slightly.


== International phones ==
Phones in boldface indicates that the phone is a smartphone.
S = Status, where P indicates under production, D is discontinued and U indicates upcoming .


=== C Series: Cyber-shot ===


==== C902 ====
The Sony Ericsson C902 was released during the second quarter of 2008. It is a java based feature device running on Sony Ericsson's proprietary A200 platform. A special feature was the presence of 8 touch sensitive keys using capacitive technology for the camera mode. The camera technology includes face detection and the music player is similar to the system used on the company's "Walkman" series handsets. The phone is the first in Sony Ericsson's new 'Cyber-shot' C-series of phones, designed to be a successor to the popular K800i and the K850. The C902 is featured in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace, and has been praised for its user interface design and its build quality. Although the device received favourable reviews, analysts did not expect it to reach the same level of popularity or sales as its predecessor, the K800i, because it was not intended to be a "flagship model."


=== F Series: Fun phones ===


=== G Series: Generation Web phones ===


==== G700 ====
The Sony Ericsson G700 was announced at the Mobile World Congress (formerly 3GSM congress) February 2008 and is based on the Symbian OS 9.1 UIQ 3.0 platform. The handset has had below average reviews, with a lot of reviewers criticizing the phone for being priced too high as the better equipped G900 is in the same price bracket while others have lamented the fact that Sony Ericsson chose to implement the same technology that had been presented in late 2006 in the P1. A "business edition" also exists for the Sony Ericsson G700, which has no camera.


==== G900 ====
Announced at the 2008 Mobile World Congress (formerly 3GSM congress) in February of that year, G900 is a mid-to-high-end smartphone based on the Symbian 9.1 UIQ 3.0 platform. The phone sports high quality sound, 3G, Wi-Fi, and a clear 5.0-megapixel camera.


=== J Series: Junior phones ===


=== K Series: Camera phones ===
Some phones have Cyber-shot branding.


=== M Series: Messaging phones ===


=== P Series: PDA phones ===


=== R Series: Radio phones ===


=== S Series: Style / Slider / Swivel phones ===


=== T Series: Tela phones ===


=== V Series: Vodafone phones ===


=== W Series: Walkman phones ===

NOTE: Sony Ericsson may release cell phones in three variants, indicated with a letter after the model number. Example: W200 was released as W200a (for the Americas), W200c (for China) and W200i (rest of the world). The default release letter for most models is "i" which means international.


=== X Series: Xperia phones ===


=== Z Series: Clamshell phones ===


=== Entertainment Unlimited Series: Entertainment phones ===
The first Entertainment Unlimited Phones were announced and launched in 2009, creating a new category where the benefits of Audio and Images were "combined in smart, good-looking and high-performing devices."  Apart from first-rate Audio-Visual strength, what these products have in common are differentiating factors in the User Interface, borrowing from the wider Sony Group UI-developments. Aino is the first product that connects into the world of the Sony PlayStation remotely via remote media play.  Vivaz is the first Sony Ericsson phone supporting High Definition (HD) video capture.

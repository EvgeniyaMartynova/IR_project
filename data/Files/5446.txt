Title: Music on The Shield
Aspects: {'I Am King (disambiguation)'}

Music plays an important role on the FX television drama The Shield.
Stylistically, the music ranged from hip hop (Master P) to  mainstream pop (Duran Duran) to rock (Kid Rock) to country music (Johnny Cash), often within a single episode.


== Opening and end credits ==
The opening credits for each episode displays each starring cast member's name on a black screen interspersed with scenes from the episode. Usually at a poignant moment, an excerpt of the show's theme is played, leading into the show's logo and the listing of series creator Shawn Ryan.  The theme is played in full during the closing credits. The tune is "Just Another Day", by Vivian Ann Romero, Ernesto J. Bautista & Rodney Alejandro.


== Music throughout the episodes ==
Most episodes use a unique piece of music during the opening or closing montage sequence. Often the song signals the characters' emotional mood or the episode's themes.  The show's characters visibly listen to music. The show makes little other use of background music.

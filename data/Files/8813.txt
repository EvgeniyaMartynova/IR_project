Title: Morris & Essex Lines
Aspects: {'M&E'}

The Morris & Essex Lines are a group of former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad railroad lines in New Jersey now owned and operated by New Jersey Transit.  The lines are so called as much of the right-of-way was constructed by the Morris and Essex Railroad. The line was electrified by the DL&W at 3000 V DC in 1930/31, and by August 1984 had been converted to 25 kV 60 Hz by NJ Transit.The lines include service offered on the Morristown Line and the Gladstone Branch, and the former Montclair Branch before 2002. Service is available directly to Hoboken Terminal or via the Kearny Connection (opened June 10, 1996) to Secaucus Junction and Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan. The Morristown Line runs from Hoboken Terminal to Hackettstown, or from New York Penn Station to Dover. The Gladstone Branch runs from Hoboken Terminal to Gladstone. Passengers can transfer at Newark Broad Street or Summit to reach the other destination if necessary.

Title: R22 (New York City Subway car)
Aspects: {'R22'}

The R22 was a New York City Subway car built by the St. Louis Car Company from 1957 to 1958. The cars were a "follow-up" or supplemental stock for the A Division's R21s and closely resembled them.


== Description ==
The R22s were numbered 7300-7749. They were the last single cars built prior to the R33 World's Fair cars built in 1963-1964.
The fleet had two-paned storm door windows that could be opened by dropping down the upper window, though cars 7515-7524 had single drop sash windows instead. Those cars also had Plextone-painted interiors and pink-molded fiberglass seats. 
There were two versions of the R22: Westinghouse Electric-powered cars (7300-7524) and General Electric-powered cars (7525-7749).
The R22s were the first cars to have sealed beam headlights.


== History ==
The R22s first entered service on April 13, 1957, starting to replace most of the IRT "high voltage" type cars. The R22s ran in service for most of their service lives on the IRT Broadway â€“ Seventh Avenue Line painted in green livery.
Cars 7513, 7509, 7516, 7654, 7675 (the interior of which Bernhard Goetz's vigilante action occurred in), and 7686 were used as an automatic test train which ran revenue service on the 42nd Street Shuttle starting in January 1962. The experiment ended on April 21, 1964, when a fire partially destroyed the Grand Central Shuttle platform as well as car 7740. Cars 7509, 7513, and 7516 were not in use at the time; thus they were not damaged in the fire, but the cars never returned to revenue service. In 1973, car 7509 was converted to the 64-foot (19.51 m) test car XC375, which operated on various IRT lines until April 1982, and scrapped on July 12, 1996.


=== Retirement ===

Though a very dependable fleet, the R22s, being single units, were not rebuilt, but replaced in the mid-1980s by the R62s and R62As. The last train made its final trip on December 30, 1987, on the 5 service with a solid consist of R21s.The majority of the fleet was scrapped, but some R22s have been set aside for preservation over the years, including:

7371 - converted to a work car, and later donated to the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine. It is fully operational, though modified with trolley poles, and makes occasional runs around the museum, often coupled to R33 World's Fair car 9327. The car lost its original number plates and now bears number plates from other retired R22 subway cars (7370, 7373, 7435, and 7460).
7422 - converted to R95 revenue collection car 1R714. The car was retired in 2006 and is now preserved by the New York Transit Museum.A handful of R22 cars are currently in work service:

7346, 7376, 7413, 7432, 7571, and 7629, converted to R71 hose reach cars and overhauled under the R159 program.
7397, 7441, 7608, and 7633, converted to R71 de-icer cars and overhauled under the R159 program.7486 is currently at the 207th Street Yard. The car was stripped and was to be reefed, but is now awaiting scrapping.16 R22s were converted to R71 rider cars after retirement, but were replaced with R161s (R33s converted into rider cars) in the mid-2000s and eventually reefed.Cars 7340, 7446, 7505, 7657, 7659, and 7691 were converted to R123 continuous welded rail holder cars for set DCR and overhauled under the R128 program.


== In popular culture ==
A train of R22s were featured in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, a 1974 film about the hijacking of a subway car, seen in the film as number 7339, on a downtown 6 train.

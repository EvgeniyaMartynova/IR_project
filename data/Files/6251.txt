Aspects: {'J series'}

The Fujifilm FinePix J series of digital cameras consists of the later models of the company's entry-level point and shoot digital cameras. The J series is a partial replacement range for the A-series range.
The first J-series model released was the 8.2-megapixel J10, which was released in early 2008. As of February 2009, there are eight different models in the J-series range, from the J10 up to and including the J150W. All models in the range are powered by lithium ion rechargeable batteries.  
All J-series cameras have the standard CCD sensors. The first few models, the J10, J12 and the J50 use the xD-Picture Card flash memory format, whilst the later models use SD/SDHC flash memory format, these include the J100, J110W, J120 and the J150W. The J15fd uses both flash memory formats.

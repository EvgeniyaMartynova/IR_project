Title: Jensen S-type
Aspects: {'S-Type'}

The Jensen S-type was a car built by Jensen Motors from 1936 until 1941 as both a saloon and a convertible. It was the firm's first volume production car, based on Ford motors from the United States, and chassis parts from Ford of Britain sourced through M B K Motors. The car was built on a steel chassis and used aluminium for the body panels. The car was sold with either a 2,227 cc (2.2 L; 135.9 cu in) or a 3,622 cc (3.6 L; 221.0 cu in) Ford flathead V8 engine, equipped with two downdraft carburetors, Vertex ignition, and a Columbia overdrive rear axle. The cars were available in three body styles: 2-door convertible, 3-door tourer, and 4-door saloon.
In total, there were about 50 S-type cars built by Jensen in their West Bromwich factory, with an estimated 10 cars still surviving today.

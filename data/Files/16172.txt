Title: Ya Ya
Aspects: {'Ya-ya'}

"Ya Ya" is a song by Lee Dorsey. The song was written by Dorsey, Clarence Lewis, Morgan Robinson, and Morris Levy.  Levy's participation in the writing has been called into question. In fact, the Flashback release of the single (image) lists only Dorsey and Lewis as writers, as do the liner notes to the American Graffiti soundtrack.The track includes session guitar player Jimmy Spruill on it.
The song was inspired by a children's nursery rhyme.

The song reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the R&B singles chart in 1961.


== John Lennon version ==
According to author Mark Lewisohn in The Complete Beatles Chronicles" (p. 365), the Beatles performed "Ya Ya" regularly live from 1961 to 1962 (in Hamburg and Liverpool and elsewhere). The lead vocal was always by John Lennon. No recorded version is known to survive. However immediately after the Beatles left Polydor Records their close associates Tony Sheridan and Roy Young cut a version of it for that studio. Much later (1974) John Lennon cut a version for his Rock 'n' Roll album.

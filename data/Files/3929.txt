Title: Nikon F75
Aspects: {'F75'}

The Nikon F75 (sold in the United States as the N75 and Japan as the U2) was the last consumer-level autofocus 35mm SLR camera sold by the Nikon Corporation beginning in February 2003. The camera replaced the similarly consumer-targeted Nikon F65.
The Nikon F75 is still sold cheaply on the used market, and is valued because it can drive Nikon's newest lens designs, including those with AF-S and VR.
There was a version, dubbed the F75D (N75D) that featured a date-recording back.

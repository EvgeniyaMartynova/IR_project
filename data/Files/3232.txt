Aspects: {'E3A'}

Minamikyushu Expressway (南九州自動車道, Minami-Kyūshū jidōshadō) is one of the Expressways of Japan from Yatsushiro to  Kagoshima linking with the Kyushu Expressway.  It runs through the southern half of Kumamoto prefecture, and the northern half of the Kagoshima prefecture. The total length is 140 km.  


== Overview ==
The first section of the expressway was opened to traffic in 1988. As of March 2007 the expressway incomplete in many areas. The next sections are scheduled to open in 2009 (Tanoura Interchange to Ashikita Interchange). After this, Most of the incomplete areas will be built according to the New Direct Control System, whereby the burden for construction costs will be shared by the national and local governments and no tolls will be collected. Currently the section between Hinagu Interchange and Tsunagi Interchange, Noda Interchange and Akune Interchange, and Satsumasendai-Mizuhiki Interchange and Ichiki Interchange operates according to this principle.
The route parallels the Kagoshima Main Line of Kyushu Railway Company and National Route 3 for much of its length.

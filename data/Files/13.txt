Title: A Bao A Qu (song)
Aspects: {'A Bao A Qu (disambiguation)'}

"a bao a qu" is a single by Japanese experimental doom band Boris. It was released as a 7-inch picture disc by SuperFi Records and is limited to 524 copies. This song is an extended take on the version included on Soundtrack from Film "Mabuta no Ura" and is completely different from the version that appears on The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked. The first side is the intro to the song, drawn out to nearly five minutes and completely instrumental. Side B is extremely similar to the Mabuta no Ura version, with full rock instrumentation and vocals.
There is also a music video for "a bao a qu" based on this extended version rather than those on Mabuta no Ura or The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked, though the two halves are crossfaded together.
An alternate take of the song appears on Boris / Variations + Live in Japan, based on the live arrangement. Live recordings appear on Live in Japan and Archive II.
The song's title may refer to the fictional creature √Å Bao A Qu or the space station A Baoa Qu from the anime Mobile Suit Gundam.

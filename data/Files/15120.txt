== Economy ==
The main source of income within Wabamun are power plants located in the area operated by TransAlta Utilities. The power plant within the village was closed down because of increased pressure from environmental agencies and aging. The Wabamun power plant was the subject of heated debate among the residents and cottagers of Wabamun Lake. Due to the lack of a coolâ€“off pond, the water used to cool the internal systems was deposited back into the lake, which enhanced the weed population dramatically. As of March 31, 2010, the plant was taken off the grid and demolished.

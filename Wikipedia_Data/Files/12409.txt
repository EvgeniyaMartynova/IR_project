Title: Sternbergia candida
Aspects: {'S. candida'}

Sternbergia candida is a bulbous flowering plant in the family Amaryllidaceae, subfamily Amaryllidoideae, which is used as an ornamental. It has white flowers which appear in spring.


== Description ==
Sternbergia candida is a rare plant which occurs only in south-west Turkey, where it grows at around 1100 m, on the edges of cedar woods. It was only discovered a few years before being named in 1979 (by Brian Mathew and Turhan Baytop). The slightly twisted grey-green leaves appear in late winter to early spring and are about 1 cm wide. White flowers follow the leaves, normally in January to February in their native habitat, on stems up to 20 cm. The flowers may be scented.


== Cultivation ==
Sternbergia candida is not reliably hardy in countries subject to frost and is then recommended for culture under the protection of at least a cold greenhouse or frame. It is propagated by bulb division.

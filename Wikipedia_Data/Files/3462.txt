Title: British F-class submarine
Aspects: {'F-class submarine'}

The F class submarine was built for the Royal Navy as a coastal submarine based on the doubled hulled V class submarine (World War I) with very few minor improvements. The only important improvement was the addition of a stern torpedo tube. The F class were ordered as a successor to the E class submarine, but only three were built out of the ten ordered.
During World War I, the F class submarine was primarily used for coastal defence.
Only three of the class were built, the first F1 being built at Chatham. All three of the class survived the war and ended their service as training boats at Campbeltown. F1 and F3 were scrapped in 1920, F2 was sold in 1922.

Title: Sparkle (soundtrack)
Aspects: {'I Get High (disambiguation)'}

Music from the Warner Bros. Picture "Sparkle" is a soundtrack album by American singer Aretha Franklin, written and produced by Curtis Mayfield. Released on May 27, 1976, the disc is the soundtrack album for the 1976 Warner Bros. motion picture Sparkle, starring Irene Cara. The songs on the soundtrack feature the instrumental tracks and backing vocals from the film versions, with Franklin's voice taking the place of the original lead vocalists.
This album returned Aretha to gold status after two low-selling albums. The first single release, "Something He Can Feel", was a #1 R&B hit for her and reached #28 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, it was Aretha's only Pop Top 40 hit during the second half of the 1970s. The album itself reached the Top 20 of Billboard's main album chart and was certified Gold for US sales of over 500,000 copies. In 2009, it was reissued on Rhino Records' budget Flashback Records label. The songs "Something He Can Feel" and "Hooked on Your Love" were covered by En Vogue on their 1992 multi-platinum hit album Funky Divas.

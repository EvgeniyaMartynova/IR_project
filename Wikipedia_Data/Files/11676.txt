Title: Rangea
Aspects: {'R. grandis'}

Rangea is a frond-like Ediacaran fossil with six-fold radial symmetry. It is the type genus of the rangeomorphs.
A total of six species have been described, but only the type species Rangea schneiderhoehoni is considered valid:

R. brevior Gürich 1933 = R. schneiderhoehoni.
R. arborea Glaessner et Wade, 1966 = Charniodiscus arboreus.
R. grandis Glaessner et Wade, 1966 = Glassnerina grandis = Charnia massoni.
R. longa Glaessner et Wade, 1966 = Charniodiscus longus.
R. sibirica Sokolov, 1972 = Charnia sibirica = Charnia massoni.Rangea schneiderhoehoni fossils have been found in the Kanies and Kliphoek Members of the Dabis Formation and in the Niederhagen Member of the Nudaus Formation, Namibia. These deposits date from around 548 Mya. Rangea fossils have also been reported from the Ediacaran deposits of the Arkhangelsk region, Russia and in Australia. These fossils date from around 558-555 Mya.Rangea seems to have led a sessile existence upon the seabed.

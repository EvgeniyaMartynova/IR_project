Title: D3 motorway (Slovakia)
Aspects: {'D3 motorway'}

The Motorway D3 (formerly D18), sometimes called the Kysuce Motorway, is a motorway in northern Slovakia. Initially, it is supposed to be only a two lane motorway in the Čadca - Slovak/Polish border section, and four lane motorway in the remaining section Hričovské Podhradie - Čadca.
It lies on these E-roads: E50, E75 and E442.
It starts at the motorway junction with the D1, bypassing Žilina, then goes to the north around Kysucké Nové Mesto and Čadca, having an interchange with the R5, and ends near the village of Skalité, where it crosses the Polish border and connects to Expressway S1.

Number 1 Angel is the third mixtape by English singer and songwriter Charli XCX, released on 10 March 2017 by Asylum Records.

== Background ==
In January 2017, Charli XCX stated in an interview with Rolling Stone that she was planning to release a mixtape before the release of her third album saying: "I just got bored and made a load of songs, so I decided to put them out." In another interview, with 93.3, she told the radio station that she recorded the mixtape in two weeks. She described it by saying, "this is more like crying into the champagne than drinking it", and compared it to her work with Sophie. The mixtape was slated for a February 2017 release but was pushed back due to label conflicts. Charli XCX initially recorded the mixtape without her label's permission, stating that the situation, along with the album delay, had her feeling "frustrated and annoyed".


== Critical reception ==
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Number 1 Angel received an average score of 73, based on 5 reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews. Frank Falisi from Tiny Mix Tapes gave the mixtape four out of five stars, comparing it to Madonna's early works and calling it "a text for mitigating engagements." At Pretty Much Amazing, Mick Jacobs stated that "Aitchison intelligently pairs her clever lyrics against beats that push genres outward, her filling in the spaces with her hooks and gigantic personality," whilst Katherine St. Asaph of Pitchfork wrote that the mixtape "is largely stolen by its guests, like Uffie and CupcakKe."

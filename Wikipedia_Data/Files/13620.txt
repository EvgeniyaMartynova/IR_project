== History ==
The school was dedicated on April 21, 1868, as Whitewater Normal School and graduated its first class of teachers in June, 1870. Albert Salisbury, writing in 1893, remarked: "The young men and women who gathered into this school in those early years found here a new and stimulating atmosphere. The spirit of earnestness–almost a severe earnestness,–pervaded the place; and the high ideals of its administration were contagious in a remarkable degree." Salisbury wrote of a unique tradition of the school known as "Students' Day." One day during the term faculty would, unannounced, be entirely absent from the school. Once students recognized that the day must be "Students' Day", they would elect a President and Faculty from amongst themselves who would take up the regular duties of the day. The annual catalogue stated the purpose of "Students' Day" as the following: "The object of thus putting the institution under the care of the students is to test their moral culture, their executive ability, and their devotion to their work."In 1927, the school received authority to grant baccalaureate degrees in education and the name was changed to Whitewater Teachers College. With the addition of liberal arts programs in 1951 it became Wisconsin State College–Whitewater, and was later designated a Wisconsin State University in 1964. In 1971, after the merger of the former University of Wisconsin and the former Wisconsin State Universities, the school became part of the University of Wisconsin System and has had the name of University of Wisconsin–Whitewater since then.The university briefly gained national attention in 2018 when Chancellor Beverly Kopper's husband was investigated for allegedly sexually harassing university employees. The chancellor resigned during the investigation amidst allegations that she had ignored the alleged harassment.On May 23, 2019, the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents unanimously approved the appointment of Dr. Dwight C. Watson as the 17th Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, following the recommendation made by a selection committee. Dr. Watson, who previously served as Provost and Vice President of Academic and Student Affairs at Southwest Minnesota State University, started on August 1, 2019.


== Campus ==

The University of Wisconsin–Whitewater encompasses 400 acres in southeastern Wisconsin. The iconic landmark of the university's campus, Old Main, was destroyed by fire on February 7, 1970. The school's oldest building, it was the only one that had been part of the original campus. The east wing of Old Main, now called Hyer Hall, is all that remains of the building. It houses many of the university's administrative offices, in addition to classrooms and lecture halls. After the fire that destroyed Old Main the building's carillon bell was removed and installed in front of the Alumni Center. Now an electronic carillon bell rings regularly throughout the day.The James R. Conner University Center occupies the heart of campus. The "UC" contains a bowling alley, an art gallery, a stage for live music, a coffee shop, and several dining options.

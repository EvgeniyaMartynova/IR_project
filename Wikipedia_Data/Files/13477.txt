Title: Scion xB
Aspects: {'T2B'}

The Scion xB is a compact car (subcompact car in its first generation) made by Toyota for the United States market and sold under their youth-oriented Scion brand. It is a box-shaped, 5-door hatchback.


== First generation (XP30; 2003–2006) ==

The first-generation xB was a lightly modified and rebadged version of the Japanese-market subcompact Toyota bB. It was a small hatchback based on the Toyota Echo/Yaris platform. The xB was one of two models in the lineup of Toyota's US-exclusive Scion division present at the brand's 2003 launch, the other being the xA, based on the Toyota ist.


=== First-generation xB vs. first-generation bB ===
Only the first-generation models for both the xB and bB are related. Second-generation models are based upon different platforms.
To create the first-generation xB, the bB was modified from right- to left-hand drive, the front passenger area was also changed significantly with the bB's front bench seat replaced with bucket seats and the column-mounted shifter changed to a floor-mounted shifter.
The available drivetrains also differed. The bB was available with either the 1.3 L I4 2NZ-FE engine or the 1.5 L 1NZ-FE, mated exclusively to a 4-speed automatic transmission with available all wheel drive. The xB was only available with the 1NZ-FE that produced 108 hp (81 kW) and 105 lb⋅ft (142 N⋅m) in US spec, but offered both a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. All-wheel drive was not offered on the xB.
The Toyota bB was equipped with a compact spare tire under the floor of the luggage area. On the Scion xB, a compact spare tire was stored under the left side of a raised rear cargo floor.  Since the spare tire raised the cargo floor by several inches, a storage bin was added to the right of the spare tire to reclaim some of the lost storage space. A jack was stored under the driver's seat of the xB.
The Toyota bB had a pull-out storage tray under the passenger seat that the xB lacks.
The bB went on sale in February 2000, whereas the xB went on sale in June 2003 for the 2004 model year. Sales of the first-generation bB ended in December 2005, whereas the first-generation xB ended sales in June 2007.


=== Scion t2B (2005) ===
Scion t2B (Tall-Two Box) is a concept hatchback designed by Calty Design Research and built by Five Axis Models in Huntington Beach, California, with interior design by Calty senior designer Bill Chergosky and Naoki Hamajima. The 5-door hatchback included a 2.4-liter I4 engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, 14-inch brakes with slotted rotors, 20-inch billet aluminium wheels, LED fog lamp, remotely operated power rear hatch, asymmetrical tri-level instrument panel features a large information ticker, MP3 docking station, dual moonroof, half-length suicide doors.
The vehicle was unveiled at the 2005 New York Auto Show.


=== Release series vehicles ===

The xB, like the xA and tC, was also available in a "Release Series" for each of its model years. These came with limited-edition paint colors, matching seat colors, and special modifications such as DVD players, custom tail lights, special wheels or wheel covers, and other accessories, to make the RS different from the others. All Scion RS' receive special badges indicating the serial number. Limited Edition vehicles were, from a marketing standpoint, used to create a buzz for the brand name, with their exterior colors tending toward loud or bright hues (i.e. orange, yellow, red, blue, green).  Preordering is available at each dealership on a first-come, first-served basis. Scion's "Pure Price" program requires dealerships to sell the vehicle at the advertised price. Resale values of Release Series vehicles command a premium because of their packaged options and scarcity.

== Second generation (E150; 2007–2015) ==

The second-generation Scion xB is styled as a 5-door hatchback of the t2B concept unveiled at the 2006 New York Auto Show.  Toyota unveiled the production xB at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show. The new xB was less boxy in shape and larger than its predecessor.  The 2008 model year xB is 2.8-inch (71 mm) wider, 12-inch (300 mm) longer - including 4-inch (100 mm) longer wheel to wheel - and over 600 pounds (270 kg) heavier than the first-generation xB.
The first-generation Scion xB was very similar to its original bB inspiration, but the second-generation xB was based on American buyers' "wants" relative to the first-generation, combined with the new styling of the 2005 bB. The sales of the Scion xB plummeted after the switch from the compact first-generation to the much larger second-generation xB2.

The Scion xB was produced by Kanto Auto Works, Ltd. based in Japan.  Due to the 2011 Japanese earthquake, production was suspended from 14 March 2011 to 18 April 2011, affecting several Toyota vehicles, including the Scion xB and Scion xD.  Plants affected by the disaster included the Toyota Motor Hokkaido Plant, the Toyota Motor Tohoku Plant, and the Central Motor Corporation Miyagi Plant, which produces the Toyota Yaris.The second-generation xB is equipped with a 2.4 L straight-4 Toyota 2AZ-FE engine rated at 158 hp (118 kW) and 162 lb⋅ft (220 N⋅m), shared with the first-generation tC and the Toyota Camry, which at 22 mpg‑US (11 L/100 km; 26 mpg‑imp) city / 28 mpg‑US (8.4 L/100 km; 34 mpg‑imp) hwy has a higher fuel consumption than the previous model's 1.5 L engine (26 mpg‑US (9.0 L/100 km; 31 mpg‑imp) city / 31 mpg‑US (7.6 L/100 km; 37 mpg‑imp) hwy). A five-speed manual and a sequential-shift four-speed automatic are the only factory options aside from the color and stereo.
A choice of three new head units is available on all 2008 Scions. All sound systems feature six speakers and standard iPod connectivity. The base head unit has MP3, WMA, and AAC CD compatibility and Scion's SSP equalizer presets. The base unit can also be set to any of three Scion model presets (xB, xD, or tC) and includes an "Automatic Sound Levelizer" feature that automatically increases the volume as the vehicle speed and ambient noise increases. The Premium head unit features a small LCD that can display pictures and movies downloaded from Pioneer's website in addition to the features on the base unit. A navigation system is also available. The SNS 100 system can play DVD movies in addition to GPS functionality and the features of the base system, aside from the backlit color choices.
In 2011, for the 2012 model year, a new radio with bluetooth became standard.
All xBs come standard with four-wheel anti-lock brakes, brake assist, electronic brakeforce distribution, Vehicle Stability Control driver and front passenger dual stage airbags, front seat-mounted side torso airbags, front and rear side curtain airbags, and a first-aid kit.In 2013, the xB was chosen by cars.com as a Top 10 Best Base Model.

The second-generation Scion xB has won the Top Safety Pick award by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) for six years in a row. It received an overall "Good" score in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety frontal offset crash test, and another "Good" overall score in the side impact crash test, with all nine measured categories also rated "Good".

The equivalent Australian-market Toyota Rukus was discontinued in October 2015 and the Japanese-market Toyota Corolla Rumion was discontinued in December 2015.


== Electric vehicles ==
AC Propulsion has produced an electric version of the first-generation xB called the eBox.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute have converted a Scion xB into a commuter electric vehicle as part of their ChargeCar research project.


== Scion marketing ==
The Scion xB's marketing is aimed at Generation Y, Americans born between 1980 and 1994.  This group of car buyers is extremely important to manufacturers due to their large numbers (78 million) and their differing perceptions and demands of the vehicles they drive. Despite the Scion xB's target market, the average age of an xB buyer is 46.Although Toyota expected the xA to sell better than the xB, the reverse proved to be true, with the xB outselling its sibling 2 to 1.


== Sales ==
The Scion xB was Scion's most popular model in the United States until 2011, when it was surpassed by the tC. In the U.S., sales of the xB have been dropping after the introduction of the second generation, from a peak of over 60,000 to 17,017 in 2011.


== Chinese copy ==
In 2009, Great Wall Motor of China released the Coolbear, which is a copy of the first-generation xB, but with a different front end.

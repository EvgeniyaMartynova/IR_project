Title: I Don't Care (Shakespears Sister song)
Aspects: {"I Don't Care"}

"I Don't Care" is a song by British-based female duo Shakespears Sister, released in May 1992 as the third single from their second studio album Hormonally Yours. The song reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart and had similar success internationally, reaching the top 20 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. It also charted on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 55. Like several of Shakespears Sister's previous singles, it was heavily remixed for its release as a single, including re-recorded vocals, added instrumentals, and a new jazz track.
The song incorporates a segment of the poem "Hornpipe" by Dame Edith Sitwell (from her Façade, and Other Poems poetry book), which is a surreal poem that attempts to capture the flow of a sailors jig. The poem is spoken by Siobhan Fahey on the song.


== Music video ==
The music video, directed by Sophie Muller, showed Siobhan Fahey and Marcella Detroit's characters plotting to kill one another. The video ends with a climax on a mock stage - Fahey dressed in Victorian garb, in contrast to Detroit's poised and refrained character. During the first two choruses the band is performing the song, first in rehearsal and the second chorus their in concert.   
The video mirrored the internal struggle the duo was going through, as their personal relationship was deteriorating and eventually the duo was ended by Fahey in 1993. The video is also notable for its forefront inclusion of the duo's touring members.

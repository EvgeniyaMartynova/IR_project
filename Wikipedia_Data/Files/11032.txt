Title: Aero Cóndor
Aspects: {'Q6'}

Aero Cóndor, also known as Aero Condor Peru, is an airline based in Lima, the capital of Peru. It was founded and started operations in 1975, and provides domestic charter flights, cargo, scenic, and air ambulance services. Its main hub is Jorge Chávez International Airport in Lima.


== History ==
Aero Cóndor operated an extensive domestic network of more than fifteen destinations until June 2008, when most scheduled services were suspended due to the high fuel prices. On the same month, the Peruvian Ministry of Transportation and Communications ordered the grounding of Aero Cóndor fleet of Boeing 737 airliners due to safety concerns as these aircraft had been recently involved in several incidents. Nowadays, the company only serves scenic and charter flight.


== Operations ==
The company is only active at the domain of scenic tourist flights and charter flights.

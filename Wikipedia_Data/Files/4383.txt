Title: Whitespotted garden eel
Aspects: {'G. maculata'}

The whitespotted garden eel (Gorgasia maculata), also known as the Indian spaghetti eel, is an eel in the family Congridae (conger/garden eels). It was described by Wolfgang Klausewitz and Iren√§us Eibl-Eibesfeldt in 1959. It is a marine, tropical eel which is known from the Indo-Western Pacific, including Maldives, the Solomon Islands, the Philippines, the Cocos Islands, Comoros, India, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. It dwells at a depth range of 25 to 48 metres (82 to 157 ft), and lives in non-migratory colonies that form burrows on sandy slopes, usually near coral reefs. Males can reach a maximum total length of 70 centimetres (28 in).Due to its wide range and lack of known major threats, the IUCN redlist currently lists the whitespotted garden eel as Least Concern.

Title: JEL classification codes
Aspects: {'G29'}

Articles in economics journals are usually classified according to the JEL classification codes, a system originated by the Journal of Economic Literature.  The JEL is published quarterly by the American Economic Association (AEA) and contains survey articles and information on recently published books and dissertations. The AEA maintains EconLit, a searchable data base of citations for articles, books, reviews, dissertations, and working papers classified by JEL codes for the years from 1969. A recent addition to EconLit is indexing of economics-journal articles from 1886 to 1968 parallel to the print series Index of Economic Articles.


== Structure ==
There are 20 primary JEL categories
:JEL Subcategories[α]
Each JEL primary category has secondary and tertiary subcategories, for example, under JEL: D – Microeconomics:

JEL: D1 – Household Behavior and Family Economics
JEL: D11 – Consumer Economics: TheoryJEL code (sub)categories, including periodic updates, are referenced at Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) Classification System.  Links to definitions of (sub)categories are at JEL Classification Codes Guide with corresponding examples of article titles linked to publication information, such as abstracts.


== Purpose ==
Articles in economics journals also list JEL codes (for example JEL: B12), facilitating their use across search engines. Comprehensive uses of JEL (sub)classifications include:

• The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2008, v. 8, Appendix IV, pp. 854–69, and for the online version by drilling to the primary, secondary, or tertiary JEL code of interest  here and pressing the Search button below it for article-preview links .
• National Bureau of Economic Research Working Papers abstracts by year via links
• Research Papers in Economics via links.

== Notes ==
^α  JEL codes A through Z denote primary categories (e.g. D Microeconomics). Secondary categories are specified by an additional Arabic numeral (e.g. D3 Distribution), tertiary categories by a following second Arabic numeral (e.g. D30 General). Articles in economics publications use JEL codes in this manner: JEL: B12.
^β  Developed in the context of the Journal of Economic Literature, the JEL classification system became a standard method of classifying economics literature, including journal articles, books, collective volume articles, dissertations, working papers in economics, book reviews from the Journal of Economic Literature, and EconLit.

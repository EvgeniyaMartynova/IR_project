== History ==
In 1861, a parish municipality was formed and named L'Ange-Gardien. In 1869, a post office serving the parish and village was established. In 1881, it was separated from Buckingham Canton and formed into a parish municipality. In 1915 the village of Angers was separated from L'Ange-Gardien.
On January 1, 1975 L'Ange-Gardien, Buckingham, Masson, Notre-Dame-de-la-Salette, Angers, Buckingham-South-East, and Buckingham-South-West were merged to form the City of Buckingham, but because of adverse public reaction, the merger did not last long. On January 1, 1980, the former municipalities of West Buckingham, Buckingham Township, and L'Ange-Gardien Parish were reorganized into the Municipality of L'Ange-Gardien.

Title: J-invariant
Aspects: {'J-function'}

In mathematics, Felix Klein's j-invariant or j function, regarded as a function of a complex variable τ, is a modular function of weight zero for SL(2, Z) defined on the upper half-plane of complex numbers. It is the unique such function which is holomorphic away from a simple pole at the cusp such that

          (
          
            e
            
              2
              π
              i
              
                /
              
              3
            
          
          )
        
        =
        0
        ,
        
        j
        (
        i
        )
        =
        1728
        =
        
          12

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle j\left(e^{2\pi i/3}\right)=0,\quad j(i)=1728=12^{3}.}
  Rational functions of j are modular, and in fact give all modular functions. Classically, the j-invariant was studied as a parameterization of elliptic curves over C, but it also has surprising connections to the symmetries of the Monster group (this connection is referred to as monstrous moonshine).

       (the modular discriminant)This can be motivated by viewing each τ as representing an isomorphism class of elliptic curves. Every elliptic curve E over C is a complex torus, and thus can be identified with a rank 2 lattice; that is, a two-dimensional lattice of C. This lattice can be rotated and scaled (operations that preserve the isomorphism class), so that it is generated by 1 and τ ∈ H. This lattice corresponds to the elliptic curve

Note that j is defined everywhere in H as the modular discriminant is non-zero. This is due to the corresponding cubic polynomial having distinct roots.


== The fundamental region ==

It can be shown that Δ is a modular form of weight twelve, and g2 one of weight four, so that its third power is also of weight twelve. Thus their quotient, and therefore j, is a modular function of weight zero, in particular a holomorphic function H → C invariant under the action of SL(2, Z). Quotienting out by its centre { ±I } yields the modular group, which we may identify with the projective special linear group PSL(2, Z).
By a suitable choice of transformation belonging to this group,

  The function j(τ) when restricted to this region still takes on every value in the complex numbers C exactly once.  In other words, for every c in C, there is a unique τ in the fundamental region such that c = j(τ). Thus, j has the property of mapping the fundamental region to the entire complex plane.
Additionally two values τ,τ' ∈H  produce the same elliptic curve iff τ = T(τ') for some T ∈ PSL(2, Z). This means j provides a bijection from the set of elliptic curves over C to the complex plane.As a Riemann surface, the fundamental region has genus 0, and every (level one) modular function is a rational function in j; and, conversely, every rational function in j is a modular function. In other words, the field of modular functions is C(j).


== Class field theory and j ==
The j-invariant has many remarkable properties:

If τ is any CM point, that is, any element of an imaginary quadratic field with positive imaginary part (so that j is defined), then j(τ) is an algebraic integer. These special values are called singular moduli.
The field extension Q[j(τ), τ]/Q(τ) is abelian, that is, it has an abelian Galois group.
Let Λ be the lattice in C generated by {1, τ}. It is easy to see that all of the elements of Q(τ) which fix Λ under multiplication form a ring with units, called an order. The other lattices with generators {1, τ′}, associated in like manner to the same order define the algebraic conjugates j(τ′) of j(τ) over Q(τ). Ordered by inclusion, the unique maximal order in Q(τ) is the ring of algebraic integers of Q(τ), and values of τ having it as its associated order lead to unramified extensions of Q(τ).These classical results are the starting point for the theory of complex multiplication.


== Transcendence properties ==
In 1937 Theodor Schneider proved the aforementioned result that if τ is a quadratic irrational number in the upper half plane then j(τ) is an algebraic integer.  In addition he proved that if τ is an algebraic number but not imaginary quadratic then j(τ) is transcendental.
The j function has numerous other transcendental properties.  Kurt Mahler conjectured a particular transcendence result that is often referred to as Mahler's conjecture, though it was proved as a corollary of results by Yu. V. Nesterenko and Patrice Phillipon in the 1990s.  Mahler's conjecture was that if τ was in the upper half plane then e2πiτ and j(τ) were never both simultaneously algebraic. Stronger results are now known, for example if e2πiτ is algebraic then the following three numbers are algebraically independent, and thus at least two of them transcendental:

  
    
      
        j
        (
        τ
        )
        ,
        
          
            
              
                j

              τ
              )

                  ′
                
              
              (
              τ
              )

  Note that j has a simple pole at the cusp, so its q-expansion  has no terms below q−1.
All the Fourier coefficients are integers, which results in several almost integers, notably Ramanujan's constant:

=== Moonshine ===
More remarkably, the Fourier coefficients for the positive exponents of q are the dimensions of the graded part of an infinite-dimensional graded algebra representation of the monster group  called the moonshine module – specifically, the coefficient of qn is the dimension of grade-n part of the moonshine module, the first example being the Griess algebra, which has dimension 196,884, corresponding to the term 196884q. This startling observation, first made by John McKay, was the starting point for moonshine theory.
The study of the Moonshine conjecture led John Horton Conway and Simon P. Norton to look at the genus-zero modular functions. If they are normalized to have the form

  
    
      
        
          q
          
            −
            1

          O
        
        (
        q
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle q^{-1}+{O}(q)}
  then John G. Thompson showed that there are only a finite number of such functions (of some finite level), and Chris J. Cummins later showed that there are exactly 6486 of them, 616 of which have integral coefficients.

  be a plane elliptic curve over any field. Then we may perform successive transformations to get the above equation into the standard form y2 = 4x3 − g2x − g3 (note that this transformation can only be made when the characteristic of the field is not equal to 2 or 3). The resulting coefficients are:

== Inverse function ==
The inverse function of the j-invariant can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function 2F1 (see also the article Picard–Fuchs equation). Explicitly, given a number N, to solve the equation j(τ) = N for τ can be done in at least four ways.

  One root gives τ, and the other gives −1/τ, but since j(τ) = j(−1/τ), it makes no difference which α is chosen. The latter three methods can be found in Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions to alternative bases.
The inversion applied in high-precision calculations of elliptic function periods even as their ratios become unbounded. A related result is the expressibility via quadratic radicals of the values of j at the points of the imaginary axis whose magnitudes are powers of 2 (thus permitting compass and straightedge constructions). The latter result is hardly evident since the modular equation of level 2 is cubic.

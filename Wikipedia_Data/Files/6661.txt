A black bloc, organized by Students for a Democratic Society, and advertised as a "radical youth bloc" on the DC Indymedia site, met at Dupont Circle to begin a feeder march to the main rally site on the National Mall.  The march from Dupont Circle to the Mall roughly followed the course of Massachusetts Avenue NW to its intersection with 7th Street NW near the Washington Convention Center.  The march then followed 7th Street through Chinatown and the Penn Quarter neighborhood before reaching the Mall. The feeder march continued past the back of the mainstream rally on 7th Street, and onto Maryland Avenue SW, before briefly stopping at 3rd Street, at roughly the center line of the Mall.

Capitol police stopped the SDS feeder march near the corner of 3rd and Maryland. As the march turned north, police blocked protesters who walked onto the Capitol lawn. Other protesters, both from the march and on the Mall, moved up in support. The Capitol police moved back to the Capitol building.  Some participants in this group left graffiti on the Capitol grounds.

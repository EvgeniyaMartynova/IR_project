Title: Mycobacterium flavescens
Aspects: {'M. flavescens'}

Mycobacterium flavescens is a species of the phylum Actinobacteria (Gram-positive bacteria with high guanine and cytosine content, one of the dominant phyla of all bacteria), belonging to the genus Mycobacterium.
Etymology: Latin, flavescens = becoming golden yellow.


== Description ==
Gram-positive, nonmotile and acid-fast rods.
Colony characteristics

Rough, yellow-orange scotochromogenic, butyrous colonies.Physiology

Slow growth on Löwenstein-Jensen medium at 25-37 °C, but not at 45 °C within 7–10 days.
Although growth rate is intermediate, metabolic and physiologic properties are more like rapidly growing species.Differential characteristics

Serologic specificity demonstrated by immunodiffusion.
Related to Mycobacterium fortuitum: can be distinguished by its intense pigment production, and its slow rate of growth.


== Pathogenesis ==
Not associated with disease.  Biosafety level 2.


== Type strain ==
Normal human flora, environmental habitat.
First isolated from a drug treated tuberculous guinea pig (Mexico).Strain ATCC 14474 = CCUG 29041 = CIP 104533 = DSM 43991 = JCM 12274 = NCTC 10271 = NRRL B-4038.

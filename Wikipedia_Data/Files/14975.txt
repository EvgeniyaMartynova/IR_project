The flight school employs multiple flight instructors and boasts a rental fleet of fixed-gear Cessna aircraft, a Piper Arrow, a twin-engine Beechcraft Duchess, a Super Decathlon for aerobatic and tailwheel training, and at least one Cirrus aircraft.  Trident provides primary instruction through ATP, and is an authorized Cirrus training center.

The BlackBerry Z10 is a high-end LTE touchscreen-based smartphone developed by BlackBerry, previously known as RIM.

== Development ==
BlackBerry's chief operating officer Kristian Tear and chief marketing officer Frank Boulben fought against co-founder and former co-CEO Mike Lazaridis to have the touchscreen Z10 prioritized over the Q10 which has a physical keyboard.Boublen was then responsible for and received "criticism for the marketing campaign that supported the Z10 launch, including a confusing Super Bowl advertisement which some board members hated".Both Tear and Boublen were ousted on November 25, 2013 by new CEO John S. Chen, whom weeks earlier had replaced Thorsten Heins.


== Software ==

The BlackBerry Z10 uses the new BlackBerry 10 (Currently running on 10.3.3) mobile operating system based on QNX. The user interface of BB 10 is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interaction with the OS includes a range of multi-touch gestures, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the BB10 operating system and its multi-touch interface. The Z10 comes pre-loaded with a variety of default BlackBerry applications.The phone has a mobile hotspot functionality, which supports up to 8 devices, sharing its internet connection. It accesses the BlackBerry World, an online application distribution platform for the BlackBerry OS. The service allows users to browse and download applications, games, music, videos from the BlackBerry World store. Additionally, the touchscreen keyboard learns the user's writing style and suggests words to help the user type faster.The BlackBerry Z10 has an 8-megapixel camera on the back with autofocus and LED flash capable of shooting 1080p video, while there's a 2-megapixel camera on the front that shoots video at 720p". A unique feature in the Z10's camera app is TimeShift. "BlackBerry has been showing it off for a while, and it lets users dial back the time on certain pictures so that people aren't making less-than-ideal faces in it (like blinking mid-shot).".The Z10 has voice control, that allows the user to operate the phone by spoken commands. This can be used to send messages, compose emails, dictate documents, and search the phone just by speaking to the app.

Title: Farman F.40
Aspects: {'F40'}

The Farman F.40 was a French pusher  biplane reconnaissance aircraft.


== Development ==
Developed from a mix of the Maurice Farman designed MF.11 and the Henry Farman designed HF.22, the F.40 (popularly dubbed the Horace Farman) had an overall smoother crew nacelle. An open tail boom truss supported a horizontal tailplane and a curved fin. The aircraft went into production in 1915.


== Operational history ==
Forty French Air Force escadrilles (squadrons) were equipped with F.40s. They operated for just over a year, but were replaced in early 1917.
The F.40 was also operated by the No. 5 Wing of the Royal Naval Air Service, Belgian forces in France, and also by the Russians
Italian aircraft maker Savoia-Marchetti built F.40s for use by the police force until 1922.

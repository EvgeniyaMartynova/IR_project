Title: Siegel G-function
Aspects: {'G-function'}

In mathematics, the Siegel G-functions are a class of functions in transcendental number theory introduced by C. L. Siegel.  They satisfy a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients, and the coefficients of their power series expansion lie in a fixed algebraic number field and have heights of at most exponential growth.


== Definition ==
A Siegel G-function is a function given by an infinite power series

  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
        
          z
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }a_{n}z^{n}}
  where the coefficients an all belong to the same algebraic number field, K, and with the following two properties.

f is the solution to a linear differential equation with coefficients that are polynomials in z;
the projective height of the first n coefficients is O(cn) for some fixed constant c > 0.The second condition means the coefficients of f grow no faster than a geometric series. Indeed, the functions can be considered as generalisations of geometric series, whence the name G-function, just as E-functions are generalisations of the exponential function.

Title: Huawei P series
Aspects: {'P series'}

The Huawei P series (formerly the Huawei Ascend P series) is a line of high-end Android smartphones produced by Huawei. The P series was formerly marketed as part of Huawei's larger Ascend brand, but this has since been dropped.
Under the company's current hardware release cadence, P series phones are typically directed towards mainstream consumers as the company's flagship smartphones, refining and expanding upon technologies introduced in Mate series devices (which are typically positioned towards early adopters). The P series has featured a strong emphasis on camera functionality; since 2016, and beginning with the Huawei P9, Huawei has been in a co-engineering partnership with the German manufacturer Leica.

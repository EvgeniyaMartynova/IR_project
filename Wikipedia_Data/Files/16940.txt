== History ==


=== 1990s ===
99.7 was issued its first callsign, WUAE, on April 23, 1992. The station would remain a construction permit until June 1995, when it would sign on as modern rock WDGE-"99.7 The Edge." The station was built by local broadcast engineer Randy Place. Starting with the acquisition of former smooth jazz WOTB in 1996 (which became WDGF on June 14, 1996), The Edge advertised itself as "99.7/100.3 The Edge."  This simulcast would last a short time as the 100.3 frequency became "100.3 The Beat". Meanwhile, WDGE began leaning towards hard rock and became WXEX, calling itself "99.7X", in November 1997.  This format lasted until New Year's Day 1999, when it returned to simulcasting 100.3 as "100FM The Hawk."


=== 2000s ===

The 2000s started with 99.7 still simulcasting 100.3 as "The Hawk."  Both stations flipped formats again, this time to all-1980s "Z100" (still as a simulcast). In 2002, 99.7 turned off its stereo pilot and became sportstalk "99.7 The Score", or most times when simulcasting WSKO/790, "99.7 and 790 The Score". 99.7 carried the Patriots Rock Radio Network (which it still does as a simulcast of WPRO), Pawsox Radio Network until 2006 (those rights went to WHJJ in 2007) as well as the New York Yankees Radio Network until 2007 (the former AM side of The Score, now WPRV, still carries the Yankees).  "The Score" ended on March 10, 2008 with the AM side becoming WPRVâ€“"True Oldies 790", and 99.7 becoming WEAN-FM and simulcasting AM 630 WPRO.

Title: LNER Class J39
Aspects: {'J39'}

The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) Class J39 was a class of medium powered 0-6-0 steam locomotive designed for mixed traffic work throughout the former LNER system between London and the north of Scotland.


== History ==
The class was introduced by Nigel Gresley in July 1926, based on his previous Class J38 (introduced in January 1926) but with larger driving wheels. The larger wheels enabled them to be used on both passenger and freight trains, although at the expense of a lower tractive effort. As a result they were given the BR power classification 4P/5F, rather than the 6F of the earlier class. A total of 289 examples were built over next fifteen years.
The larger wheels necessitated the provision of low splashers over the front two wheels, which is the main means of differentiating between the two classes. The locomotives were all fitted with superheaters and Ross 'Pop' safety valves.

All passed into British Railways ownership in 1948 and they were numbered 64700-64988. They began to be withdrawn from service in 1959 and all examples had been scrapped by the end of 1962.


== Sub-classes ==

The class was divided into three sub-classes depending on the type of tender fitted.

J39/1 Standard LNER 3500 gallon tender.
J39/2 Standard LNER 4200 gallon tender.
J39/3 Various former North Eastern Railway tenders 3940-4125 gallons.


== Accidents and incidents ==
Circa 1930, locomotive No. 1448 was derailed by trap points at Lumpsey Colliery, Brotton, Yorkshire.
On 28 August 1950, the connecting rod of a locomotive of this class became detached and consequently pierced the firebox, scalding the driver.
On 23 October 1950, locomotive No. 64880 was hauling a passenger train that was derailed at Drumburgh, Cumberland due to the condition of the track. Two people were killed and three were injured.


== Preservation ==
None have survived to preservation but there are plans to build a replica of an LNER J39,(BR 64960) along with a J38, for preservation in a few years to come.

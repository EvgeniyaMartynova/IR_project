== Background ==
In early 2013, it was announced that The X-Files would return to comic book form with the subtitle "Season 10". The series debuted in June 2013. Joe Harris wrote the series and Michael Walsh and Jordie Bellaire provided the interior artwork with Matthew Dow Smith taking over Walsh's art duties with Issue 11. The series continued the series' mythology, with the first arc "seek[ing] to bring the mythology of the Alien Conspiracy back up to date in a more paranoid, post-terror, post-WikiLeaks society." Furthermore, sequels to popular Monster-of-the-Week episodes are expected to be made.Harris first become attached to the project after Chris Ryall of IDW Publishing asked him if he was at all interested in a comic adaptation of the series. Harris, who was an avid fan, was receptive to the idea and "holed up for a couple of days and punched out a take on the material". He then presented his ideas to IDW, who approved of the stories. Harris then had to seek approval from Fox, the owner of the series' rights, and "get them excited about the direction". Harris then met with series' creator Chris Carter, who agreed to be executive producer for the comics. Carter's job would be "providing feedback to the creative team regarding scripts and outlines to keep the new stories in line with existing and on-going canon."Carlos Valenzuela illustrated the regular covers for the first nine issues, while Francesco Francavilla took over this function starting with issue #10.

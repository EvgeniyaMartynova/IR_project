== History ==
The area was inhabited for thousands of years by cultures of indigenous peoples.  French explorers and traders encountered the historical Miami Native Americans beginning in the 17th century.
Wabash County, along with Delaware County, was originally formed Jan. 1820 out of the 1818 New Purchase resulting from the Treaty of St. Mary's. Wabash County was the Wabash River drainage area, and Delaware County, the White River drainage area.  Numerous counties were carved out of the Wabash New Purchase. Wabash County as it exists today was organized out of a remnant portion of the original county in 1835.
The name "Wabash" is an English spelling of the earlier French name for the river, Ouabache.  French traders derived the French version from the Indian name for the river, Wabashike (pronounced "Wah-bah-she-keh") (meaning "pure white".)  Much of the river bottom is white limestone, now obscured by mud.

In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, assessor, prosecutor, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government.

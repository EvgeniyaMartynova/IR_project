Soul of a Man is a 2006 R&B album by Eric Burdon. It is dedicated to Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker and the city of New Orleans. It follows his 2004 comeback album My Secret Life and the 2005 live album & DVD Athens Traffic Live.
It reached No. 43 on the German and No. 165 on the French album chart.

The song "Feeling Blue" was written by Eric Bibb. "Slow Moving Train" is a song he first performed in early 2005. It's dedicated to U.S. President John F. Kennedy. In 2008 he wanted to shoot a video of it, which never was done yet. Burdon also covered two songs by the folk-singer-songwriter David Munyon; "GTO" features a bass solo and a spoken intro and "Never Give Up Blues" shows him in melancholy.

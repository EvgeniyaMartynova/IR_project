Title: I Belong to You (Love Unlimited song)
Aspects: {'I Belong to You'}

"I Belong To You" is a 1974 single by the trio Love Unlimited, which was their only single to hit #1 on the R&B chart (for one week, in early 1975). It was their second and last Top 40 entry, peaking at #27. The ballad was done in a retro girl group singing style and was written and produced by Barry White. Mariah Carey's "It's a Wrap" samples the song on her 2009 Island Def Jam album Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel.

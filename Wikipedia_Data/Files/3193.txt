== History ==
Editor & Publisher traces its beginnings back to 1884, when The Journalist, its weekly predecessor, was founded.  Editor & Publisher was born 17 years later and merged with The Journalist in 1907.  E&P later acquired Newspaperdom, a trade journal for the newspaper industry that started in 1892. In 1927, E&P merged with another trade paper, The Fourth Estate. E&P was edited by Robert U. Brown from 1953 to 1999.E&P was purchased in 1999 by VNU Business Media, later renamed the Nielsen Company, which also published Billboard, Adweek, Mediaweek, The Hollywood Reporter  and many other business-to-business magazines.A 2001 survey of 350 newspapers in six states indicated that copy editors and their supervisors were more likely to read E&P than any other magazine in the journalistic trade press, with 80.6% of copy editors and 90.6% of supervisors reporting that they read it either regularly or occasionally.In December 2009, unable to find a buyer, owner Nielsen Co. decided to shutter the 125-year-old publication in January 2010. On January 14, 2010, however, the Duncan McIntosh Company (Irvine, California), publisher of Boating World, Sea Magazine and The Log newspaper, announced its purchase of Editor & Publisher. Greg Mitchell was replaced by Mark Fitzgerald, the journal's editor-at-large, and staffer Joe Strupp was also eliminated.
In October 2010, Mark Fitzgerald, Shawn Moynihan and Jim Rosenberg were laid off and replaced with employees from elsewhere in Duncan McIntosh Co.In August 2019, Duncan Macintosh Company sold the publication to a Delaware based Limited Liability Corporation(LLC) named The Curated Experiences Group, who appointed Mike Blinder, a veteran newspaper consultant, as the new Publisher of the magazine. Nu Yang, E&P's Managing Editor under the Duncan Macintosh Company was elevated to the role of Editor in Chief by Blinder in September of 2019.

However, she manages to escape by feigning unconsciousness on the day of the wedding.
Lalita runs into Banke (Shakti Kapoor), who is a theater master and starts working with him. Banke's friend Raj (Rishi Kapoor) needs a girl to act as his fake would-be-wife to soothe his grandfather Rai Saheb (Kader Khan), who insists that he settle down soon. Banke sends Lalita to Raj's house where she tells everyone that her name is Shikha. Over time, Raj and Lalita fall in love.  
Unfortunately, JB is still looking for Lalita. He finds her blind aunt at a nursing home and kills her when she refuses to reveal Lalita's whereabouts.

Title: Battle of Kaba
Aspects: {'Kaba'}

The Battle of Kaba was fought at Kaba, Fiji, in 1855 between self proclaimed Fijian Tui Viti (King) Cakobau and his enemies from Rewa and Bau. Cakobau was supported by a strong fleet from Tonga, sent by Tu'i Tonga (King) Taufa'ahau (George I) of Tonga and Enele Ma'afu, governor of the Tongan population in Fiji. The battle was a major victory for Cakobau, thanks mainly to his Tongan allies, and cemented his leadership over Fiji. It also, however, underlined his dependency on the military power of Tonga, especially since Ma'afu remained in Fiji.

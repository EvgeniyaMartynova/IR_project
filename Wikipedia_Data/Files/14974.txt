Title: Hansa-Brandenburg W.29
Aspects: {'W29'}

The Hansa-Brandenburg W.29 was a German monoplane fighter floatplane which served in the closing months of World War I, from bases on the North Sea coast.
It was based on the W.12 biplane that it was designed to replace. The monoplane configuration created less drag, and thus gave greater speed.

== History ==
The United States Navy reorganized its Naval Air Reserve units in 1970. To bolster their strength two Reserve Carrier Air Wings (CVWR) were formed, CVWR-20 on the U.S. East Coast and CVWR-30 on the U.S. West Coast.
Utilizing assets from reserve squadron VA-2Z1 attack squadron VA-210 was established at the NAS South Weymouth, Massachusetts on 1 July 1970. The unit was commanded by Commander W.M. Hollister and equipped with A-4C Skyhawk attack planes.
However, CVWR-20 had originally only attack squadrons. The decision was made to replace two of the attack squadrons by fighter squadrons in 1971. VA-210 was one of the squadrons to be replaced by fighter squadrons VF-201 and VF-202. Aircraft of VA-201 made their last operational flight on 14 December 1970, the squadron being disestablished on 30 June 1971.

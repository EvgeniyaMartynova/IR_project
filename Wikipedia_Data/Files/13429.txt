Title: Taiyō to Ciscomoon
Aspects: {'T&C'}

Taiyō to Ciscomoon (太陽とシスコムーン), later known as T&C Bomber (T&Cボンバー), was a Japanese girl group under Hello! Project that debuted in April 1999. They released multiple singles and two albums before disbanding in late 2000.


== History ==
The group consisted of four members: Atsuko Inaba (稲葉貴子), born March 13, 1974 in Osaka; Miho Shinoda (信田美帆), born May 18, 1972 in Tokyo; Ruru Honda (本多ルル), born March 18, 1976 in Shenyang, Liaoning, China; and Miwa Kominato (小湊美和), born February 15, 1977 in Fukushima Prefecture. The group was created under the name Taiyō to Ciscomoon ("Sun and Ciscomoon"), but changed their name to T&C Bomber in March 2000. The group disbanded the same year after a final performance in Osaka, on October 9, 2000.
The band reformed in early 2009, after one of the group's former members posted a blog entry suggesting a reformation for a limited time to celebrate the group's ten-year anniversary, and the release of their new greatest hits album. Their first official reunion was on January 9, 2009 in Shibuya. In March of that year, the group called for fans to sign a petition for a 10th anniversary live performance. In 2 months, the petition received more than 2,200 signatures. Their final live performance took place in October; however, Ruru did not take part in the performance due to scheduling conflicts with her live concerts in Japan. Afterwards, the group's official blog was ended, though it was not taken down and was occasionally updated with information about the members (though has since been removed from the Oricon site).
In 2013, Up-Front Works confirmed that they will reform (minis RuRu)for a concert at Hello! Project's New Year's Eve concert.
In 2015, they reunited again for a concert in Japan again, this time with Ruru for the first time since their disbandment.

After the group split up, the only artist to remain signed with Hello! Project was Atsuko Inaba. She continued performing as a dancer, and appeared in the chorus of various songs over the next nine years; however, her contract with UpFront Agency was terminated in late 2009, after both Inaba and the management decided that her career would go no further with Hello! Project—Inaba also stated that she would "like to see the world from a different angle" after being a performer for so long.

Title: Norrland Dragoon Regiment
Aspects: {'K8'}

The Norrland Dragoon Regiment (Swedish: Norrlands dragonregemente), also K 4 or K 8, was a Swedish Army cavalry regiment located in the province of Lappland that traces its origins back to the 17th century. It is still in active service as the Norrland Dragoons detachment of Norrbotten Regiment (I 19), still located in Arvidsjaur. The current name of the fighting unit is the Army Ranger Battalion.
Units from AJB have been involved in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, Pakistan, Ukraine and Chad (continuously in Afghanistan since 2004).


== History ==

The regiment has its origin in the Ångermanland, Medelpad and Jämtland Regiment raised in 1646. From 1689 on, this regiment was named Jämtland Dragoon Regiment, but had only one company of cavalry troops. This company was semi-separate, with the name Jämtland Cavalry Company (Jämtlands kavallerikompani) and had been split off from Bohus-Jämtland Cavalry Squadron in 1670. The company was renamed Jämtlands hästjägarskvadron in 1802 and after receiving another squadron it was organized into a battalion and renamed Jämtlands hästjägarkår in 1834.
The corps gained full status as a separate unit in 1853 and was given the designation K 8 (8th Cavalry Regiment). It was renamed Norrland Dragoon Regiment in 1892 and when merged with parts of the Crown Prince's Hussar Regiment in 1927 it was redesignated K 4 but kept its name before being reorganized to a battalion and renamed Norrland's Dragoons in 1958. Finally the regiment was renamed back to its old name in 1980.

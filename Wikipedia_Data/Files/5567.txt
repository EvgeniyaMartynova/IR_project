Aspects: {'I Can Be'}

"I Can Be" is a song by British singer-songwriter Taio Cruz, released as the fourth single from his debut album Departure, released in May 2008. The song peaked at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. The single's B-side, "Disco Fever", was written and recorded exclusively for the release, and featured in the television adverts for Britannia High, an ITV1 musical series broadcast in July 2008.


== Reception ==
Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars, claiming: "Taio Cruz has slowly been building a reputation as the finest young R&B talent in the UK. His third single, the electro-tinged 'Come On Girl', broke into the top ten, while debut album Departure revealed the Sussex-born singer had plenty of strings to his musical bow. With the sort of cocky bravado usually reserved for US superstars and without a Timbaland cameo in sight, Taio has all the ingredients to become a credible British alternative to the likes of Usher, Nelly and Justin Timberlake. His latest offering, 'I Can Be', is a slick slice of R&B that should continue his ascent nicely. The electro beats and string samples are subtler and more graceful than Timbaland's chunky wallops, which have sadly become the staple for modern urban music, while the ultra-confident and clich√©-packed lyrics, though not to everyone's tastes, are refreshingly unpretentious. With Estelle lending her vocals to the American remix and word-of-mouth spreading about his talents, Cruz looks like he's genuinely destined for stardom."

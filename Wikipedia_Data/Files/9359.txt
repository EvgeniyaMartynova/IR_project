Title: New York TRACON
Aspects: {'N90'}

The New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) is located in Westbury, New York, on Long Island. New York TRACON, also known as N90, is a consolidated TRACON, meaning that a single location provides approach service for several large airports. The primary responsibility of the New York TRACON is the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of arrival, departure, and en-route traffic. N90 is responsible for three major airports, all located within the same New York Class B airspace: John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport. Additionally, N90 is responsible for dozens of smaller but busy fields, including Long Island MacArthur Airport, Teterboro Airport, Tweed New Haven Regional Airport, and Republic Airport. N90 also controls the large number of VFR aircraft that fly through the New York Class B airspace every day.
The New York TRACON is a Level 12 facility and one of seven "Large TRACONs" currently existing throughout the United States. The others include the Atlanta Large TRACON (A80), the Boston Consolidated TRACON (A90), the Potomac Consolidated TRACON (PCT), the Southern California TRACON (SCT), the Dallas/Fort Worth TRACON (D10), and the Northern California TRACON (NCT).Unlike smaller TRACONs which only utilize one radar, the New York TRACON uses many different airport surveillance radar (ASR) sites, including:

Newark  Liberty International Airport (EWR)
Westchester County Airport (HPN)
Islip MacArthur Airport (ISP)
John F. Kennedy International Airport(JFK)
Stewart International Airport (SWF)


== Area breakdown ==
The New York TRACON is divided into 5 areas. Sectors, along with their frequencies and radio sites, are given below.


=== LaGuardia Area ===
The LaGuardia area of the TRACON controls LaGuardia Airport and two of the higher-traffic volume satellites, Danbury Municipal Airport and Westchester County Airport.

EMPYR (1D): 127.3 at EWR, backup at Mount Freedom

Military (UHF): 257.65 at HPN and 263.0 at LGA


=== Kennedy Area ===
The Kennedy area controls John F. Kennedy International Airport and its only major satellite, Republic Airport. This area controls many international flights from Europe because Kennedy is known in the aviation community as the "Gateway to America".

ROBER (2K): 125.7 at JFK, backup at Douglaston
Military (UHF): 269.0 at JFK


=== Islip area ===
The Islip area controls all low altitude flights along Long Island in addition to Long Island MacArthur Airport.

BEADS (3B): 125.975 at HTO, backup at ISP AFSS
BEADS Low (3N): 118.95 at HTO
CCC (Calverton) (3E): 118.0 at ISP, backup at ISP AFSS
ISP (3H): 120.05 at ISP
LOVES (3I): 124.075 at HVN, backup at Douglaston
SEALL (3R): 133.1 at N90
VIKKY (3Z): 128.625 at CCC
Military (UHF): 343.65 at HTO and 343.75 at ISP


=== Newark Area ===
The Newark area of the TRACON covers Newark Liberty International Airport along with the majority of the TRACON's satellite airports including Teterboro Airport, Morristown Municipal Airport, and Caldwell/Essex County Airport.

ARD (Yardley) (4P): 128.55 at EWR, backup at St. Francis
EWR Departure (4N): 119.2 at EWR, backup at St. Francis

ZEEBO (4S): 123.775 at SAX
Military (UHF): 353.75 at EWR


=== Liberty Area ===
The Liberty area's role is for high altitude departure control for all sectors.  The Catskill position has responsibility for numerous satellites to the north of the NY TRACON airspace.  Three of the higher-traffic volume satellites are Stewart International Airport, Orange County Airport, and Dutchess County Airport.

South (58): 124.75 at EWR, backup at Mount Freedom
West (54): 120.85 at EWR, backup at SBJ
Military (UHF): South and West, 353.75 at JFK; Catskill, 363.1 at HUO; North and East, 268.7 at SWF

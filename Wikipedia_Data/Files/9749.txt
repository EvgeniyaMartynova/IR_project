Title: O'Hare, Chicago
Aspects: {"O'Hare"}

O'Hare, located on the far north side of Chicago, is one of the city's 77 semi-official community areas. O'Hare International Airport is located within the boundaries of this community area. This community area is the only one that extends outside Cook County; the western edge (an area comprising the southwest part of the airport) is in DuPage County.
The area is a transportation hub containing O'Hare International Airport as well as major roads such as Interstate 90, its auxiliary Interstate 190, Interstate 294, Illinois Route 72, Illinois Route 171, U.S. Route 12 and U.S. Route 45. This allows the O'Hare neighborhood, combined with the nearby suburb of Rosemont, to work as an edge city.


== History ==
In the Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien, Alexander Robinson was given two square miles of land in what is now the O'Hare community area as a reward for shielding white settlers during Battle of Fort Dearborn. The land was slowly settled over the remainder of the nineteenth century despite the opening of a railroad depot in 1887. During World War II, the Douglas Aircraft Company produced cargo planes in the area. After the war, the facility became a commercial airport that the City of Chicago eventually developed into O'Hare International Airport. In response to the annexation, the University of Chicago revised its map of official community areas to add O'Hare as the 76th area. It is one of only two revisions to occur since the late 1920s.

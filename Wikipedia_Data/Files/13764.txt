== Murals ==
Notable examples of New Deal art were created for the building. Mining and Forestry and Water and Land, two tempera on canvas murals by Thomas Laman,  were commissioned in 1938 by the Treasury Relief Art Project and were on display in the post office until the building was sold to a private party in 2002. The murals were restored and are currently on display in the new McKinleyville, California Federal Courthouse.

Title: Honesdale, Pennsylvania
Aspects: {'N30'}

Honesdale is a borough in and the county seat of Wayne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough's population was 4,480 at the time of the 2010 census.Honesdale is located 32 miles (51 km) northeast of Scranton in a rural area that provides many recreational opportunities, such as boating, fishing, hiking, hunting, skiing, biking, skateboarding, and rafting. Located in a coal mining region, during the nineteenth century it was the starting point of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, which provided for transport of coal to Kingston, New York, and then down the Hudson River to New York City. In the 19th century, the expansion of railroads eventually superseded regular use of the canal.


== History ==

Honesdale was named for Philip Hone, former Mayor of New York and president of Honesdale's Delaware and Hudson (D & H) Canal Company. Honesdale, originally called "Dyberry Forks," was laid out as a village in 1826 when the D & H Canal was created. It was incorporated as a borough on January 28, 1831.The Honesdale Residential Historic District and the D & H Canal are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.


=== Birthplace of American railroading ===

Honesdale is home to the first commercial steam locomotive run on rails in the United States, the Stourbridge Lion. On August 8, 1829, the Stourbridge Lion started in Honesdale, ran three miles to Seelyville, and returned; Honesdale, therefore, is known as the birthplace of the American Railroad.
The Stourbridge Lion, owned by the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company (D&H) was regrettably considered too heavy for further use.  D&H transported anthracite coal from mines near Carbondale to New York City via Honesdale and Kingston, New York.  Coal was moved by a unique gravity-railroad from the mines to Honesdale where it was transferred to barges and transported via a 108-mile canal to Kingston, New York, then shipped by river barges down the Hudson River to New York City.
The Wayne County Historical Society Museum contains a full-scale replica of the Stourbridge Lion; the Society also displays many historical photographs, artifacts and other exhibits.  The museum is on Main Street and was once the D&H Canal Co. office. It is a brick structure.  The Delaware Lackawaxen & Stourbridge Railroad Company operates The Stourbidge Line Rail Excursions departing from the platform at the Wayne County Visitors Center just off Torrey Lane.  Excursions run Presidents Weekend, Easter, and a full schedule from May through October, and special holiday trips in Nov. and December.
Parts of the original Stourbridge Lion are on display at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.

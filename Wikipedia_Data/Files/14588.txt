On 4 February 1953, the squadron was redesignated Fighter Squadron 84 (VF-84), while deployed to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba aboard USS Antietam. In June 1953, the squadron briefly flew the F8F-2 Bearcat in preparation for transition to the F9F-5 Panther in November 1953. The squadron's current "Sidewinder" name and insignia were adopted in April 1954. Flying the Panther, VF-84 was again deployed to the Mediterranean Sea aboard USS Lake Champlain from September 1954 to April 1955.
On 1 July 1955 the squadron began flying the F7U-3M Cutlass, was redesignated Attack Squadron 86 (VA-86), and conducted extensive evaluation of the AIM-7 Sparrow missile. VA-86 was deployed with the F7U only for the shakedown cruise of USS Forrestal, being assigned to Air Task Group 181.
From May 1957 until 1967, the squadron was assigned to Carrier Air Wing Seven, being equipped with various marks of the A4D/A-4 Skyhawk. Between September 1958 and March 1959, VA-86 was deployed aboard USS Randolph, before CVW-7 was reassigned to the recently commissioned USS Independence.

In April 1961 VA-86 operated from USS Independence near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. In November 1962, the squadron was assigned to Carrier Air Wing Three and embarked in USS Lexington during the Cuban Missile Crisis operating off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. VA-86 was flying a mix of A-4Bs and A-4Cs, as the squadron was transitioning to the A-4C. In April–May 1963, VA-86 provided A-4C detachments aboard Atlantic Fleet anti-submarine carriers USS Essex, USS Randolph and USS Wasp. The aircraft were equipped with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles to provide the carriers with anti-air warfare capability.
From August 1963 to March 1964, VA-86 was again deployed with CVW-7 aboard USS Independence to the Mediterranean Sea. Following this deployment, the squadron transitioned to the A-4E. On 1 July 1965, the squadron conducted its first combat missions, flying from Independence against targets in South Vietnam. In 1966-67, VA-86 was back in the Mediterranean Sea aboard Independence.
On 1 June 1967, VA-86 became the Navy's first operational Atlantic Fleet squadron to fly the A-7A Corsair II. VA-86 was reassigned to Carrier Air Wing Six and made another deployment to Vietnam aboard USS America. The squadron conducted its third South East Asia combat deployment aboard USS Coral Sea from September 1969 to July 1970 while being assigned to Carrier Air Wing Fifteen. In October 1970, VA-86 transitioned to the E model of the A-7.

From 1971 to 1987, VA-86 was again assigned to CVW-8. In late spring of 1972, VA-86 was forced to transition to the A-7C due to unexpected problems with the A-7E's TF-41 engines. The squadron then deployed from June 1972 to March 1973 aboard USS America for a ten-month combat cruise, participating in several intense and lengthy bombing campaigns, including Operation Linebacker and Linebacker II in late-1972. The squadron remained on station until the Paris Peace Accords were signed in late January 1973. This was the squadron’s fourth combat deployment to Southeast Asia, more than any other East Coast attack squadron and resulted in the receipt of the Meritorious Unit Commendation.
The squadron transitioned to the A-7E in 1974 and was aboard USS America for 7 months duty. In 1975, the squadron went aboard USS Nimitz for the ship's maiden voyage and made further deployments during the late 1970s and 1980s. In 1979, VA-86 planes appeared in the movie The Final Countdown, which was filmed aboard USS Nimitz at Naval Air Station Key West, Florida.

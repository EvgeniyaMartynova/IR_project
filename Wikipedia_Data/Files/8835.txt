== Gaming career ==
Mew2King began competing in tournaments in 2005 at the age of 16. Kashan "Chillindude" Khan described M2K as having little natural aptitude for the game, becoming good solely through practicing a lot. During 2006, Mew2King went from being relatively unknown to being one of the best players in the game. In 2004, he spent over 2,000 hours with help from SuperDoodleMan collecting data about various attacks and movements in Melee. In 2007, he managed to place 9th at EVO World 2007. Zimmerman was considered the best Melee and Brawl player from 2008–2009. From 2010–2014, his tournament placing declined and he began losing to improving newer players. Zimmerman and Wyatt "ADHD" Beekman, were banned by Major League Gaming from competing in MLG Dallas 2010, after the two had allegedly conspired to manipulate brackets at Brawl event at MLG DC 2010. The ban came after ADHD had stated that he paid Mew2King US$300 to lose the loser's bracket final, a violation of MLG rules. MLG dropped Brawl from their pro circuit at the end of 2010.For most of 2013, M2K had not won a major tournament all year until he went on a winning streak where he won virtually all of his fights, including against Mango, whom he had not beaten for several years. In 2014, Mew2King lost to aMSa in winners quarters and Armada in losers finals at Kings of Cali 4. Mew2King finished 2nd to Mango at Big House 4 in Romulus, Michigan. After a complex leveling game, Juan "Hungrybox" Debiedma defeated Zimmerman at Paragon Orlando 2015.From 2007 to 2014 Mew2King was member of Empire Arcadia (EMP), a company that has also sponsored e-sports players such as Justin Wong. He left the organization after having issues with back payment from the organization. Zimmerman alleges that since 2009 EMP president Isaiah "Triforce" Johnson has owed him "US$5k total more/less" and has lent Johnson more than US$1,000. From 2011 to 2014 Mew2King was sponsored by CLASH Tournaments (CT). From 2012 to 2014 Mew2King was signed with Vancouver-based Play-For-Keeps, an online e-sports betting service. Mew2King has supported Pastime Gaming and Most Valuable Gaming since late 2014, and started working as a business manager for the latter. By late 2014 to early 2015, Mew2King began focusing his time on Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and online streaming and plans on playing fewer online tournaments due to hand problems. His tournament placings have also declined, placing tied for 9th at Apex 2015. In April 2015 he became a member of esports team COGnitive Gaming. Around June 2015, Mew2king suffered a hand injury and missed CEO 2015 and EVO 2015. He did however attend Super Smash Con in August 2015 where he placed 2nd after losing to Leffen. On August 31 he defeated Leffen in the grand finals of PAX Prime 2015, thereby ending the streak of Swedish players winning national tournaments.
At Paragon Los Angeles 2015, Mew2King placed second, losing to Mango in Grand Finals.Mew2King finished 9-12th in Melee singles at GENESIS 3 in January. In early April Mew2King left COGnitive. On April 17, 2016 Mew2King joined Echo Fox.Mew2King finished in 1st place in Melee singles at Smash Summit 6 in May 2018.  Mew2King did not lose in the bracket stage, managing to defeat Armada twice, including during the grand finals.  He became the first player to win a Smash Summit event outside of Armada and Hungrybox. Mew2King has since decided to focus most of his efforts on Smash Ultimate, the new title in the Super Smash Bros series. He has received mixed results but most notably placed 25th at Smash Conference United and 9th at Smash Ultimate Summit.

== Background ==
Throughout 2013, Sheeran supported Taylor Swift on her North American Red Tour, as well as performing throughout the show itself. He also is featured on her single, "Everything Has Changed", which was promoted at the Summertime Ball and the final of Britain's Got Talent. While touring, he began recording his second studio album, ×. The album was preceded by the lead single, "Sing", which reached number one in the UK. The album, released on 20 June 2014, received critical acclaim, and Sheeran performed at series of festivals in 2014, including Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park and Southside Festival. On 14 April 2014, following a performance on Saturday Night Live, Sheeran announced his first ever North American arena tour. Beginning in Seattle, the 15-date tour would travel all around North America. Due to demand, three dates were added to the tour (one date at the SAP Center and at the Staples Center in Los Angeles).
During the 2015 leg of the X Tour, Ed Sheeran chose to use a Fender Stratocaster loaned to him by British contemporary artist Teddy M.  The guitar known as Green T featuring graphics by the artist was played in 18 countries and used for the songs requiring an electric guitar including "Thinking Out Loud".  Green T was returned to Teddy M at the end of the X Tour and later auctioned by Bonhams for £12,500 (Dec 2015). https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22818/lot/179/

Known as the 'Crash x Teddy M' Stratocaster, the guitar features the debut of the Teddy M Heart design and Crash's signature eye symbol.

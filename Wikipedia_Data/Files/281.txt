Billy Dukes of Taste of Country described the song as a "mid-tempo love song" and a "beat-driven slice of sultry country and hip-hop love." He also compared its hip-hop and R&B influences to "Burnin' It Down". One Country writer Annie Reuter also found R&B influences in Aldean's performance, saying that it was a "blend of rock and R&B influences" and that it had "soaring guitar parts, seductive beats and his slowed singing style", and that it had a theme about "a long night ahead with his love". Aldean told Nash Country Daily that "I've always loved big guitars and a good groove, but we've never really done it like this before. So, it's cool that we can do that coming off something like ['You Make It Easy' and 'Drowns the Whiskey']."

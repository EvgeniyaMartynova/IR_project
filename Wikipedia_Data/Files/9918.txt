Title: Ohio Arts Council
Aspects: {'OAC'}

The Ohio Arts Council (OAC) is an agency serving the U.S. state of Ohio.


== History ==
Established in 1965, its mission is to "foster and encourage the development of the arts and assist the preservation of Ohio's cultural heritage." Each year it awards grants to arts organizations and individuals throughout the state.  Its headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio.
Since 2003, it has awarded the Ohio Heritage Award each year, an award modeled on the National Endowment for the Arts's National Heritage Fellowship.


== Programs and Operations ==
The State Arts Plan 2015-2017 was created in response to the needs of everyday Ohioans. Informed by focus groups, one-on-one interviews, site visits to organizations and communities, and a statewide survey of all 88 countiesâ€”the State Arts Plan serves as the foundation for the agency's future.
Four actions areas: INVEST, ENGAGE, INNOVATE and LEAD underpin the plan, guiding program prioritization and resource deployment.
The Council operates the Riffe Gallery in the lobby of the Vern Riffe Center for Government & the Arts at 77 S. High Street, near the Ohio Statehouse.

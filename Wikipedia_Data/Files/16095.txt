Title: Y1 (railcar)
Aspects: {'Y1'}

The Y1 is a diesel-hydraulic standard gauge railcar (single self-propelling carriage). It is in use in Croatia, Cuba, Norway, Serbia, Kosovo, Sweden and Uruguay.
The production of the railcars was begun in 1980 by Kalmar Verkstad and Fiat Ferroviaria for Sweden.


== Italy ==
The Y1 is based on the Italian model ALn 668. This diesel railcar was built during the period 1954–1981. 787 vehicles were built in 12 series.


== Sweden ==
SJ, the Swedish railways, needed new diesel railcars for lines like Inlandsbanan. SJ bought this model from Fiat. They were based on an existing model, but modified for Swedish needs. The first were produced in Italy, and later in Kalmar, Sweden. 100 vehicles were made during the period 1979–1981.
There were some variations, with some having a cargo area, needed in the remote parts of northern Sweden where mail and parcels are often transported by passenger buses and trains. They have 68 or 76 seats, but 48 only in those equipped with a cargo area. As first delivered, the vehicles had Fiat engines. During the 1990s several were updated and acquired new Volvo DH10 bus engines.
Many Y1s have been resold to other countries such as Uruguay and some of the former Yugoslavian countries. Today most of the Y1s still in use in Sweden are owned by regional transport authorities, rather than by SJ AB, where they have been replaced by Bombardier Itino trains. The only regular line to use these railcars in regular traffic today is Kinnekullebanan. A number of Y1 railcars are nevertheless stationed at different places around Sweden as reserve trains. The summer-only tourist service on Inlandsbanan also uses these railcars.


== Croatia ==
Classified as series 7122 by Croatian Railways, second-hand examples began arriving from Sweden in 1996, and now total around 35 (in 2017). These units have replaced HŽ series 7221 Šinobus units on branch lines. The 7122s are used in Istria, Dalmatia, and around Bjelovar, Varaždin, Osijek, and Karlovac.
Almost all of the incoming units were repainted in standard orange-black livery. However, from 2007 a new livery silver, blue, and red livery was introduced. Some units are also coloured in white livery, with a blue stripe on the bottom and modern HZPP logo above.


== Serbia ==

Classified as series 710 by Serbian Railways, second-hand examples began arriving from Sweden in 2005. They were all painted in a white, blue, and black livery. The units are being retired as new Class 711 units enter service.


== Norway ==
Norges Statsbaner operated three units on the Bratsberg Line, between Porsgrunn and Notodden, from 2000 until August 2015. Purchased second-hand from Swedish State Railways and painted in a more orangey shade of red than that normally applied to NSB stock, the units were not classified according to the standard NSB system, but were referred to as Y1.


== Kosovo ==
A total of four former SJ Y1 railcars (nos 1281, 1304, 1306, 1313) were sold to Kosovo Railways in 2007  for service on local trains between Pristina and Peć. The cars were renumbered 01, 02, 03, 04 (but still carry their old numbers below the new ones) and are painted in a red and yellow livery.


== Uruguay ==
Five Y1 type railcars were sold to the State Railways Administration of Uruguay. Railcars 1273, 1310, 1317, and 1354 are in use on local services around Montevideo (February 2017), with 1333 out of use. In April 2017, seven more were delivered with one to be used for spare parts.

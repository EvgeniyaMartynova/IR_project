Title: X-League
Aspects: {'X League'}

The X-League (Xリーグ) is the top-level American football league in Japan. It was founded in 1971 as the Japan American Football League, and changed its name to the X League in 1997.  There are three divisions (X1, X2, and X3) among which there is promotion and relegation.  Teams in the three-tier league are split into East, West, and Central divisions. There are two types of teams, one being a company team in which only employees of that particular sponsoring company may participate as a player, and the other classified as a club team for which anyone can try out.
Game rules are based on those of the NCAA college division in the United States, with the exception of the length of quarters, which are 12 minutes instead of 15 during the first stage of the season.
The Japanese national team, which has won the first and second editions of the American Football World Cup and was runner-up, finishing second to the American team, in the 2007 installment of the tournament, was made up almost entirely of players from this league.
Americans are often recruited to play for X League teams, with a strict rule of four per team. No more than two foreign players per team are allowed on the field of play at a time.


== Season format ==
The league is split into 3 tiers: X1 Super, X1 Area and X2

There are two spring tournaments as well which are used by teams to ready themselves and evaluate new players before the fall season. One is the larger Pearl Bowl which teams from eastern Japan compete in, and the other is the Green Bowl for teams in western Japan.


=== Regular season ===
The top tier, X1 Super includes eight teams who will all play each other once in a seven game season. 
The second tier, X1 Area contains 12 teams while X2 comprises 18 teams. The teams in X1 Area will be divided into three groups with each team playing six games, three inside the group and three outside.


=== Postseason ===
At the end of the X1 Super season, the top four teams head into the semifinals. The winners of the semifinals would advance to the Japan X Bowl.
The top two teams in the X1 Area would compete in the X1 Area bowl for the chance to advance to the Area/Super promotional match against the 8th placed X1 Super team.


=== Japan X Bowl ===

The two semifinal winners would meet for the league championship in the Japan X Bowl held at the Tokyo Dome. Since 1987, Japan X Bowl has decided the X League championship. Until 2002, it was known as the Tokyo Super Bowl. The winner of this game goes on to the Rice Bowl to face the winner of the Koshien Bowl, the national college championship game.


=== Relegation/Replacement games ===
The 8th place team from X1 Super would play a relegation playoff game against the winning team from the X1 Area league
The same goes for the last place team in the X1 Area who would play the X2 champion to decide who would be the 12th team in X1 Area

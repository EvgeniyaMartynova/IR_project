== About ==
The Zabriskie Residence is regarded as one of the finest Queen Anne style structures in Omaha. Edgar Zabriskie was a ship officer, American Civil War veteran, Union Pacific general agent and accountant. He was one of the first purchasers of a lot in Bemis Park, a new residential suburb in the 1880s. The house was designed by a firm operated by Benjamin Fowler and Charles Beindorff, who also designed a number of important civic buildings throughout the city. After it was built the Zabriskie Residence and carriage house sat along on a hill overlooking the Bemis Park development for nearly a decade. It was only in the early 20th century did the development grow.The Zabriskie House has multiple wall surfaces, high multiple rooftops, a round turret, straight and round-arched windows and prominent gables and chimneys. The house is currently in excellent condition, including still-functioning original gas lamps throughout the house.

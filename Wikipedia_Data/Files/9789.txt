Title: BMW 5 Series (E60)
Aspects: {'O0'}

The fifth generation of the BMW 5 Series consists of the BMW E60 (sedan/long wheelbase sedan version) and BMW E61 (wagon version, marketed as 'Touring') executive cars. The E60 and the E61 were produced from 2003 to 2010 and are often collectively referred to as the E60.
The E60 generation introduced various new electronic features, including the iDrive infotainment system, head-up display, active cruise control, active steering, adaptive headlights, night vision, lane departure warning and voice control. The E60 was the first 5 Series to be available with a turbocharged petrol engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking.
The M5 model was introduced in 2005 and is powered by the S85 V10 engine. It was sold in the sedan and wagon body styles, with most cars using the 7-speed SMG III transmission. It was the first and only M5 model to be sold with a V10 engine. 
In January 2010, the BMW 5 Series (F10) began production as the successor to the E60.


== Development and launch ==
The development programme for the E60 began in 1997, concluding in 2002. The lead designer was Boyke Boyer. The final design, developed by Davide Arcangeli under BMW Design Director Chris Bangle, was approved in 2000 and German design patents filed on April 16, 2002.The sedan was launched on July 5, 2003 in Europe and in October 2003 in North America. In late 2004, the Touring models were introduced.

The body of the E60 was made using aluminium for the front of the car, and steel for the passenger cabin and rear. Kerb weights are 1,545–1,725 kg (3,406–3,803 lb) for the sedan and 1,675–1,830 kg (3,693–4,034 lb) for the wagon. The weight distribution of the sedan models was 50:50.


== Interior / Equipment ==

The iDrive infotainment system— first introduced in the E65 7 Series— was fitted to all E60 models. The standard iDrive system included a 6.5-inch LCD screen, Bluetooth audio for phone calls, voice control, and vehicle settings. Optional features included an 8-inch LCD screen, satellite navigation and DVD video playback.
An emergency hotline feature (BMW Assist) was also available for the E60. The BMW Assist system could also use the phone network to notify the driver and their preferred BMW dealership when servicing was due.
Other features available in the E60 initially included active cruise control, Bi-Xenon headlights, run-flat tyres, active anti-roll bars and active steering. Safety-related items include Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), adaptive headlights and night vision.
Over the E60's lifespan, the following features were added: Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go, keyless entry ("comfort access"), LED taillights, Lane Departure Warning and Brake Force Display.
The E60 was the first 5 Series in 22 years where the centre console was not angled towards the driver, however the E60's successor returned to angling the centre console towards the driver.In 2003 a 6 speed SMG gearbox was offered as a option on the 525i, 530i, 545i and 550i.

== Special models ==


=== BMW 5 Series Security ===
The E60 5-Series was available as a ‘Security’ model, a factory armoured version produced by BMW AG which was unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show.  Utilising ballistic steel, aramid, polyethylene and 21mm polycarbonate layered glass it was certified at VR4 level of VPAM’s Bullet Resistant Vehicle guidelines (1999), tested by Beschussamt Mellrichstadt. The 5-Series Security was available as a 550i (367PS; 362 hp; 270 kW V8) or 530i (258PS; 254 hp; 190 kW I6) and features upgraded suspension and braking systems.The armoured areas include the entire passenger cell, battery terminals and ECU (Engine Control Unit).  As standard they included an intercom system and panic alarm.
BMW 5 Series Security was manufactured alongside the series model at BMW's Dingolfing plant, with armouring prepared before being shipped to a specialist facility in Toluca, Mexico, where the vehicles complete the final assembly stage.


=== Long-wheelbase sedan (China only) ===
A factory-stretched long-wheelbase version of the E60 5 Series was offered in China. Models included the 520Li, 523Li, 525Li, and 530Li.


=== BMW 5 Series Authority Vehicle ===
The 5 Series Authority Vehicle is designed for police forces, fire services, and emergency rescue services. It has a firearm bracket in the rear center armrest.


== Safety ==

Initially the 5 Series received a three-star rating for adult occupants. However changes were made to the steering column, footrest, door trims, door latch, airbags and electronic software and the car was retested achieving its four-star rating. BMW claims the modifications improved the car's EuroNCAP score, not the vehicle's safety; consequently BMW chose not to recall the earlier-built cars.The American Insurance Institute of Highways Safety (IIHS) gives the 5 Series a "Good" overall rating in frontal collisions but a "Marginal" overall rating for side impact collisions. The IIHS reported their side impact test would likely cause driver related rib fractures and/or internal organ injuries. The IIHS tests were conducted on models built after May 2007; these models had modifications to improve side impact safety.


== 2007 facelift ==
The 'Life Cycle impulse' (LCI) models were introduced in September 2007 (for the 2008 model year). Styling changes were relatively subtle, and included revised headlights, tail lights and front bumper. The interior was significantly revised. The iDrive system was upgraded with programmable "favourite" shortcut buttons (for late 2008 models), a revised menu system, preset buttons for the audio system and the switch from DVD to hard disk based storage.Mechanically, the 5 Series gained the new engines and transmissions from the E70 X5. On automatic transmission models, a shift by wire shifter replaced the mechanical version and shift paddles were available for the first time on a 5 Series model besides the M5.The active cruise control was upgraded to bring the vehicle to a complete stop and accelerate from stationary (called" Stop & Go"). Other changes include adaptive headlights, LED rear lights, Lane Departure Warning, night vision, head-up display and Brake Force Display. The E60 LCI was the first BMW to feature regenerative braking.

This species which has a distribution type: Oceanic Temperate occurs on the coasts of the North Sea, in countries and islands including:

Iceland
Denmark
Sweden
Great Britain
Ireland
France


== Ecology ==
Hydrobia acuta neglecta occurs in coastal lagoons where incoming freshwaters dilute sea water. The preferred salinity range is 10-24 â€° 


== Status ==
The status of this taxon is uncertain.Hydrobia neglecta is treated as a full species in Fauna Europaea but in 1995 it had been suggested that H. neglecta is a synonym of the Mediterranean Hydrobia acuta (Draparnaud). Then a neglecta colony in northern France was shown to be acuta. In (2000) a molecular study concluded that north-west European populations were not specifically distinct from the Mediterranean Hydrobia acuta and designated them subspecies neglecta Muus.

Title: Ha-3-class submarine
Aspects: {'C-class submarine'}

The Ha-3 class submarine (波三型潜水艦, Ha-san-gata sensuikan) was an early class of submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy.


== Background ==
Along with placing orders with Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness in the UK for two British C class submarines, which were commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as the Ha-1 class, the Japanese government ordered another three vessels, which were received as knock-down kits. These kits were assembled at the Kure Naval Arsenal.


== Design ==
Physically almost identical to the Ha-1 class, the three vessels assembled in Japan incorporated a number of improvements, including extended bow  for improved seaworthiness, improved rudder for surface handling, and an increase in the size of the bridge and conning tower.

Aspects: {'UAM'}

Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (Polish: Uniwersytet im. Adama Mickiewicza w Poznaniu, Polish abbreviation UAM) is one of the major Polish universities, located in the city of Poznań, Greater Poland, in the west of the country. It traces its origins to 1611 and officially opened on May 7, 1919. Since 1955, it has carried the name of the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz. The university has been frequently listed as a top three university in the country.In 2018, the Academic Ranking of World Universities placed the university within the 701-800 band globally.


== History ==
On October 28, 1611, under the Royal Charter granted by King Sigismund III Vasa, the Jesuit College became the first university in Poznań. These edicts were later affirmed with charters issued by King John II Casimir in 1650 and King John III Sobieski in 1678. Based on these charters, the university granted scholar degrees to its members. The inauguration ceremony of the newly founded took place on May 7, 1919 that is 308 years after it was formally established by the Polish king and 400th anniversary of the foundation of the Lubrański Academy which is considered its spiritual predecessor. Its original name was Wszechnica Piastowska ("University of the Piasts" – wszechnica being a less common Polish word for "university"), which later in 1920 was renamed Uniwersytet Poznański ("Poznań University").
In 1920 famous sociologist Florian Znaniecki founded the first Polish department of sociology at the university, one of the first such departments in Europe. In the same period of the university's history, botanist Józef Paczoski founded the world's first institute of phytosociology.
After the invasion of Poland, Poznań was annexed by Germany and the University was closed by the Nazis in 1939. It was reopened as a German university in 1941, which operated until 1944. Staff and students of the Polish university, some of them expelled by Germans to Warsaw, opened an underground Polish "University of the Western Territories" (Uniwersytet Ziem Zachodnich), whose classes met in private apartments (see Education in Poland during World War II). Many of the professors and staff were imprisoned and executed in Fort VII in Poznań, including professor Stanisław Pawłowski (rector in the years 1932-33). The Polish university reopened, in much smaller form, after the end of World War II. In 1950, the Medical Faculty, including the Dentistry section and the Faculty of Pharmacy, were split off to form a separate institution, now the Poznań University of Medical Sciences. In 1955 Uniwersytet Poznański adopted a new patron, the 19th-century Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz, and changed to its current name.


== Sites ==
The university's central administrative building is Collegium Minus, on the west side of Adam Mickiewicz Square at the western end of the street Święty Marcin. (This is one of a group of buildings, including the Imperial Palace, built in the first decade of the 20th century while Poznań was still under German rule; it originally housed a Royal Academy.) Adjoining this is the Aula, which is frequently used for ceremonies and for classical music concerts, and Collegium Iuridicum (accommodating the law faculty). Some teaching takes place in Collegium Maius, another of the aforementioned group of buildings (on ul. Fredry), although this is mainly used by the medical university. Other buildings in the city centre include former communist party headquarters on Święty Marcin, Collegium Novum (used mainly for language teaching) on Al. Niepodległości, and the university library on ul. Ratajczaka.
The university also uses a number of other buildings in southern and western districts of Poznań. However it is strongly developing its site at Morasko in the north of the city. As of 2006, the faculties of physics, mathematics and computer science, biology, geographical and geological science had moved to the new location. In 2015 they were joined by the faculty of history (Collegium Historicum Novum).The university also has external branches in other towns of western Poland, including Kalisz, Ostrów Wielkopolski and Słubice.

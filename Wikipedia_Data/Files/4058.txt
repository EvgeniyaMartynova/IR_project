Title: Compaq Presario
Aspects: {'F700'}

Presario was a series of desktop computers and notebooks from Compaq. The Presario family of computers was launched for the consumer marketplace in September 1993.  In the mid-1990s, Compaq began manufacturing  PC monitors as part of the Presario brand. A series of all-in one units, containing both the PC and the monitor in the same case, were also released. Although HP acquired Compaq in 2002, the Presario name was used until the Compaq brand was discontinued in 2013 by HP, due to its marketability issues.

== Monitors ==
The MVX00 and FPX00 monitors were designed to be sold with the Series 3 Designed Compaq towers.  These retained the original spaceship shape of the second generation Compaq Presario towers, except most had smoked-black plastic flip-up doors and a slightly squatter design that was more rounded.  The Generation 2 Presario towers lacked the smoked plastic "easy access" door with USB and audio ports behind it, and had black smoked CD bezel covers.
FP meant "Flat panel display", one of the first offered for a home PC.

The monitors shared the same design cues: All of them had a split lower bezel which ran down the middle, just like the towers they were meant to match. There is a very rare set of monitors (the FX series) which have built-in speakers and a subwoofer, and three extra USB ports. These are designed to go with the 4800 series Presario multimedia towersâ€”specifically the 4830 to 4882, as they were all black like the FX monitor.

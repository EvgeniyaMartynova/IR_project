Title: HMS K17
Aspects: {'K17'}

HMS K17 was a British K class submarine built by Vickers in Barrow-in-Furness.


== Design ==
Like all British K-class submarines, K17 had a displacement of 1,800 tonnes (2,000 short tons) when at the surface and 2,600 tonnes (2,900 short tons) while submerged. It had a total length of 338 feet (103 m), a beam length of 26 feet 6 inches (8.08 m), and a draught length of 20 feet 11 inches (6.38 m). The submarine was powered by two oil-fired Yarrow Shipbuilders boilers and one geared Brown-Curtis or Parsons steam turbine; this developed 10,500 ship horsepower (7,800 kW) to drive two 7 feet 6 inches (2.29 m) screws. It also contained four electric motors each producing 350 to 360 horsepower (260 to 270 kW). It was also fitted with a diesel engine providing 800 horsepower (600 kW) to be used when steam was being generated.The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 24 knots (44 km/h; 28 mph) and a submerged speed of 9 to 9.5 knots (16.7 to 17.6 km/h; 10.4 to 10.9 mph). It could operate at depths of 150 feet (46 m) at 2 knots (3.7 km/h; 2.3 mph) for 80 nautical miles (150 km; 92 mi). K17 was fitted with a 3 inches (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun, ten 18 inches (460 mm) torpedo tubes, and two 4 inches (100 mm) deck guns. Its torpedo tubes were fitted to the bows, the midship section, and two were mounted on the deck. Its complement was fifty-nine crew members.


== Loss ==
K17 was sunk on 31 January 1918 during the night time fleet exercises later known as the Battle of May Island (Operation E.C.1) when she was attached to the 13th Submarine Flotilla. HMS Fearless ploughed into K17 at the head of a line of submarines. She sank in about 8 minutes with the loss of all hands.  The wreck is designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

It begins as ZR Mahabane Highway and goes north-north-east for 35 kilometres to the town of Brandfort. As this first section is operated by SANRAL, there is a Toll Plaza 5 kilometres from the N1 Bloemfontein interchange, at the point where the R30 exits the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality, named the Brandfort Toll Plaza.At Brandfort, the R30 passes through in a northeasterly direction as the main road, passing through Page Park and Brandfort Central and meeting the R703 Route. The R30 continues north-north-east for 38 kilometres to the town of Theunissen, where it bypasses the Lusaka and Masilo suburbs before passing by the town centre and meeting the R708 Route. From Theunissen, the R30 continues northwards for 21 kilometres to reach a junction with the R730, which marks the end of the R30 being a national toll road (the ZR Mahabane Highway maintained by SANRAL continues from this junction as the R730).

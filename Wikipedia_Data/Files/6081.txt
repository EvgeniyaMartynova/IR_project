Title: Highways & Dance Halls
Aspects: {'I Knew I Loved You (disambiguation)'}

Highways & Dance Halls is the third studio album released by American country music artist Ty England. Released in 1999 as his only album for Capitol Records, it is also the only album which he recorded under his birth name of Tyler England.


== Content ==
The tracks "My Baby No Está Aquí No More", "She Don't Care About Me", and "I'd Rather Have Nothing" were later recorded by Garth Brooks on his album The Lost Sessions, while "Travelin' Soldier" — originally cut in 1996 by its writer, Bruce Robison — would become a Number One country hit in 2003 when the Dixie Chicks released it. Also included is a re-recording of England's 1995 hit "Should've Asked Her Faster", re-recorded here with Steve Wariner as a guest musician.


== Critical reception ==
Giving it 3 out of 5 stars, Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic wrote that "What England does lack is vocal enthusiasm, but he makes up for it in originality. Produced by his college buddy Garth Brooks, Highways & Dancehalls [sic] is a verifiable reprieve from the bubble gum music we've gotten used to hearing on radio".

Title: Virginia's 9th congressional district
Aspects: {'VA9'}

Virginia's ninth congressional district is a United States congressional district in the Commonwealth of Virginia, covering much of the southwestern part of the state. The 9th is Virginia's second-largest district in area, covering 9,113.87 square miles (slightly larger than the whole state of New Jersey). Since 2011 it has been represented by Morgan Griffith (R), who took office after defeating Rick Boucher (D), the district's representative for 1983-2011.The largely white district was aligned with the Democratic Party well into the 20th century, when Virginia was among the Solid South states and African Americans were disenfranchised. Since the 1990s its voters have increasingly cast ballots for Republican presidential candidates. It last supported a Democrat for president in 1996, and has supported a Democrat in only two statewide contests since then.  
Republican presidential candidate John McCain received 59% of the vote in the 9th district in 2008, his best performance in any of Virginia's eleven congressional districts. The 9th District is the only district in Virginia that cast more votes for Hillary Clinton than Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Clinton won more than 60% of the vote; local Congressman Rick Boucher endorsed Obama.
As of 2017, the 9th District had the highest poverty rate of any Virginia Congressional District, at 18.7 percent.

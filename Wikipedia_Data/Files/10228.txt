Title: Pseudomonas aurantiaca
Aspects: {'P. aurantiaca'}

Pseudomonas aurantiaca is an orange Gram-negative soil bacterium, originally isolated from the rhizosphere soil of potatoes. It produces di-2,4-diacetylfluoroglucylmethan, which is antibiotically active against Gram-positive organisms. It has shown potential for use as a biocontrol agent against plant-pathogenic microbes. Based on 16S rRNA analysis, P. aurantiaca has been placed in the P. chlororaphis group.

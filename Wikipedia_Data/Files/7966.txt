Title: L'americano (Piccinni)
Aspects: {"L'Americano"}

L'americano (The American) is an intermezzo for four voices in two acts by composer Niccolò Piccinni with an Italian libretto by Angelo Lungi. The opera was premiered on 22 February 1772, at the Teatro Valle in Rome in celebration of Carnival. Musically, this work is unusual as it is much lengthier than most intermezzos and has an abundance of arias but very few ensemble numbers and duets.

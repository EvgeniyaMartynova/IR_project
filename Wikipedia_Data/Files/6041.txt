The song expresses the aftermath of a sad breakup when both ex-lovers are still missing each other. While O'Brien is still in the same emotional place as when they broke up, Gnash has partly been able to move on.


== Music video ==
The music video for "I Hate U, I Love U" premiered on March 7, 2016.


== Critical reception ==
Time was negative towards "I Hate U, I Love U" labeling it as one of the worst songs of 2016 and writing, "Forget The Chainsmokers and Halsey's chart-conquering smash 'Closer'â€”the most depressingly zeitgeist-defining song of 2016 is gnash's piano ballad 'i hate u, i love u,' with singer-songwriter Olivia O'Brien, which inexplicably rose to the Top 10 of the Hot 100 this year. The singsongy melody is obnoxious as an ice cream truck jingle, while the lifeless production drains it of any energy."In 2017, the song was nominated for a Radio Disney Music Award for Best Breakup Song.

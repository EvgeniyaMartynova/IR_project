Title: BMW 1 Series (F20)
Aspects: {'F20'}

The second generation of the BMW 1 Series consists of the BMW F20 (5-door hatchback version) and BMW F21 (3-door hatchback version) compact cars. The F20/F21 generation was produced from 2011 to 2019 and is often collectively referred to as the F20.
For the second generation of 1 Series, the coupé and convertible models were spun off to create the new BMW 2 Series nameplate.
The F20/F21 was initially powered by four-cylinder petrol, four-cylinder diesel and six-cylinder petrol engines. In 2015, three-cylinder petrol and diesel engines were added to the model range. All engines are turbocharged.
Unlike most hatchback competitors, the F20/F21 uses a longitudinally mounted engine and rear-wheel drive (instead of front-wheel drive) for most models. The F20/F21 is the first 1 Series to offer an optional all-wheel drive (called "xDrive" by BMW). The F20 has seen use in the British Touring Car Championship, winning the Constructors' Championship and Teams’ Championship.In China and Mexico, the BMW 1 Series (F52) 4-door sedan was also sold alongside the F20/F21 in the 1 Series range. However, the F52 is largely unrelated to the F20/F21 range, as it  uses the BMW UKL platform, which is front-wheel drive and shared with the MINI, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and X1.In July 2019, the BMW 1 Series (F40) began production as the successor to the F20.


== Suspension ==
Like its E87 predecessor, the F20/F21 uses aluminum multi-link suspension.


== Equipment ==
Available equipment includes satellite navigation with an 8.8 inch screen, iDrive, LED headlights and digital radio.The interior and exterior trim is either Sport Line, Urban Line or M-Sport Line. These trim packages differ by alloy wheels, kidney grille and other appearance-related features.In November 2015, the optional Automatic parking (called "Parking Assistant", where the car steers itself to parallel park) was upgraded.

At the 2015 BMW Group Innovation Days at Miramas proving grounds in southern France, BMW unveiled a prototype model using a water injection engine.The 3-cylinder B38 petrol engine uses a similar approach as the 6-cylinder engine fitted to the production F82 M4 GTS, by spraying a water mist into the intake manifold plenum chamber. The compression ratio is increased from 9.5:1 to 11.0:1, power and torque increased by 10 percent and the engine is compatible with low-octane (RON 95) fuel. Some of the water required for the system is automatically collected from the condensation from the air-conditioning system.To date, no production version has been announced.

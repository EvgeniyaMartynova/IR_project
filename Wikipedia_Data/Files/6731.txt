Japan Asia Airways, Co., Ltd. (日本アジア航空株式会社, Nihon Ajia Kōkū Kabushiki-gaisha) (JAA) was a subsidiary of Japan Airlines (JAL) which existed between 1975 and 2008. JAA was headquartered in the Japan Airlines Building in Shinagawa, Tokyo.JAA was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of JAL on 8 August 1975 and given the responsibility of providing air links between Japan and Taiwan formerly offered by JAL.Direct flights between Japan had been suspended since April 1975, following the signing of a civil air treaty with China. However, following negotiations between the Interchange Association, Japan and Taiwan's Association of East Asian Relations, JAA was created and direct flights to Taipei were resumed.  JAA began flights to Taipei on September 15, 1975.Similar arrangements were later made by Air France, British Airways, KLM, Qantas and Swissair for their services to Taiwan.
In 1985 JAA was headquartered in the Yurakucho-Denki Building in Chiyoda, Tokyo, in a facility apart from the JAL headquarters in the Tokyo Building in Chiyoda.Following JAL's privatization, the new 2007 Japan-Taiwan air transport agreement led JAL to liquidate JAA as a cost-saving measure and to normalize Japan-Taiwan flight status. JAA flew its last flights on March 31, 2008, and all flights were operated by JAL from April 1, 2008.

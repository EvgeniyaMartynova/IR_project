Title: Women's American Basketball Association
Aspects: {'WABA'}

The Women's American Basketball Association (WABA) is a name used by four professional women's basketball leagues in the United States. None as of yet have been able to maintain long-term success.


== WABA (1984) ==
The first Women's American Basketball Association was founded by Bill Byrne, founder of the WBL, in hopes of cashing in on the USA Olympic team's success in Los Angeles in 1984. While some talented players played in the league (including Nancy Lieberman, Molly Bolin, Pamela McGee and Paula McGee) most of the league's teams folded before the league championship, which was won by Dallas over Chicago.


== WWBA/WBA (1992–95) ==
The Women's Basketball Association (WBA) was the first women's professional basketball summer league. The league was called the WWBA and WBA for the first All-Star tour in 1992, before settling on WBA. The pioneer league was formed in 1992 by Lightning N Mitchell and played three full seasons from 1993–95.The WBA played a 15-game schedule and games were broadcast on Liberty Sports of Dallas. The All-Star games were also televised on Fox Sports. Kansas Jayhawks All-American Geri "Kay-Kay" Hart and Robelyn "Robbie" Garcia announced the game on Fox Radio and Nancy Lieberman was the TV announcer for the 1995 All-Star game.
The WBA played three full seasons with plans to play as a 12-team league in 1997, but disbanded before the season began. When Fox Sports purchased Liberty Sports and the WBA, they dissolved the league shortly after and sold off the franchising rights. The league was is first American professional women's basketball league to be successful as a summer league, like their counterpart WNBA.
Guard Laurie Byrd played for the WWBA, WBA, American Basketball League and the WNBA.

The Women's American Basketball Association (WABA) formed in 2001 and played one season in 2002. Six teams played in the league: Allentown Crunch, Reading Rage, Schuylkill Syrens, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Scream, Wilmington Jaguars and York City Noise.
The 2002 championship game was played June 2, 2002 and won by the York City Noise. Meggan Yedsena (who went on to play for the Colorado Chill) led the Schuylkill Syrens in the league's inaugural season. Some of the teams made the transition to the WEBA and continue to play semi-professional Basketball. Yedsena was the only player to play in both the 1990s WABA (for Nebraska) and the 2002 WABA.

== Plot ==
Velu has his livelihood based on the forest nearby, selling firewood collected from the forest to the people in the locality. He believes in nature and conserving it to give the next generation all the resources that they have obtained. Poongodi, a school student, lives in nearby town. She falls in love with Velu and vice versa. Karuna, Velu's friend, aspires to be a forest officer, but being poor, he is unable to cope up the bribe that is needed by the selectors. In desperation, he tries to smuggle sandalwood for an agent but gets caught. He requests Velu to take his place so as to not ruin his chance of getting his dream job. The amiable Velu agrees, not realizing that his friend might not be the man that he is posing to be. Velu comes across Nandha, a political leader and social reformist in the jail where he is imprisoned. Under Nandha's guidance, Velu transforms into a different man. Here, things take a turn in his life. Meanwhile, Karuna tricks the DFO, becomes a forest officer, and tries to take over the forest for his personal gains by driving away the people of the forest. In the crossfire between the government and the smugglers, the gullible villagers are exploited by both the parties. Velu gets bail and fights against Karuna and the smugglers to save the villagers from migrating to the city for survival and forest from the smugglers. The movie ends with a message that if we are not going to take care of our forests and continue to ravage it, then nature would hit us with such power that humankind would not be able to withstand its onslaught.

== History ==
The station opened on August 1, 1922, as the Yakushidō Signal Stop (薬師堂停留場) on the Yokojō Railway. The Yokojō Railway became the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) Yashima Line on September 1, 1937, at which time the signal stop was elevated to a full station. The JGR became the Japanese National Railways (JNR) after World War II. The Yashima Line was privatized on 1 October 1985, becoming the Yuri Kōgen Railway Chōkai Sanroku Line, at which time the station regained its original name. A new station building was completed in October 2009.

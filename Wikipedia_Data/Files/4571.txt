Title: Suzuki G engine
Aspects: {'G13'}

The Suzuki G engine is a series of three- and four-cylinder internal combustion engines manufactured by Suzuki Motor Corporation for various automobiles, primarily based on the GM M platform, as well as many small trucks such as the Suzuki Samurai and Suzuki Vitara and their derivatives.

=== G10/G10 Turbo ===

The G10 (sometimes referred to as the "G10A" to set it apart from the later G10B) is a 1.0 L (993 cc) straight-three gasoline four-stroke engine using aluminum alloy for the block, cylinder head and pistons. It is equipped with either a carburetor or electronic fuel injection and was also offered as the G10T with an IHI RHB31/32 turbocharger and either MPFI or a carburetor. It has a single overhead camshaft driving six valves. Cylinder spacing is 84 mm (3.31 in), as for the four-cylinder G13/G15/G16 engines.
A 74 mm × 77 mm (2.91 in × 3.03 in) bore and stroke give the engine a total of 1.0 L; 60.6 cu in (993 cc) of displacement. It produces 48 hp (36 kW; 49 PS) at 5100 rpm and 77 N⋅m (57 lb⋅ft) at 3200 rpm with 9.5:1 compression in the carbureted model, 55 hp (41 kW; 56 PS) at 5700 rpm and 79 N⋅m (58 lb⋅ft) at 3300 rpm in the fuel-injected model. The original home market version originally offered a carbureted 60 PS (44 kW; 59 hp) JIS at 5500 rpm, later power output fluctuated around 52–55 PS (38–40 kW; 51–54 hp).
From 1984 to 1988 the standard G10 engine used a hemispherical head carbureted design with mechanical lifters. From 1989 to 2001 the engine received updates in the form of throttle-body fuel injection and hydraulic lifters. A detuned 49 hp (37 kW; 50 PS) unit, with a slightly different camshaft, two-ring pistons and differently tuned engine control unit, was used in the ultra-fuel-efficient Geo Metro XFi model, which delivered as much as 58 mpg‑US (4.1 L/100 km; 70 mpg‑imp). In the US, the G10 in the 2000 Chevrolet Metro became the last engine available on an American-sold vehicle to use throttle body injection for fuel delivery.
Through the 1985-1991 model years a turbocharged MPFI version of the G10 was offered in some markets. This engine delivered 70 hp (52 kW; 71 PS) at 5500 rpm and 79 lb⋅ft (107 N⋅m) at 3500 rpm. This turbocharged engine, with mechanical lifters, was available in both the US and Canadian Firefly/Sprint/Forsa from 1987-88. Only the Canadian Firefly/Sprint had this option, with hydraulic lifters, in the 1989-1991 model years. In the Japanese domestic market, the car was originally carbureted (80 PS (59 kW; 79 hp) JIS at 5500 rpm, 118 N⋅m (87 lb⋅ft) at 3500 rpm) and went on sale in June 1984. In October 1987, along with a facelift, the home market Turbo received fuel injection and power output went up to 82 PS (60 kW; 81 hp) JIS, torque to 120 N⋅m (89 lb⋅ft). It was a short-lived version, however, as by September 1988 the car was no longer on sale in the Japanese domestic market. As the only market in the world, Canada did continue to receive this engine for its versions of the second generation Cultus.
Because of the physics of the straight-three engine, the G10 tends not to idle as smoothly as other engines such as a straight-six engine. This engine has a non-interference valvetrain design.

=== G10B ===
G10B was an all-aluminium engine. It was a four-cylinder 1.0 L (993 cc) 72 mm × 61 mm (2.83 in × 2.40 in) SOHC 12-valve engine and is an all-aluminium engine. It was sold in both carburetted and MPFI form. It was widely used in motorsport in India due to its light weight and tunability. The mounting points of the engine block were similar to that of the G13 and so an engine swap was a relatively easy task. It was phased out when production of Zen ceased in 2006. It was made only in India but was sold in all countries the Zen was sold.


=== G12 ===
The G12B is an inline-four engine using aluminum alloy for the block, cylinder head and pistons. It is derived from the G13BB engine by reducing the bore to 71 mm (2.80 in) to displace 1.2 L (1,196 cc). Stroke remains the same at 75.5 mm (2.97 in). It has a SOHC 16V head and the fuel delivery is by multi-point fuel injection. It is Euro-4 emissions compliant. It has lighter pistons and other detail improvements to be a more fuel efficient engine than the G13BB on which it is based. Maruti modified the engine to displace less than 1200 cc to take advantage of the reduced excise duty on such vehicles in India.

2016–present– Maruti Suzuki Super Carry (CNG only)


=== G13 ===
The G13 is an inline-four engine using aluminum alloy for the block, cylinder head and pistons. Displacing 1.3 L (1,324 cc) for the G13A and 1.3 L; 79.2 cu in (1,298 cc) for all other G13 engines, fuel delivery is either through a carburetor, throttle body fuel injection or multi-point fuel injection.
This engine was made with different valvetrain designs: 8 or 16 valve SOHC or 16 valve DOHC. All G13 engines have a bore and a stroke size of 74 mm × 75.5 mm (2.91 in × 2.97 in) except for the G13A engine which has a 77 mm (3.03 in) stroke. There was also a 1,360 cc (1.4 L; 83 cu in) "G13C variant built in Indonesia, combining the longer stroke with a 75 mm (2.95 in) bore.


==== G13A ====
The SOHC 8-valve G13A has a non-interference valvetrain design.
It was used in the following vehicles:

November 1984– Suzuki Cultus AB51S

==== G13B ====
This DOHC 16-valve engine is well known, it uses the older distributor driven off the intake camshaft, and produces approximately 100 hp (75 kW; 101 PS) at 6500 rpm / 112 N⋅m (83 lb⋅ft) at 5000 rpm. Redline is set at 7400-7600 rpm. This engine has an interference valvetrain design, making periodic timing belt changes vital to the engine's life.

1990– Suzuki Cultus AB34S
1989– Suzuki Swift AC34S DOHC
2000– Suzuki Every Plus GF-DA32W


==== G13BA ====
The SOHC 8-valve G13BA has single-point fuel injection and produces 50 kW (68 PS; 67 hp) and 74 lb⋅ft (100 N⋅m) of torque. It has a non-interference valvetrain design. 1995 to 1997 U.S. and Canadian-market engines gained hydraulic lash adjusters.
It was used in the following vehicles:

1989 Suzuki Sidekick
1994–2000 Maruti Esteem
1994–2004 Subaru Justy
1989–1997 Suzuki Swift
1992–1997 Geo Metro
1990–1995 Suzuki SJ413
1989–1993 Holden Barina - (carburetor: 71 hp (53 kW; 72 PS) at 6,000 rpm; 102 N⋅m (10 kg⋅m; 75 lb⋅ft) at 4,000 rpm)


==== G13BB ====
The SOHC 16-valve G13BB (introduced in March 1995) has electronic multi-point fuel injection (MPFI), generating 56–63 kW (76–86 PS; 75–84 hp) and 104–115 N⋅m (11–12 kg⋅m; 77–85 lb⋅ft). The G13BB uses a wasted spark arrangement of two coils bolted directly to the valve cover.
This engine uses a MAP sensor to monitor manifold pressure, similar to the G16B series. This engine has a non-interference valvetrain design. It uses the same G series block found in many other Suzuki models and so it is a popular conversion into the Suzuki Sierra/Samurai/Jimny 4WD, which uses either a G13A (85-88) or G13BA(88.5-98). This allows the engine to fit into the engine bay simply as engine and gearbox mounts are identical and both engines are mounted North-South.
It was used in the following vehicles:

1995– Suzuki Cultus Crescent
1998–2003 Suzuki Jimny, Suzuki Swift
1998–2007 Maruti Esteem
2000–present Maruti Gypsy King
Ultralight aircraft [1]


==== G13C ====

Maximum power was listed at 73 PS (54 kW) at 6000 rpm in 1999. This engine was developed by Suzuki's Indonesian subsidiary and was not used anywhere else. It was first used in the 1991 Suzuki Carry Futura.It was used in the following vehicles:

Title: Inel Qaghan
Aspects: {'Qaghan'}

Inel Qaghan or Inel Khagan (Old Turkic:𐰃𐰤𐰀𐰴𐰍𐰣, Chinese: 拓西可汗; pinyin: Tuoxīkèhán) was a ruler of the Second Turkic Khaganate. 


== During Qapaghan's reign ==
He actively participated in his father's campaigns. He became lesser khagan and received from his father 40,000 troops of the western wing, so the Chinese called him Tuoxi Khagan (拓西可汗, literally the expander of the west) in 699.
He took part in battles involving Muslim conquest of Transoxiana between 711-712. He was also present in Siege of Beiting, where his brother Tonga Tekin was killed in 714.


== Reign ==
He was killed by Kul Tegin during struggle for the throne. Some writers say that the law of succession was that power passed from a ruler to his younger brothers before returning to his sons. Thus the order was Ilterish Qaghan, his brother Qapaghan Qaghan, then his sons Bilge Qaghan and Kul Tegin. Inel, being Qapaghan's son, had no right to the throne. Other writers treat the matter as a coup d'état with no mention of the rules of succession.

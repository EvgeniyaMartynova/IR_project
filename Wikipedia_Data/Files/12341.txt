Title: Jamaican poorwill
Aspects: {'S. americanus'}

The Jamaican poorwill (Siphonorhis americana), also known as the Jamaican pauraque or Jamaican least pauraqu√©, is a species of nightjar in the family Caprimulgidae. It is endemic to Jamaica. Its natural habitats are tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. It is critically endangered or possibly already extinct due to a combination of introduced predators and habitat destruction.

The first formal description of the Jamaican poorwill was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Caprimulgus americanus.

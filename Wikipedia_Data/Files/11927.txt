Title: Caudron R.11
Aspects: {'R11'}

The Caudron R.11, (mis-identified in Jane's 1919 as the Caudron R.II), was a French five-seat twin-engine bomber, reconnaissance and escort biplane developed and produced by Caudron during the First World War.


== Development ==
The R.11 was originally intended to fulfill the French Corps d'Armee reconnaissance category. Its design was similar to the Caudron R.4, but with a more pointed nose, two bracing bays outboard the engines rather than three, no nose-wheel, and a much larger tail.   The engines were housed in streamlined nacelles just above the lower wing.


== Operational history ==
The French army ordered 1000 R.11s.  Production began in 1917, with the first aircraft completed late in that year.  In February 1918 the first Escadrille (squadron) R.26 was equipped.  The last escadrille to form before the Armistice (and abrupt end of production) was R.246, at which point 370 planes had been completed.


== Variants ==
The Caudron R.12 was an experimental version of the R.11, with a larger engine. Development ended when the Caudron R.14 variant appeared in August 1918.

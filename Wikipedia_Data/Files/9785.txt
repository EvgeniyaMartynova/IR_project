== History and legacy ==

Owens & Minor initially opened as a drug company on the streets of downtown Richmond, Virginia in 1882, inside a historic building which still stands today. The company continued this business for over half a century, until in 1954 Gil Minor, Jr., bought out Bodeker Drug Company, a smaller operation in the same industry. Within a few years, the company grew steadily, and Owens, Minor & Bodeker was a leading member in the industry.In 1966, expansion came with the acquisition of local A&J Hospital Supply. This was the company's initial entrance to the market of medical and surgical distribution. By 1970, OMB had opened Cardinal Drug Centers to provide merchandising for more independent drug companies, and within two years the stores stocked more than 25,000 items. Around this time, disposable items were administered to hospitals for various medical procedures. G. Gilmer Minor III, of direct relation to the founder, became CEO in 1984. By 1988, Owens & Minor began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker OMI. It was around this time that revenues earned the company a Fortune 500 title.By 1999, the corporation had refocused its pursuits towards medical supply chain management. Through consulting, providing solutions, and acting as a middle man between medical providers and vendors, Owens & Minor revolutionized the medical care process, streamlining efficiency and costs for both sides of the medical world. Throughout the 2000s, Owens & Minor acquired various medical distributors across the United States, notably the hospital distributor McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., a business unit of McKesson, for $152.1 million, on September 30, 2006. In 2012, Owens & Minor entered the European market, opening offices in Spain, France, Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic after the acquisition of Movianto Group. In 2014, the corporation acquired ArcRoyal, a privately held medical kit company based in Dublin, Ireland.In 2018, Owens & Minor acquired Halyard Health’s Surgical & Infection Prevention business.  The $710 million acquisition gives Owens & Minor a leadership position in the Surgical & Infection Prevention products segment. Halyard is a manufacturer of sterilization wrap, facial protection products, exam gloves, protective apparel, surgical drapes and surgical gowns. This is the largest acquisition in Owens & Minor’s history. Owens & Minor annually employs around 17,000 dedicated teammates serving healthcare industry customers in 90 countries.

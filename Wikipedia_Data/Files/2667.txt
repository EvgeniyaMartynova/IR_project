Aspects: {'D15'}

Dublin 15, also rendered as D15, is a postal district in the suburbs of Dublin in Fingal, Ireland. It is 11 km (6.8 mi) west of the GPO in Dublin city.


== Geography and political subdivisions ==
Dublin 15 covers a large  area, rising from the River Liffey to 93 metres (305 ft) at the townland of Cloghran near the Rosemount Business Park. The district is bordered by County Meath to the west and the north-west and by the Ratoath Road to the north-east. The land between the Ratoath Road / Cappagh Road and the M2 / N2 road lies in the Dublin 11 postal district. The townland of Ashtown and the boundary walls of the Phoenix Park is the district's eastern boundary. The Liffey forms the southern limit with the anomalous exception of that part of Dublin 20 that contains the village of Chapelizod. 
Dublin 15 is almost entirely contained within the county of Fingal. Administrative offices of Fingal County Council are located in the grounds of the Blanchardstown Shopping Centre.
For the purposes of elections to Dáil Éireann, the district is entirely contained within the Dublin West constituency. Only three district electoral divisions of the constituency lie outside Dublin 15: Kilsallaghan, Lucan North and Swords-Forrest.Dublin 15 borders four postal districts; Dublin 11 and Dublin 7 to the east; Dublin 20 and Dublin 8 to the south. 
The district overlaps at many points with the historic barony of Castleknock. Three civil parishes of the barony are not in Dublin 15; Ward, Chapelizod and St James'; the five remaining parishes are contained in the district.

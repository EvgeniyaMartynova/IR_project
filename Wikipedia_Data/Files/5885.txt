Aspects: {"I Don't Want to Know (disambiguation)"}

Gold Medal is the sixth studio album by the American hard rock band The Donnas, released in 2004 on Atlantic Records. It was one of the first albums released in the  DualDisc format, but was recalled due to a mastering error which resulted in the final track being partially omitted from the CD side of the album. The DualDisc version of the album came with a black velvet limited edition cover slip and the music video for "Fall Behind Me" on the DVD side.
Their single, "Fall Behind Me", was featured as the background song for the new 2006 Nissan Xterra and 2006 U.S. Women's Olympic Snowboarding Team TV commercials. "I Don't Want to Know" is in the Gran Turismo 4 soundtrack and a cover of the song was also used for Donkey Konga 2 for the Nintendo GameCube. "I Don't Want to Know" was also used as the theme song for the first season of The-N's hit series, "South of Nowhere". "Friends Like Mine" was used in trailers & TV spots for the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.

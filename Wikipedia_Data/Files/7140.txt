== Services ==


=== Scheduled flights ===
With its base in Don Mueang, Kan Air operated daily and weekly scheduled service to destinations in northern, northeastern, and central Thailand.


=== Charter flights ===
With its base at Don Muang International Airport, Kan Air provided a more direct route to a desired location than a commercial flight. Chartering a private jet allows passengers to fly on their schedule, fly to smaller airfields closer to their final destination, and avoid the queues and chaos of major airport terminals.

Kan Air  signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with National Institute of Emergency Medicine to transport critically ill patients.

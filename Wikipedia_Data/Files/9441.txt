Title: North American NA-16
Aspects: {'NA-16'}

The North American Aviation NA-16 was the first trainer aircraft built by North American Aviation, and was the beginning of a line of closely related North American trainer aircraft that would eventually number more than 17,000 examples.


== Design and development ==

The NA-16 is a family of related single-engine, low-wing monoplanes with tandem seating.Variants could have an open cockpit (the prototype and the NA-22) or be under a glass greenhouse that covered both cockpits. On some variants, the rear of the canopy could be opened for a gunner to fire to the rear. A variety of air-cooled radial engines, including the Wright Whirlwind, Pratt & Whitney Wasp and Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior of varying horsepowers, could be installed depending on customer preferences. The fuselage was built up from steel tubes and normally fabric covered; however, later versions were provided with aluminium monocoque structures.During the development of the design, a six-inch stretch was made by moving the rudder post aft. Many versions had a fixed landing gear, but later versions could have retractable gear, mounted in a widened wing center section (which could have either integral fuel tanks or not). Most had a straight trailing edge on the outer wing while again, some had the wing trailing edge swept forward slightly in an attempt to fix a problem with stalls and spins. Several different rudders were used, with early examples having a round outline, intermediate examples having a square bottom on the rudder (Harvard I) and late examples using the triangular rudder of the AT-6 series, due to a loss of control at high angles of attack with the early types. Horizontal and vertical tails were initially covered in corrugated aluminum, but later examples were smooth-skinned, and the horizontal stabilizer was increased in chord near its tips on later versions.The NA-16 flew for the first time on 1 April 1935, and was submitted to the United States Army Air Corps for evaluation as a basic trainer. The Army accepted the trainer for production but with some detail changes. The modified NA-16 was redesignated by North American as the NA-18, with production examples entering Air Corps service as the North American BT-9 (NA-19). Similar aircraft continued to be sold outside the U.S. under the NA-16 designation.


=== Foreign developments ===
AustraliaThe Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation produced 755 units of a modified version of the NA-16-2K known there as the Wirraway between 1939 and 1946.
ArgentinaExperience with the NA-16-4P and deteriorating political relations with the US led to the local development of the I.Ae. D.L. 21, which shared the NA-16 fuselage structure; however it proved too difficult to produce. As a result of this, an entirely new design (the I.Ae. D.L. 22) was built instead; it had similar configuration, but was structurally different and optimized to available materials.
JapanThe NA-16-4RW and NA-16-4R inspired the development of the Kyushu K10W when the Imperial Japanese Navy instructed Kyushu to develop something similar. The resulting aircraft owed little to the NA-16, however Allied Intelligence saw so few examples that the error was not corrected and some drawings show a modified NA-16.


== Variants ==

Listing includes aircraft built specifically under NA-16 designation for export, and similar aircraft built for use by the United States armed forces.

NA-16
One for United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) (trials) developed into NA-18 and BT-9 series.
powered by Wright R-975 WhirlwindWhen the North American NA-16 was first conceived, five different roles were intended for the design, designated NA-16-1 thru NA-16-5:
NA-16-1
General purpose two-seat aircraft - which became the Harvard I
NA-16-2
Two-seat fighter - produced under licence in Australia as the CAC Wirraway.
NA-16-3
Two-seat light attack bomber. The first aircraft in this category was the retractable gear NA-26 which evolved into the NA-36 (BC-1). The fabric-covered fuselage was replaced by an all-metal monocoque to create the NA-44, which provided the basis for a line of light attack bombers whose improvements would result in the AT-6.
NA-16-4
Advanced trainer - became the BT-9 for the USAAC and which provided the bulk of early production. The improvement of the BT-9 with a longer metal skinned fuselage as on the NA-44 would create the NA-64 (Yale) and improved wings would result in the BT-14.
NA-16-5
Single-seat fighter - although this designation was never used, it became the NA-50 for Peru, and later the NA-68, which saw limited USAAF service as the P-64.BT-9 (NA-19)

== Surviving aircraft ==
The only intact surviving example of an American built NA-16 is the NA-16-2A/NA-20 "FAH-21" displayed at the Honduran Aviation Museum at Toncontín.
A Swedish NA-16-4M (locally designated as Sk 14) was built from an ex-RAAF CAC Wirraway (s/n A20-223) with additional parts from an ex-RCAF North American NA-64 Yale and is on display at the Swedish Air Force Museum.
The CAC Wirraway (originally NA-16-2K) was first modified to British standards and equipment, then later models diverged further from the NA-16 in minor details such as the fitting of dive brakes etc. The sole surviving CA-1 Wirraway is A20-10, the 8th production Wirraway, effectively a licence built NA-16-2K, and held at the Australian National Aviation Museum  Ten Wirraways are on the Australian civil aircraft register. Further examples (in Australia unless noted) are at Temora Aviation Museum, Australian National Aviation Museum, Aviation Heritage Museum, Museum of Victoria, Queensland Air Museum, RAAF Museum (Stored) and the Fantasy of Flight (Florida - stored).

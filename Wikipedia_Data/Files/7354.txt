Title: KKCW
Aspects: {'K103'}

KKCW (103.3 FM, "K103") is a commercial broadcast radio station licensed to Beaverton, Oregon and serves the greater Portland metropolitan area.  The transmitter is located in Portland's west hills, while studios are in Tigard, Oregon.  The station's format is Adult Contemporary.


== History ==
In 1984, KKCW intended to sign on with a country music format. The C and W in the call letters stood for country and western, but music station KUPL beat them to the punch. Although KKCW has been programming adult contemporary since its inception, it has adapted to the changing tastes among its listeners by moving away from the softer product to a fresher musical library (given the competition it has from Adult Top 40 rivals KRSK and KBFF).

== History ==
From 1963-1981, the WAC baseball champion was determined by a best of three playoff between the division champions.
The WAC baseball tournament first started in 1982.  It began as a double elimination tournament involving the top two finishers in each division.  The conference kept this format through 1987.
In 1988, the conference discontinued divisional play and the top four finishers in the regular season advanced to the double elimination tournament.  This format lasted through 1992.
Divisional play again resumed in 1993.   The conference did not hold a tournament and instead opted for a best of three playoff between the two divisional winners to determine the champion.
In 1997 and 1998, the WAC began a six-team tournament that included the winners of each of three divisions, along with three at-large teams.
In 1999, the WAC once again eliminated divisional play. The top six finishers in the regular season advanced to the tournament. 
There was no tournament from 2000 until 2005.
In 2006, the WAC brought back a tournament and the top six finishers in the regular season advanced to the postseason.

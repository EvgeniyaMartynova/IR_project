Title: G10 currencies
Aspects: {'G10'}

The G10 currencies are ten of the most heavily traded currencies in the world, which are also ten of the world's most liquid currencies. Traders regularly buy and sell them in an open market with minimal impact on their own international exchange rates.
The origin of the term G10 currencies is not clear, however it may be derived from the G-10 countries and their agreement to participate in the IMF General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB). There is no longer a one-to-one match between the G10 currencies and the G10 countries.
The G10 currencies are:
United States dollar (USD)
Euro (EUR)
Pound sterling (GBP)
Japanese yen (JPY)
Australian dollar (AUD)
New Zealand dollar (NZD)
Canadian dollar (CAD)
Swiss franc (CHF)
Norwegian krone (NOK)
Swedish krona (SEK)In some banking circles, reference is made to the G11 currencies, which are the G10 currencies plus the Danish krone.

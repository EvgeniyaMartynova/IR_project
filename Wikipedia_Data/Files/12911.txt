Title: Rover T-series engine
Aspects: {'T series'}

The Rover T16 engine was a 2.0 L; 121.7 cu in (1,994 cc) fuel injected DOHC inline-four petrol engine produced by Rover from 1992 to 1999. It has a bore and a stroke of 84.45 mm × 89 mm (3.325 in × 3.504 in). It is a development of the M series (M16), which was in turn a development of the O series, which dated back to the BMC B-series engine as found in the MG B and many others. Several variants were produced for various models, but all had the same displacement. The naturally aspirated type produced 136 bhp (101 kW; 138 PS), and turbocharged types were available with 180 and 200 bhp (134 and 149 kW; 182 and 203 PS).
While the engine itself is capable of a great deal of power, its limiting factor was the PG1 Powertrain Ltd gearbox it was coupled with which could not handle the torque. As a result, the engine is electronically limited to a lower torque output than it is easily capable of, giving the engine a very 'flat' overall torque curve.


== Applications ==
The Rover 620ti Turbo, 220 turbo coupé and 820 Vitesse all utilised the engine. The T-series engine also found its way into limited-run Rover 220 3-door hatchbacks in GTi and later GSi trims and the 420 GSI turbo and GSI Sport turbo. The T-series engine is a popular engine for engine conversions in to other Rover-MG vehicles i.e. MG ZR, MG ZS etc. It can also be adapted to a rear-wheel drive layout using a Rover LT77 or R380 transmission.
The non-turbo engine also found its way into the short-lived and generally underpowered Land Rover Discovery 2.0i. Land Rover also fitted the same engine to a special batch of Defenders built for the Italian Carabinieri, which operated an exclusively petrol-powered vehicle fleet. A development vehicle was also built using a turbocharged version of the engine which far out performed the V8 production cars, but no room could be found for it in Land Rover's vehicle strategy.

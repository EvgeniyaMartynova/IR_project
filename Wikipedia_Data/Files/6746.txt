In April 2007, Korvi Rakshand, a law school student, started a movement with some friends to distribute relief to the flood victims at the slums of Rayer Bazaar in Dhaka city. Later he expanded this program to establish the JAAGO Foundation with the hope of 'breaking the cycle of poverty through education'. Although JAAGO originally started out by providing free of cost primary school education to the children of Rayer Bazaar, Dhaka it slowly started to expand its activities all over Bangladesh.

Title: List of courthouses in the United States
Aspects: {'U.S. Post Office and Courthouse'}

This is a list of courthouses in the United States.  American courthouses are very often significant, as they are public buildings usually built to convey solidity and to command respect.  Many have hosted important trials, or are significant for their architecture, and thus many have been designated as historic sites.
This list includes state, county, city, town and other municipalities' courthouses, as well as subsuming U.S. Federal courthouses (which are also listed at List of United States federal courthouses).  There are no known courthouses of international scope located in the U.S.

Historically Mississippi may have had a county court in each of its 82 counties but in 2016, Mississippi has just 19 county courts.  There are in fact at least five distinct types of non-Federal courts in Mississippi:

County courts are created by the state legislature to reduce the workload of circuit courts and chancery courts.  Adams County Court, for example, has one County Court judge, and has "exclusive jurisdiction over matters involving eminent domain, unlawful entry and detainer, youth courts and partition of personal property."  It also "shares jurisdiction with Justice Court in all matters, civil and criminal [and it] also shares jurisdiction with the Circuit and Chancery Courts in all matters of law and equity up to $200,000. The County Court Judge also hears non-capital felony criminal cases transferred by the Circuit Court."
Circuit courts have "original jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters not vested exclusively in another court", and most circuit court cases are handled by juries.
Chancery courts cover "domestic/family matters, divorce, child custody, property division, adoptions, alimony, estates of descendants, land issues (titles, contracts), emancipation (declaring a minor to be 21 for work purposes), property title confirmation, property disputes (over $50,000), insurance settlements to minors, and commitments of mentally disabled."
Justice courts covers traffic tickets, civil cases including small claims and felony cases through initial appearances and preliminary hearings.
Youth court covers "matters involving delinquent children, children in need of supervision, and neglected and/or abused children."County and other non-Federal courthouses, historical and current, include:

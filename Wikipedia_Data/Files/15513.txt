Title: Fujifilm X-mount
Aspects: {'X-mount'}

The Fujifilm X-mount is a type of interchangeable lens mount designed by Fujifilm for use in those cameras in their X-series line that have interchangeable-lenses. These lenses are designed for 23.6mm x 15.6mm APS-C sensors.
Various lens manufacturers use this mount, such as Fujinon (Fujifilm, XF and XC lenses), Carl Zeiss AG (Touit lenses), Samyang Optics, Handevision, SLR Magic, Viltrox and Zhongyi Optics. There also is an adaptor to allow compatibility with Leica M lenses and third-party options have also been announced.  Additionally, a host of adapters for a range of SLR lenses are available, allowing the mounting of lenses (without autofocus or auto aperture) from Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Minolta, Contax/Yashica, Konica and more. This mount type should not be confused with the discontinued Fujica X-mount, which is not compatible with the newer X-mount without an adapter."By mounting the lens deeper inside the camera, closer to the sensor, resolution is increased across the frame. Information exchange between the body and lens ensure a responsive experience at all times."

=== Carl Zeiss lenses ===
The Touit line of compact lenses from Carl Zeiss AG is purposely designed for APS-C like camera bodies. The optics of these lenses are designed by Carl Zeiss, but the design for manufacturing is done by the Japanese manufacturer Cosina. The Touit lenses are produced for a Fujifilm X-mount and Sony E-mount. Because Fujifilm doesn't publish the specifications of the X-mount, Carl Zeiss never received officially the license for releasing X-mount lenses. The Touit lenses are therefore non-certified.

Title: Sonic Origami
Aspects: {'I Hear Voices'}

Sonic Origami is the 20th studio album by British rock band Uriah Heep and was released in September 1998.
The opening track, "Between Two Worlds", is dedicated to David Byron and Gary Thain, both members of Uriah Heep who died at a young age. It is the final Uriah Heep album to date to feature long-standing drummer Lee Kerslake, due to ill health forcing his departure from the band in 2007.
The limited edition version of the CD contains one additional track.

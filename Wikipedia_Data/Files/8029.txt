== Plot ==
Nathalie teaches philosophy in a Parisian high school, but for her it is not just a job, it is a way of living and thinking. With a past permeated with youthful idealism, it now aims to teach students how to think with their own head, subjecting them to philosophical texts that stimulate confrontation and discussion. Her life flows between her husband, her two children, an ex-model mother who needs constant attention and her dedication to philosophical thought. But suddenly everything changes: the husband leaves her, her mother dies and Nathalie finds herself in control of an unexpected and unusual freedom.

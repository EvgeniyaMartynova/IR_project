The University of A Coruña (Galician: Universidade da Coruña) is a Spanish public university located in the city of A Coruña, Galicia. Established in 1989, university departments are divided between two primary campuses in A Coruña and nearby Ferrol. The A Coruña campus is spread over three suburbs on the outskirts of A Coruña: Elviña and Zapateira (near the site of the Battle of Elviña) and Oza (near the As Xubias zone).


== History ==
The first University in Galicia was founded 1495 in University of Santiago de Compostela, and it remained the only university in Galicia until the early 1980s when two university campuses (in A Coruña and Vigo) were formed from the University of Santiago de Compostela.
In the early 1960s, the School of Naval and Industrial Engineers of Ferrol was also established as a degree-granting institution by a Ministerial Order. Until 1990 the school was directly dependent on the Ministry of Education in Madrid. In 1990 the school was amalgamated with the University of A Coruña.
In the late 1980s, the two campuses of A Coruña and Vigo, originally part of University of Santiago de Compostela, became fully independent universities with the authority to issue their own university degrees.
In the early 1990s, the universities established further campuses of their own:

University of Santiago de Compostela based in Santiago de Compostela, with a campus in Lugo
University of A Coruña based in A Coruña, with a campus in Ferrol
University of Vigo based in Vigo, with campuses in Ourense and Pontevedra

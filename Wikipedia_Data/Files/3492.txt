Title: Renault F-Type engine
Aspects: {'F-type'}

F Renault engine (F for fonte, French for cast iron) is an automotive internal combustion engine, four-stroke, inline-four engine bored directly into the iron block, water cooled, with overhead camshaft driven by a timing belt, and with an aluminum cylinder head, developed and produced by Renault in the early '80s, making its appearance on the Renault 9 and 11. This engine is available in petrol and diesel versions, with 8 or 16 valves.


== History ==
In December 1982, the Renault Board proposed a new 1,596 cc (1.6 L) diesel engine with 55 bhp (41 kW; 56 PS) for the Renault 9. Known as "F8M", the new engine was designed by engineer George Douin and his team and broke with tradition by featuring no removable cylinder liners, thanks to advances in metals technology that significantly slow the wear of rubbing mechanical parts. The new 4- cylinder unit adopted an overhead camshaft driven by a toothed belt that also controls the diesel injection pump. A second belt rotates the alternator and water pump, while a vacuum pump located at the rear operates the brake servo. The cast iron block is topped by a light alloy cylinder head featuring Ricardo Comet prechambers. The engine is mounted transversely inclined rearwards 12°. A few months after the release of the Renault 9 Diesel, the Renault 11 was launched in April 1983, the diesel version being introduced in autumn 1983.
In the autumn of 1983, Renault launched the 1,721 cc (1.7 L) F2N petrol engine, using the block of the F8M. It has a diesel-type architecture, with combustion chambers integrated with the piston design. Since the petrol version does not require water channels in the block, a bigger bore was possible than in the smaller diesel version. It first appeared in twin carburettor form in the Renault 11 GTX, TXE, and the TXE Electronic with digital meter and speech synthesis. In February 1984, " F2N " was added to the Renault 9 GTX and TXE. This engine was called the B172 by Volvo.
Thereafter, the F8M was also used in the Renault 5 Express (Rapid/Extra), and the Volvo 300 series. The F2N was installed in the Renault 21, Renault 5, Renault 19, Renault Clio, Volvo 340/360 and also the Volvo 400 series (where it was designated B18KP by Volvo). A version with a single-barrel carburetor was installed in some early Renault Trafic models and some R21, called the F1N. The 1,721 cc (1.7 L) petrol version was also built with multi-point fuel injection as the F3N. This was fitted to the U.S. versions of the Renault 9 and Renault 11 (Renault Alliance and Encore), as well as to GTE models of the Renault 5 and 11 sold in some countries such as Switzerland and Germany - as the old carburetted turbo Cléon-Fonte engines no longer met the pollution standards in these countries.
Volvo built turbocharged versions of the F2N with multipoint fuel injection (designated "B18FT"), installed in the Volvo 480 Turbo, the 440 Turbo Volvo and Volvo 460 Turbo. These engines are sought after to fit to Renault 5 GT Turbo, Renault 9 Turbo and Renault 11 Turbo.
Production is centered on Renault's engine manufacturing facility at Cléon, near Rouen in Normandy.


== Evolution ==


=== Diesel versions ===
Beginning in 1987, the 1.6D undergoes changes to make it more quiet. This F8M second generation will unfortunately be weaker at the cylinder head and head gasket. More asbestos will be dropped, which will exacerbate the problems of cylinder head gaskets. Externally, a second generation F8M detected by its cylinder head cover 6 which is secured by small screws, while a first generation F8M 3 has closed nuts for securing the valve cover, the housing for dispensing a F8M second generation part has a non-painted around the injection pump, while a first generation F8M the casing has completely black distribution.
In 1988, Renault launched the Renault 19 in place of R9 and R11, the F8M 1.6 D developing 55 bhp (41 kW; 56 PS) diesel engine of its predecessors is not powerful enough to equip the heavier R19, Renault changes the race and bore of 1.6 D, to obtain 1,870 cc (1.9 L) (1.9 D) which will give rise to F8Q developing 65 bhp (48 kW; 66 PS). This engine will also equip engine eventually the Clio 1, Clio 2 Express (Rapid / Extra), R21, Kangoo, Megane 1 and Traffic 1. A deflated version producing 55 PS (40 kW; 54 bhp) DIN will appear in the 90s. The problems keep F8Q heads and heads of seals F8M second generation.
At the end of 1988, a turbocharged version of the 1.9 D is sold on the R19, the engine will F8QT engine types, it will develop 95 bhp (71 kW; 96 PS) DIN. It will also equip Megane 1, and the Volvo 440, Volvo 460, Volvo S40 and V40, and Mitsubishi Carisma.
In the fall of 1997, Renault team are 1.9 dT a Direct injection, which gave birth to the first Renault engine with direct injection, the 1.9 dTi, it will take F9Q engine types. It will equip the Mégane 1 1 Scénic, Laguna 1, Clio Kangoo 1 and 2, and the Volvo S40 and V40.
In July 1999, his team 1.9 dTi the principle of common rail high pressure, giving birth to the first dCi engine, the 1.9 dCi kind F9Q. It will appear on the Laguna 1 Phase 2. The 1.9 dCi also equip the last two phases 1 Mégane Scénic 1 Phase 2, Laguna 2, 2 Mégane, Scénic 2, Area 3, Area 4, Traffic 2, Master 2, Volvo S40, Volvo V40, Suzuki Grand Vitara, and Nissan Primera ...


=== Gasoline versions ===
In 1986, the Renault 21, 2.0 appears, with a displacement of 1,965 cc (2.0 L), F2R type such as a twin-barrel carburetor and F3R type injection version. The F3R of 1,965 cc (2.0 L) also equip Renault Alliance GTA in North America.
In early 1989 Renault premiered the sports version of the Renault 19, replacing the Renault 9 Turbo and Renault 11 Turbo, although it only went on sale in the second half of 1990. Renault abandons its legendary 1.4 Cléon-Fonte turbo carburetor in favor of a multi-valve engine with multipoint injection, an evolution of the engine of the 1,721 cc (1.7 L) F2N. The stroke remains the same, but the bore is increased by 1 mm, giving a displacement of 1,764 cc (1.8 L). The cast-iron block is topped by a 16-valve alloy cylinder head. This, the F7P engine has 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp) and was also used in the Clio 16S from February 1991, replacing the Super 5 GT Turbo. In July 1992, the Clio 16S and 16S R19 are fitted as standard with a catalytic converter in order to comply with pollution standards applicable from 1 January 1993, losing three horsepower in the process.
Clio Williams appeared in 1993. As its name suggests it, the Renault Clio Williams was not designed to celebrate titles gleaned in Formula 1 with the team of Frank Williams, but before any approval for competition (2500 minimum copies required). In order to run in Group A, Renault needs a 2.0-liter engine to be the best equipped in its class. So starting the engine block F7P the Renault Clio 16S Renault will develop its 1,998 cc (2.0 L) F7R 150 bhp (112 kW; 152 PS). The increase in capacity will then pass logically by reaming of 0.7 mm (0.028 in) and with the adoption of a Clio diesel crankshaft to get the race 83.5 to 93 mm (3.29 to 3.66 in). This crankshaft "road" original thus better cash constraints to the increased torque will now reach 175 N⋅m (129 lb⋅ft) at 4,500 rpm. The F7R also equip Mégane 1 and Renault Spider off.
At 1 January 1993, all species cars must be equipped with a fuel injection system and a catalytic converter, on this occasion the F2N of 1,721 cc (1.7 L) see its increased bore and has a cylinder capacity of 1,794 cc (1.8 L). It will bring the engine such as "F3P" on the Renault Clio 1 and 19, and "B18U" on the Volvo 440 and Volvo 460. In contrast, the Renault 21, then at retirement retains its 1,721 cc (1.7 L), but with the injection (type motor F3N), Volvo will also retain the 1,721 cc (1.7 L) injection (type motor B18EP), alongside the new 1,794 cc (1.8 L). In 1994, the Laguna will be equipped with one engine F3P.
Volvo also marketed a 1,596 cc (1.6 L) petrol version with multipoint injection, sold as the "B16F" in Volvo nomenclature. It was installed in the Volvo 440 and 460 models. Peculiarly, this engine has the same bore and stroke (and resulting displacement) as the diesel F8M engine.
Version 8 valves engine F7R 115 bhp (86 kW; 117 PS) will appear on Laguna 1, it will also equip the Mégane 1 Scenic Area 1 and 3, it will be known as "F3R." The Volvo 440, 460 and 480, this engine will be known as "B20F". The new 1,998 cc (2.0 L) F3R replaced the old 1,965 cc (2.0 L) F3R engine.
The F4P first appeared in 1998, in the Phase 2 model of the first generation Laguna. This new 16 valve 1.8 L (1,783 cc) also equips the first Mégane Scénic and the second generation Laguna. At the same time, the bigger F4R is installed in the Laguna and Espace (third generation), the engine is the same size as the F7R 1,998 cc (2.0 L) as in the Clio Williams. It ends up also being installed in the second and third generation Mégane as well as the second Laguna. The specificity of F4P and F4R engines is that they have a 16-valve cylinder head, similar to the K4J and K4M versions of K-Type engine, over the F4P and F4R engines share the same distribution kit and even water pump that K-Type engine 16 valves (K4J and K4M).
In 1999, the F5R engine appeared. This is an F7R engine, equipped with direct injection. This 16 valve DI engine is installed in the Megane coupé and convertible, as well as the Laguna 2. This was the first production French petrol engine with direct injection.
In 1999, Renault launched the Clio 2 RS, powered by the 1,998 cc (2.0 L) F4R 16 valve engine with 172 PS (127 kW; 170 bhp). The engine, sourced from the Laguna, was tuned by Mecachrome and fitted with 2-stage variable valve timing on the intake cam, matched inlet and exhaust ports and 4-into-1 exhaust headers. In 2001 the Phase 2 F4R received electronic throttle control. In 2004, the Phase 3 version of the Clio 2 RS gained 10 PS (7 kW; 10 bhp) for a total of 182 PS (134 kW; 180 bhp) using 4-2-1 exhaust headers, changes to the intake manifold and exhaust system (the new twin rear mufflers requiring the removal of the spare wheel well in the boot). Power increased further in 2006 for the Clio 3 RS, now with 197 PS (145 kW; 194 bhp), using further improvements to intake and exhaust, notably continuously variable valve timing on the intake cam. Output for the Clio 3 increased again to 203 PS (149 kW; 200 bhp) for the Phase 2 model of the third generation Clio RS.
The F4R will also be grafted with a turbo, and will be known F4Rt it will equip two Mégane, Laguna 2, Laguna 3 Avantime and Vel Satis, but especially this basis used for the Megane 2 RS 225 bhp (228 PS; 168 kW) (230 bhp (233 PS; 172 kW) version of the F1 Team R26 and R26.R).
The Megane RS 3 is presented in March 2009 at the Geneva show. It is equipped with the 2.0 16V Turbo block F4Rt the Megane 2 RS with variable valve timing, increased to 250 bhp (253 PS; 186 kW). In June 2011, Renault launched a limited edition "RS Trophy 'power increases by 15 to 265 bhp (15 to 269 PS; 11 to 198 kW).

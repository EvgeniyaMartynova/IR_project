Title: Yallahs River
Aspects: {'Yallah'}

The Yallahs River is a river in the parish of Saint Thomas, Jamaica.
Major landslides have developed in the Upper Yallahs River Watershed. As a result, the river carries a greater silt load and scours its banks far more quickly. The Yallahs Ford downstream has widened tremendously, leaving the coastal route vulnerable to inundation after heavy rainstorms.

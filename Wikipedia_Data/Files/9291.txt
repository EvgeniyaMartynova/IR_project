Title: Nikon F65
Aspects: {'N65'}

The F65 (known as the Nikon N65 in the U.S. and the Nikon U in Japan) is a 35mm film SLR camera introduced by Nikon in 2001. Like its predecessor, the F60, it was aimed at the lower end of the amateur autofocus SLR market.
Its features included autofocus, various forms of TTL light metering and different operating modes. It also included depth-of-field preview and remote shutter release, two facilities notably absent in the F60.
The F65D variant featured a date/time-imprinting facility.
In 2002, the F65 was joined by the F55, which was targeted at a new, lower price point.

Title: Catascopia terebra
Aspects: {'S. occultus'}

Catascopia terebra (Westerlund, 1885) (formerly known as Catascopia occulta) is a species of air-breathing freshwater snail, an aquatic pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Lymnaeidae, the pond snails.


== Taxonomy ==
Some authors classify this species as Stagnicola terebra, because the genus Catascopia Meier-Brook & Bargues, 2002 should not be distinguished based on DNA analysis only (genera should be distinguished morphologically and anatomically).


== Distribution ==
This species of snail is found in the Czech Republic in two localities only: in a small temporary pool near Kladruby nad Labem in the Eastern Bohemia and in temporary pool near the inflow of the Dyje River into the Morava river in Moravia, Germany, Poland and other areas.


== Habitat ==
It inhabits freshwater bodies.

Title: A Little Bit (Nina Åström song)
Aspects: {'A Little Bit (disambiguation)'}

"A Little Bit" was the Finnish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2000, performed in English by Nina Åström.  It was selected as the Finnish entry by the jury over Nightwish's "Sleepwalker" even though "Sleepwalker" placed first in the televote.
The song was performed twentieth on the night, following Macedonia's XXL with "100% te ljubam" and preceding Latvia's Brainstorm with "My Star". At the close of voting, it had received 18 points, placing 18th in a field of 24, thus disqualifying Finland from the 2001 contest.
The song deals with the feeling of love one has towards one's place of birth, regardless of where it might be.
It was succeeded as Finnish representative at the 2002 contest by Laura with "Addicted To You".

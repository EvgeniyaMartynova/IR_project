Title: I Love the '70s (British TV series)
Aspects: {"I Love the '70s"}

I Love the '70s is a television mini-series produced by the BBC that examines the pop culture of the 1970s. It was broadcast in ten hour-long episodes, one dedicated to each year, with the first episode, I Love 1970, premiering on BBC Two on 22 July 2000, and the last, I Love 1979, premiering on 23 September 2000. On the original broadcasts, each episode was followed by the host introducing a film from that particular year.
The series proved successful and thus was followed by two similar series, I Love the '80s and I Love the '90s, both of which aired during 2001.
The "I Love..."-series spawned a US version, aired by VH-1. Part of the series was repeated in the spring of 2012 on BBC Two as part of a special season dedicated to the 1970s.
The episode 'I Love 1975" is the only episode that was interrupted due to a power failure on 30 June 2001, and as concluded as part of the years that  BBC Two suffered problems (2000, 2001, and 2003).

Title: L-Line (Norfolk Southern)
Aspects: {'L Line'}

The L-Line is a rail line that runs from Winston-Salem, North Carolina to Mooresville, North Carolina and it is owned and operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway; the line is part of the Piedmont Division. The line crosses the S-Line at Barber, North Carolina, where most trains are based out of. The line's end point at Mooresville is joined with the O-Line which runs from Mooresville to Charlotte, North Carolina.The majority of the trains on the L-Line are locals, running trains as far north as Clemmons, but other trains can use this line if needed.
The line is very rarely used between Clemmons and Winston-Salem but NS still lists it as fully operational on its website. However it is disconnected from the K-Line at milepost zero. The Peters Creek Trestle in Winston-Salem was the catalyst for shuddering this section. As of 2019 it has not been repaired.

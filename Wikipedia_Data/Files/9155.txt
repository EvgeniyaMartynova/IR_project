Title: Nissan Latio
Aspects: {'N17'}

The Nissan Latio is an automotive nameplate which is used by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan since 2004 for two unrelated subcompact four-door sedans.
Since 2004, the name "Nissan Tiida Latio" had been used for the Japanese market Nissan Tiida sedan, although the Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean markets received this model badged "Nissan Latio". As of 2013, the Tiida-based model is still sold in these markets.
The Latio name for the Japanese market was, in 2011, transferred to a new generation of subcompact sedan sold internationally under a plethora of alternative names.


== Nameplate predecessor ==

The sedan version of the first generation Nissan Tiida was marketed in Japan as the "Nissan Tiida Latio" from 2004. Both the sedan and hatchback Tiida were marketed in Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore as "Nissan Latio" starting in 2005. The Tiida Latio was replaced in the Japanese market by the N17 model in 2012, although the C11 Latio remains on sale in Southeast Asia as of 2014.


== Overview ==
Latio is the Japanese market name for a subcompact sedan unveiled by Nissan in 2010 as the Sunny, but sold under several different names across export markets when sales began in 2011. The Sunny N17 (or L02B using Nissan's new code scheme) was unveiled at the 2010 Guangzhou International Motor Show. The new model utilises the Nissan V platform and weighs less and has gained more legroom compared to its predecessor, the Tiida C11 sedan.

=== Asia ===
The Thai-specification model was released as the Nissan Almera on 7 October 2011, as a vehicle in the Eco-Car project of the Board of Investment of Thailand (BOI). It uses the same 1.2-liter engine as the Nissan March (Micra), with a fuel consumption of 5 L/100 km (56 mpg‑imp; 47 mpg‑US), and has either a five-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT).
The Almera is also built in Santa Rosa, Laguna, Philippines. Other Asian countries receive the Nissan Almera, including Malaysia and Singapore where it is offered with the 1.5-liter HR15DE engine, mated with either a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission.
The Japanese market model was released as the Nissan Latio, imported from Thailand, on 5 October 2012. That car's release was delayed due to power shortages in Japan caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. It has the model code DBA-N17. For the Japanese market, the Latio is sold with a 1198 cc engine producing 79 PS (58 kW) and 106 N⋅m (78 lb⋅ft). It is offered with three trim levels. The Latio was discontinued in Japan on 26 December 2016, due to poor sales.
In India, Renault sells a slightly modified version as the Renault Scala. It was launched in August 2012 and is built at the same factory as the Nissan Micra. The Latio is also sold in India under the moniker, Nissan Sunny.
In Indonesia, the Almera is used only as a taxi, not for private use.
In Malaysia, the N17 Latio is sold as the Nissan Almera and was launched in October 2012. Three variants were offered: E (manual and auto), V (auto only) and VL (auto only). All variants were powered by Nissan's HR15DE engine. During the 2013 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show, Nismo accessories became available. Accessories consisted of a five-piece bodykit, exhaust muffler, Nismo's sports suspension and 16" alloy wheels. The facelift N17 Latio was launched in Malaysia in January 2015. Three variants remained offered and during the launch, it was reported that 56,000 pre-facelift Almera's were sold. Between April 2015 and April 2016, the 1.5 V variant was quietly discontinued.

The Australian model was released as the Almera in August 2012. The model range is powered by a 1.5-liter petrol inline-four engine. Sales were low, with a high proportion of sales to fleet and rental car buyers. Nissan Australia discontinued the Almera in July 2014. Trim levels available were the entry-level ST with a five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic and the automatic-only TI specification.


=== Americas ===
The US-spec model was unveiled at the 2011 New York International Auto Show as the second generation Nissan Versa. It is powered by a 1.6-liter petrol that delivers around 80 kW (107 bhp) of power and 145 newton metres (107 lb⋅ft) of torque. The fuel economy is estimated to be 30 mpg‑US (8 L/100 km; 36 mpg‑imp) city and 38 mpg‑US (6 L/100 km; 46 mpg‑imp) highway with the CVT-equipped model. In the US, Versa sedan went on sale in August 2011 with prices starting at US$10,990; higher spec models include Bluetooth, navigation system with five-inch touch screen display, satellite radio and an iPod/USB interface. It was considered to be the least-expensive new car in the US market in 2013.For the 2015 model year, the Versa (as for the Latio and other models) received its facelift, with redesigned taillights and larger headlamps. The model is also sold in Latin America as the Versa, also with a 1.6-liter petrol engine.
It was succeeded by the Nissan Micra in 2014 for the Canadian market; the Versa was discontinued there due to slow sales.
In 2016, the Versa was sold in Mexico as the next generation replacement of the discontinued Nissan Sunny B13 (known locally as Tsuru), with many dealerships offering discounts and special promotions for fleet owners, taxicab and Uber drivers. Thanks to these campaigns, the Versa became in 2017 the best-selling car in Mexico.

Title: Clinical urine tests
Aspects: {'R&M'}

Clinical urine tests are various tests of urine for diagnostic purposes. A urinalysis (UA) is one of the most common methods of medical diagnosis. The word is a portmanteau of the words urine and analysis. Other tests are urine culture (a microbiological culture of urine) and urine electrolyte levels.
There are three basic components to urinalysis: gross examination, chemical evaluation, and microscopic examination. 
Gross examination targets parameters that can be measured or quantified with the naked eye (or other senses), including volume, color, transparency, odor, and specific gravity.
A part of a urinalysis can be performed by using urine test strips, in which the test results can be read as color changes. Another method is light microscopy of urine samples.


== Target parameters ==
Urine test results should always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test, or using information provided by the test strip/device manufacturer.


=== Color ===

The following are examples of some urine colors and their causes (not a complete listing).

Nearly colorless: Excessive fluid intake for conditions; untreated diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and certain types of nephritis.
Yellow: Distinctly yellow urine may indicate excessive riboflavin (vitamin B2) intake.
Yellow-amber: Normal.
Yellow-cloudy: excessive crystals (crystalluria) and/or excessive pus (pyuria).
Orange: Insufficient fluid intake for conditions; intake of orange substances; intake of Phenazopyridine for urinary symptoms.
Red: Leakage of red blood cells or of hemoglobin from such cells; hemolysis; intake of red substances.
Dark:
Reddish-orange: Intake of certain medications or other substances.
Rusty-yellow to reddish-brown: Intake of certain medications or other substances.
Dark brown: Intake of certain medications or other substances; damaged muscle (myoglobinuria due to Rhabdomyolysis) from extreme exercise or other widespread damage, possibly medication related; altered blood; bilirubinuria; intake of phenolic substances; inadequate porphyrin metabolism; melanin from melanocytic tumors; presence of an abnormal form of hemoglobin, methemoglobin.
Brownish-black to black: Intake of substances or medications; altered blood; a problem with homogentisic acid metabolism (alkaptonuria), which can also cause dark whites of the eyes and dark-colored internal organs and tissues (ochronosis); Lysol (a product that contains phenols) poisoning; melanin from melanocytic tumors). Paraphenylenediamine is a highly toxic ingredient of hair dye formulations that can cause acute kidney injury and result in black urine.
Purple due to Purple urine bag syndrome.
Magenta to purple-red: Presence of phenolphthalein, a stimulant laxative previously found in Ex-Lax.
Green, or dark with a greenish hue: Jaundice (bilirubinuria); problem with bile metabolism. Recent surgery requiring high doses of Propofol infusion. The use of a medication (Uribel) that is similar to phenazopyridine for the relief of urinary symptoms.
Other colors: Various substances ingested in food or drink, particularly up to 48 hours prior to the presence of colored urine.


=== Smell ===

The odor (scent) of urine can normally vary from odorless (when very light colored and dilute) to a much stronger odor when the subject is dehydrated and the urine is concentrated. Brief changes in odor are usually merely interesting and not medically significant. (Example: the abnormal smell many people can detect after eating asparagus.) The urine of diabetics experiencing ketoacidosis (urine containing high levels of ketone bodies) may have a fruity or sweet smell.


=== Ions and trace minerals ===
A sodium-related parameter is fractional sodium excretion, which is the percentage of the sodium filtered by the kidney which is excreted in the urine. It is a useful parameter in acute kidney failure and oliguria, with a value below 1% indicating a prerenal disease and a value above 3% indicating acute tubular necrosis or other kidney damage.


=== Proteins and enzymes ===


=== Blood cells ===


=== Other molecules ===


=== Other urine parameters ===


=== Drugs ===

Urine may be tested to determine whether an individual has engaged in recreational drug use. In this case, the urinalysis would be designed to detect whatever marker indicates drug use.


== History ==
Helen Murray Free and her husband, Alfred Free, pioneered dry reagent urinalysis, resulting in the 1956 development of Clinistix (also known as Clinistrip), the first dip-and-read test for glucose in urine for patients with diabetes. This breakthrough led to additional dip-and-read tests for proteins and other substances. The invention was named a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in May 2010.


== Methods ==
When doctors suggest/prescribe a urinalysis, they will request either a routine urinalysis or a routine and microscopy (R&M) urinalysis, with the difference being a routine urinalysis does not include microscopy or culture.


=== Urine test strip ===
A urine test strip can quantify:

Leukocytes – with presence in urine known as leukocyturia
Nitrite – with presence in urine known as nitrituria
Protein – with presence in urine known as proteinuria, albuminuria, or microalbuminuria
Erythrocytes – with presence in urine known as hematuria
Specific gravity
Glucose - with presence in urine known as glucosuria
Bilirubin - with presence in urine known as bilirubinuria
Ketones - with presence in urine known as ketonuria


=== Microscopic examination ===

The numbers and types of cells and/or material such as urinary casts can yield a great detail of information and may suggest a specific diagnosis.

Hematuria – associated with kidney stones, infections, tumors and other conditions
Pyuria – associated with urinary infections
Eosinophiluria – associated with allergic interstitial nephritis, atheroembolic disease
Red blood cell casts – associated with glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or malignant hypertension
White blood cell casts – associated with acute interstitial nephritis, exudative glomerulonephritis, or severe pyelonephritis
(Heme) granular casts – associated with acute tubular necrosis
Crystalluria – associated with acute urate nephropathy (or acute uric acid nephropathy, AUAN)
Calcium oxalatin – associated with ethylene glycol, kidney stone disease
Waxy casts – associated with chronic renal disease


=== Other methods ===
Urine culture – a microbiological culture of urine samples, detecting bacteriuria, is indicated when a urinary tract infection is suspected.
Ictotest – this test is used to detect the destruction of old red blood cells in the urine.
Hemoglobin test – this tests for hemolysis in the blood vessels, a rupture in the capillaries of the glomerulus, or hemorrhage in the urinary system, which cause hemoglobin to appear in the urine.

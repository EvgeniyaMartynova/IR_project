Title: Al-Hajj
Aspects: {'Q22'}

Al-Ḥajj (Arabic: الحج‎, "The Pilgrimage, The Hajj") is the 22nd chapter (sūrah) of the Qur'an with 78 verses (āyāt).
Verses [Quran 2:62], [Quran 5:69] and [Quran 22:17] address the Jews, Christians and Sabians. 
According to the Shafi'is and Hanbalis, this is the only surah to have two prostrations of recitation, however the Hanafis and Malikis do not recognise the second apparent sajda.

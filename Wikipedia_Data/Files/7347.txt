Title: List of state highway spurs in Kansas
Aspects: {'K-84'}

The Kansas state highway system includes and has included many state highway spurs that connect through highways with places that are not along a through highway. The Kansas Department of Transportation and its predecessor agencies have established most of these highways to serve small cities. In most cases, the spur highway connecting a through route with a city ends at the city limit of the city. The spur highways also serve unincorporated villages, state institutions like psychiatric hospitals, state parks and other Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism–administered facilities, and historic sites.


== K-22 ==

K-22 is a 3.087-mile-long (4.968 km) spur route that serves the city of Haddam in west central Washington County.

== K-46 ==
K-46 was a 1.315-mile (2.116 km) north–south spur of US-56 that served the town of Little River. K-46 first appeared on the 1937 Kansas highway map. It was removed from the highway system on June 3, 2013.


== K-67 ==
K-67 is a 0.972-mile-long (1.564 km) spur route that serves the Kansas Department of Corrections Norton Correctional Facility east of Norton in central Norton County. The highway begins at US-36 and K-383, which run concurrently east–west, and immediately has a grade crossing of the Kyle Railroad. K-67 passes along the east side of the state prison and crosses Prairie Dog Creek before reaching its northern terminus at the next section line road. K-67 has existed since at least January 1938. Before K-67 provided access to Norton Correctional Facility, the highway served Norton State Hospital on the same site. The state hospital closed in 1988.


== K-71 ==
K-71 is a 4.581-mile-long (7.372 km) spur route that serves the city of Bern in north central Nemaha County. The route begins at an intersection with K-63 and heads east to Bern, where it ends at an intersection with 216th Road and Matthews Avenue.


== K-72 ==
K-72 was a spur route that served the city of Basehor. The highway began at US-24 and US-40 and ran northward to the Basehor city limits. The Kansas Department of Transportation removed K-72 from the state highway system in 1973 and it is now known as 155th Street.


== K-76 ==
K-76 was a 0.325-mile-long (0.523 km) spur route that served the unincorporated village of Williamstown in southeastern Jefferson County. The highway began at Railroad Avenue just north of the Union Pacific Railroad. K-76 headed north along Oak Street to a four-way intersection with US-24 and US-59. From that intersection, US-24 headed west toward Perry, US-59 headed north toward Oskaloosa, and the two U.S. Highways headed southeast concurrently toward Lawrence. K-76 has existed since before 1951, when the Kansas State Highway Department approved a relocation of US-24 on the north side of Williamstown through a May 23, 1951, resolution. This project moved the US-24–US-59–K-76 intersection south, and US-59 took over the northern part of K-76's course. The Kansas Department of Transportation removed K-76 from the state highway system through a January 3, 2014, resolution.


== K-78 ==
K-78 is a 1.057-mile-long (1.701 km) spur route that serves the unincorporated village of Miller in northeastern Lyon County. The highway begins at a junction of section line roads on the northern edge of the village. K-78 heads north to its end at US-56 between Admire and Osage City. A spur to Miller has been part of the state highway system since at 1936. K-78 was assigned to the Miller spur by January 1938 at the latest.


== K-79 ==
K-79 is a 3.561-mile-long (5.731 km) spur route that serves the city of Circleville in north central Jackson County. The route begins at an intersection with K-16 and heads north to Circleville, where it ends at an intersection with 254th Road and K Road.


== K-80 ==

The highway begins just north of Railroad Avenue in the village, from which the road continues south as 4th Street. K-84 crosses the South Fork Solomon River on its way to its northern terminus at US-24 between Hoxie and Hill City. The main east–west highway of Graham County crossed the South Fork Solomon River at Penokee on its course between Morland and Hill City in 1918. However, by 1932, that highway followed US-24's present course, and a spur route may have been in place south to Penokee. K-84 was assigned to the Penokee spur by January 1938 at the latest.


== K-85 ==
K-85 is a 0.800-mile-long (1.287 km) spur route that serves the city of Morland in west central Graham County.

K-85 crosses the South Fork Solomon River on its way to its northern terminus at US-24 between Hoxie and Hill City. The main east–west highway of Graham County followed the south side of the South Fork Solomon River at Morland on its course between Hoxie and the village of Penokee in 1918. However, by 1932, that highway followed US-24's present course, and a spur route may have been in place south to Morland. K-85 was assigned to the Morland spur by January 1938 at the latest.


== K-88 ==
K-88, also known as 29th Terrace, is a short 0.466-mile-long (0.750 km) state highway located entirely within Marshall County in the U.S. state of Kansas.

The road continues south as Main Street, which contains a variety of historic sites, including its post office, museum and former railroad station, a pair of historic homes, and the Bernhard Warkentin Homestead, which is a National Historic Landmark. K-89 heads north by Riverside Park—the site of the Old Settlers Picnic and of filming for the 1955 movie Picnic—along Hertzler Memorial Highway, which honors "Horse and Buggy Doctor" Arthur E. Hertzler. The highway passes through an S-curve to veer east onto a section line road, which the highway follows to its end at US-50 between Burrton and Newton. The Kansas State Highway Commission approved a purchase order for right of way to construct K-89 on September 13, 1932. The highway was built in the second half of 1934 as an improved dirt road that was partially funded by national recovery grants. However, before the state had paved the highway, the commission decided to eliminate several sharp curves in the highway's planned course and return the unused land to the former property owners in a November 15, 1935, resolution. K-89 was paved on its present course by 1936.


== K-90 ==
K-90 was a 2.180-mile-long (3.508 km) spur route that served Leavenworth State Fishing Lake.

== K-114 ==
K-114 is a 0.9-mile-long (1.4 km) spur route that serves the city of Ogden in southwestern Riley County. The highway begins at the east city limit of Ogden; the road continues southwest as Riley Street. The highway curves southeast as a four-lane divided highway, crosses a Union Pacific rail line, and reaches its eastern terminus at a partial cloverleaf interchange with K-18, a four-lane freeway that heads northeast toward Manhattan and southwest toward I-70 and Junction City. K-114 was proposed as part of a May 9, 1973, Kansas State Highway Commission resolution to remove K-18 from its course through Fort Riley in favor of a route around the military base between Ogden and Junction City to separate military traffic and regular highway traffic. K-18 would be placed on its present corridor from just east of Ogden south to I-70, and the piece of K-18 between the city of Ogden and the new portion of K-18 would become K-114. The junction of K-18 and K-114 would be a partial interchange featuring a flyover ramp for westbound K-18 and no access from K-114 to westbound K-18 or from eastbound K-18 to K-114. K-114 was established when construction on the K-18 link between Ogden and I-70 was completed between 1975 and 1977. Between 2010 and 2013, K-18 and K-114 were relocated and their present interchange was constructed.


== K-114 (1950–1966) ==
K-114 was a 0.376-mile-long (0.605 km) spur route that served the city of Everest in southeastern Brown County. The highway began at US-73 and K-20, which ran concurrently east–west, between Horton to the west and Huron and Denton to the east. K-114 headed north to the south city limit of Everest, from which the road continued north as Fifth Street. The Kansas State Highway Commission accepted K-114 into the state highway system through a July 12, 1950, resolution. The commission authorized relocations of US-73 and K-20 in and around Everest through an August 12, 1964, resolution. The eastern end of K-20's concurrency with US-73 had been southeast of Everest. The state-numbered highway would be relocated to pass through Everest, assume the course of K-114, and reach its new US-73 junction at what was K-114's southern terminus. K-114 was replaced by K-20 when the relocations were completed in 1966.


== K-115 ==
K-115 is a 0.650-mile-long (1.046 km) spur route that serves the city of Palmer in south central Washington County.

== K-130 ==

K-130 is a 7.818-mile-long (12.582 km) spur route that serves the cities of Hartford and Neosho Rapids in Lyon County. K-130's southern terminus is a continuation as Commercial Street at the Hartford City limits, and the northern terminus is at I-35 and US-50 north of the City of Neosho Rapids. K-130 was originally a section of K-57, but in 1951 K-57 was realigned furthur south. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began building the John Redmond Dam on June 18, 1959 and then in 1962 K-130 was realigned slightly between Hartford and to make room for the new reservoir. The dam went into service on November 17, 1964.


== K-131 ==

K-131 is a 0.521-mile-long (0.838 km) spur route that serves the city of Lebo in northwestern Coffey County. The highway begins at the north city limit between Sixth and Seventh streets, from which the road continues south as Ogden Street. K-131 heads north to a diamond interchange with I-35 and US-50, which run concurrently east–west, between Emporia and Ottawa. The Kansas State Highway Commission accepted K-131 into the state highway system from Coffey County through an August 24, 1949, resolution. The section of highway began at US-50S south of the city and went north 0.560 miles (0.901 km) to Sac and Fox Street and Ogden Street at the south city limit of Lebo. This highway is now named Old Highway 131. On November 14, 1968, the Kansas State Highway Commission approved a lengthy resolution adding and removing several designations in Lyon, Coffey, Osage, and Franklin counties as part of plans to construct I-35 between Emporia and Ottawa. The resolution removed US-50 from its old course and placed it on I-35, and it also changed K-131's route from its southern approach to Lebo to its current northern approach. The change in routing in K-131 and the other highways went into effect in 1973 when I-35 was completed from east of Emporia to Ottawa.

The highway begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-70 and US-40, which run concurrently east–west, between Alma and Maple Hill. K-138 heads east and gradually approaches a Union Pacific Railroad line and then closely parallels the line to the west city limit of Paxico at Newbury Avenue. The Kansas State Highway Commission authorized K-10, which at the time extended west of Lawrence, to be relocated to a new two-lane road between K-99 north of Alma and Maple Hill through an October 29, 1940, resolution. This new highway bypassed K-10's old course west from Paxico when it was completed between 1941 and 1945. The commission accepted K-138 into the state highway system from Wabaunsee County through an October 8, 1952, resolution. K-138 followed K-10's old course for 1.259 miles (2.026 km) between an oblique intersection on a tangent with the contemporary course of K-10 and the city limit of Paxico. K-10 near Paxico was replaced by US-40 between 1953 and 1956.

K-157 is a 3.866-mile-long (6.222 km) spur route in Lyon Township in southwestern Geary County that serves Rock Springs 4-H Center, a 4-H camp that lies in both Geary and Dickinson counties. The highway begins at the main entrance of Rock Springs 4-H Center just north of the Geary–Dickinson county line. K-157 heads north to the next section line road, then the route curves east and follows the section line road to its eastern terminus at US-77 between Junction City and Herington. The Kansas State Highway Commission proposed a state highway connection between US-77 and Rock Springs 4-H Camp in a May 24, 1950, resolution, and the commission confirmed their decision in a November 14, 1950, resolution. The highway used the north–south segment of modern K-157, but instead of heading east toward modern US-77 north of the camp, the highway headed west to the contemporary course of US-77. The Kansas State Highway Commission approved a relocation of US-77 between Herington and Junction City in a January 6, 1960, resolution. The resolution included designation of a new course for K-157 from north of the 4-H facility to connect with the new course of US-77 and to remove the connection to old US-77. K-157 was assigned to its present course after US-77's relocation was completed in 1961.

K-238 is a 1.433-mile-long (2.306 km) spur route in Elwood in east central Doniphan County. The highway serves Rosecrans Memorial Airport, the joint civilian–military airport for St. Joseph, Missouri, which lies on the opposite side of the Missouri River from Elwood. The airport lies west of the river but is in the state of Missouri; the Kansas–Missouri border follows a chain of oxbow lakes. Traffic from St. Joseph must pass through Kansas and use K-238 to reach the city's airport. K-238 begins at a diamond interchange with US-36 in the city of Elwood between St. Joseph and Wathena. The highway heads north through an S-curve and intersects Roseport Road. K-238 continues north along the west city limit to its end at the Browning Bridge, which crosses the eponymous oxbow lake into Missouri at the south end of the airport. The Missouri River and the state line followed the same meander path prior to the Missouri River basin floods of 1952, before which St. Joseph was connected to its airport on land via Missouri Supplemental Route OO. The 1952 floods created a meander cutoff east of the airport, cutting St. Joseph off from its airport. By 1955, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a permanent cutoff channel east of the one caused by the floods. In order to improve access to the airport, the Kansas State Highway Commission approved the designation and construction of K-238 from US-36, which then followed Roseport Road, north to the Browning Bridge at the state line in a July 12, 1961, resolution. The highway was constructed and marked as K-238 in 1962. US-36 was authorized to be moved to its present freeway in a July 31, 1980, resolution. The resolution also extended K-238 east from its southern terminus along old US-36 through Elwood to its partial cloverleaf interchange with the freeway just west of the U.S. Highway's bridge to St. Joseph. K-238 was authorized to be placed on its present course and removed from Roseport Road through a March 25, 1993, resolution. The diamond interchange at K-238's southern terminus was completed between 1995 and 1997.

The Kansas State Highway Commission authorized the construction of I-70, the relocation of US-40 onto I-70, and the removal of old US-40 from the state highway system from Hays to east of Russell in an May 13, 1964, resolution. That resolution included a connector between I-70 and Gorham to retain state access to the city that would be removed with the removal of the old route of US-40 from the state highway system. K-257 was assigned to the Gorham connector after I-70 was completed through Russell County in 1966. The Kansas Department of Transportation removed K-257 from the state highway system through an August 24, 2006, resolution.

K-264 is a 1.033-mile-long (1.662 km) spur route that serves Larned State Hospital west of Larned in central Pawnee County. The highway begins at a T-intersection northwest of the psychiatric hospital within the state complex, which also includes the Larned Correctional Mental Health Facility and the Larned Juvenile Correctional Facility of the Kansas Department of Corrections. K-264 heads north out of the state reservation through an S-curve to its north end at K-156 between Larned and Burdett. The Kansas State Highway Commission authorized constructing K-264 through an August 11, 1965, resolution. Because the route served a state institution, the spur highway was exempt from the 10,000-mile (16,093 km) state highway system limitation. K-264 was completed between 1965 and 1968.


== K-265 ==
K-265 was a spur route that was proposed to serve the city of Leonardville in Riley County. The highway was to begin at the Leonardville city limits and run northward to US-24. The Kansas Department of Transportation proposed on March 17, 1965 that US-24 be moved to a new alignment north of Leonardville and that K-265 follow the old US-24 alignment north to the new one. K-265 was never built as US-24 was never rerouted.


== K-266 ==
K-266 is a 7.541-mile-long (12.136 km) state highway located entirely within Republic County in the U.S. state of Kansas. K-266's southern terminus is at US-36 west of the City of Scandia, and the northern terminus is at Pawnee Indian Museum State Historic Site.

== K-267 ==
K-267 is a 0.837-mile-long (1.347 km) spur route that serves the city of Kanorado in west central Sherman County near the Colorado state line. The highway begins at a diamond interchange with I-70 and US-24, which run concurrently east–west, between Goodland and Burlington, Colorado. K-267 heads north to Old U.S. Highway 24, onto which the highway turns west to parallel the Kyle Railroad line. The highway ends at Eastern Avenue at the east city limit of Kanorado, from which Old U.S. Highway 24 continues west through a corner of Kanorado to the Colorado state line. The Kansas State Highway Commission approved plans for the portion of I-70 between the Colorado state line and Levant in Thomas County through a June 7, 1966, resolution. As part of these plans, US-24 would have been moved onto I-70 and almost all of the old course of US-24 would be removed from the state highway system. However, the portion of old US-24 from Eastern Avenue to the next section line road joined the portion of that road between old US-24 and I-70 as part of the new K-267. K-267 was marked when I-70 was completed from Goodland to the Colorado state line in late 1969.

== K-279 ==
K-279 is a 0.489-mile-long (0.787 km) spur route that serves Osawatomie State Hospital in the city of Osawatomie in southwestern Miami County. The highway begins at Osawatomie Road at the eastern entrance to the psychiatric hospital grounds. K-279 heads east, passing out of and back into the Osawatomie city limits, to a diamond interchange with US-169 and K-7, which run concurrently along the freeway bypass of Osawatomie, between Paola and Garnett. K-279 was established as the route number for a new connector between the US-169 bypass and Osawatomie State Hospital in the same July 19, 1972, resolution in which the Kansas State Highway Commission approved constructing the bypass. The highway was constructed to retain state highway access to the state hospital after US-169 was removed from Old Kansas City Road. Because the route served a state institution, K-279 was exempt from the 10,000-mile (16,093 km) state highway system limitation. The US-169 bypass, K-279, and their interchange opened between 1975 and 1977.


== K-284 ==

K-284 is a 5.618-mile-long (9.041 km) spur route that serves the city of Barnard in north central Lincoln County.


== K-285 ==
K-285 was a 0.218-mile-long (0.351 km) spur route that served the city of De Soto in northwestern Johnson County. The highway began at a partial cloverleaf interchange with K-10 between Shawnee and Eudora. K-285 headed north to the south city limit of De Soto, from which the highway continued north along Lexington Avenue. The Kansas State Highway Commission authorized the relocation of K-10 onto its freeway between De Soto and K-7 and the removal of old K-10 from the state highway system in a June 15, 1972, resolution. The 0.607-mile-long (0.977 km) portion of old K-10 from the freeway to the south city limit of De Soto would be retained and designated K-285. K-285 replaced the piece of K-10 north of the freeway when the K-10 freeway was completed between 1975 and 1977. In 1977, the city of De Soto expanded its limits southward; thus, the Kansas Department of Transportation removed the 0.389-mile-long (0.626 km) portion of K-285 between the old and new south city limit from the state highway system in a January 26, 1977, resolution. The resolution also stated any further annexation of the land under K-285 would automatically result in the relevant length of road being transferred to local control. The city of De Soto activated this provision of the resolution, thus removing K-285 from the state highway system, when the city annexed the remainder of the land under K-285 between 1997 and 1999.


== K-368 ==
K-368 is a 1.000-mile-long (1.609 km) spur route that serves Pomona State Park near Vassar in east central Osage County. The highway begins at K-268 between Lyndon and Quenemo. K-368 heads north and intersects the Flint Hills Nature Trail, a rail trail along a former Missouri Pacific Railroad line, before reaching its north end at the entrance to Pomona State Park. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began to construct Pomona Dam and its associated reservoir in the early 1960s. The federal agency agreed to relocate several county highways that would be displaced by the reservoir, and the Kansas State Highway Commission requested a pair of those highways–an east–west highway between US-75 and K-68 and an access road to the recreational land around the reservoir—be constructed to state highway standards. The commission designated those highways K-268 and K-368, respectively, in a November 14, 1962, resolution. K-268 and K-368 were constructed and added to the state highway system and Pomona Reservoir was completed between 1963 and 1965.

Title: L&YR Class 30
Aspects: {'L&YR Class 30 (disambiguation)'}

The L&YR Class 30 was a class of 0-8-0 steam locomotives of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. The class was designed by John Aspinall and introduced in 1900.

Twenty of the class, built in 1903, were fitted with Henry Hoy's corrugated cylindrical steel firebox. This was not a great success (the internal flue deformed under steam pressure and water circulation was poor) and they were later rebuilt with conventional boilers.


== Numbering ==
A total of 60 locomotives was built and these passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923. The LMS numbered them 12700-12759 and gave them the power classification 5F. In 1948, British Railways (BR) inherited only 1 surviving locomotive. This was LMS 12727 (L&YR 1433 ) and BR numbered it 52727.


== Withdrawal ==
The first locomotive was withdrawn in 1926 and the last in 1950. None were preserved.

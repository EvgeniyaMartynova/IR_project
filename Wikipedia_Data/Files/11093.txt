Title: List of bus routes in Queens
Aspects: {'Q47'}

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) operates a number of bus routes in Queens, New York, United States, under two different public brands.  Some of them are the direct descendants of streetcar lines (see list of streetcar lines in Queens).

=== Dollar vans ===

When the MTA discontinued some routes on June 27, 2010, operators of commuter vans, also known as dollar vans, were allowed to take over certain discontinued routes. In Queens, these routes were the Q74 and Q79. There are also dollar vans that operate from Jamaica Center, providing an alternative mode of transportation to bus routes such as the Q4 to Cambria Heights, the Q113 to Far Rockaway, and the Q5 and Q85 to Green Acres Mall. The vans, some licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission and some unlicensed, charge a fare of $2.00, lower than the $2.75 fare for MTA-operated local buses, but without free transfers.In December 2011, City Councilman Leroy Comrie pushed the city to create designated bus stops for the dollar van services to alleviate traffic and interference of dollar vans with MTA buses. These dollar van stops for drop off and pick ups now includes the corner of 153rd Street and Archer Avenue along with Parsons Boulevard between Archer and Jamaica Avenue.

== Former routes ==
Below are the list of former Queens bus routes, including the previous route designations of current routes. Several route numbers for NYCTA buses in Queens and other boroughs were changed on July 1, 1974. On December 11, 1988, when the Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer subway station opened, some of the Brooklyn "B" routes that operate primarily in Queens were redesignated as "Q" routes, and a number of other routes were renumbered or modified. Most of the former routes are operated by NYCTA; some were operated by private companies in Queens.

Title: Cyathea glauca
Aspects: {'C. glauca'}

Cyathea glauca is a species of tree fern endemic to Réunion. Little is known about this species.
C. glauca is not to be confused with Cyathea glauca (Fourn., 1872) used as a synonym of Cyathea mexicana.


== Habitat and related species ==
C. glauca grows at higher altitudes (1300-2000m) and it is one of three species of tree fern that are indigenous to Réunion island. 

Cyathea excelsa, which also occurs in Mauritius, grows at slightly lower altitudes (200-1700m). Like C. glauca, its leaves are tripinnate, but the new fronds of Cyathea excelsa are hairless; those of C. glauca have red-brown hairs.
Cyathea borbonica var. borbonica is the only species with bipinnate fronds.

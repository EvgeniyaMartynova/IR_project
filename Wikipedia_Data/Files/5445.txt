Title: Forgotten Rebels
Aspects: {'I Am King (disambiguation)'}

The Forgotten Rebels are a punk rock band from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.  Founded in 1977, the Forgotten Rebels have a discography of seven albums and a collection of EPs and singles.


== History ==
In 1979, Chris Houston (a.k.a. Pogo Agogo) joined the band and played bass on the 1980 release In Love With the System.  Houston left the band just over a year later citing "creative differences" and time constraints as he pursued post secondary education.

"It’s time that we be nice to each other. And if somebody’s acting out of line, he gets his ass kicked. Racism is stupid," lead singer and founder Mickey DeSadist has stated.  "People should listen to our music for what it is. I was making fun of rednecks in "Bomb the Boats". More than anything, I was just making fun of that. But I guess it came across the wrong way."

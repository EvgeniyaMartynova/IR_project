At an elevation of 3,115 ft (949 m) above sea level, the airport is Australia's third-highest airport, behind Mount Hotham Airport and Armidale Airport. It has two runways: 11/29 with an asphalt surface measuring 2,213 m × 30 m (7,260 ft × 98 ft) and 04/22 with a grassed red clay surface measuring 783 m × 30 m (2,569 ft × 98 ft).


== Terminal upgrade and airport extension ==
As part of a larger upgrade to the airport, the old terminal building was closed on 21 September 2013 and demolished in the following weeks. Construction of the new terminal was estimated to cost A$3.3 million. A two-year project to extend the airport's main runway by 538 metres (1,765 feet) commenced around the same time, and was completed in 2015.In August 2014, the airport's new terminal opened, which featured dedicated departures and arrivals areas; room for facilities for three airlines; a cafe and a conveyor belt system. The terminal has no security screening, meaning that despite the improvements to the airport's runways, aircraft with over 50 seats remain unable to offer services from the airport.

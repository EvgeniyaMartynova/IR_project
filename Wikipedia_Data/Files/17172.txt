== History ==
An early Christian (3rd–5th c.) basilica was discovered along with other Roman findings in the Šiprage area at the Crkvenica-Vrbanja river mouth. 12th-century stećci testify medieval settlement. The original location of stećci was the Crkvenica-Vrbanja, from where they were removed and built into walls of the surrounding buildings (possibly due to the beliefs of their miraculous properties). One of the best preserved stećak is submerged in Vrbanja.
It has been theorized that Kotor Varoš was mentioned in the De Administrando Imperio as "Katera" (Greek: Κατερα), a part of the "land of Bosnia".The town was part of the Donji Kraji province of the Banate of Bosnia in the 13th century. In the 14th century, the town was the property of the Hrvatinić noble family.
Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina began in 1878 and ended with the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, later renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The town was part of the Vrbas Banovina (1929–41), while after World War II it became part of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a republic of Yugoslavia.
During the Bosnian War (1992–95), some religious and cultural monuments and landmarks were destroyed by Serb paramilitary groups, such as a Catholic church in the centre of the town, as well as all of the mosques. In the southern Čaršija (bazaar) quarter of the town nearly all houses were destroyed. Bosnian Serb-dominated parts of the town were largely unaffected. Bosnian Serb police and military forces devastated surrounding villages too, especially those upstream along the Vrbanja to Kruševo Brdo, as well as all non-Serb villages downstream to Banja Luka. All settlements in the Vrbanja valley were sacked and much of the Bosniak and Croat population left the municipality.

Title: Nokia N86 8MP
Aspects: {'N86'}

The Nokia N86 8MP is a high-end smartphone announced on 17 February 2009 and released in May 2009. It runs on Symbian OS 9.3 (S60 3rd Edition FP2) and is part of the Nseries. It shares similar design features with the N97.
One of its main selling points is its Carl Zeiss photography features. It was Nokia's first camera phone to have an 8 megapixel sensor (although late compared to other manufacturers), and features both multiple aperture settings and a mechanical shutter (uncommon features by the standards of camera phones), and a Carl Zeiss lens with a wide angle of view (28 mm equivalent). It also has auto focus and a dual LED flash (3rd generation dual-LEDs), and an AF assist light. Video capture resolution is 640 Ã— 480 pixels (VGA) at 30 frames per second.The N86 continuous the form factor of the Nokia N95 and N85 with its dual-sliding form factor, whilst adding a toughened glass front cover and metal detailing and keypad, making it look and feel premium. It has a 2.6-inch AMOLED display, a fast 434 MHz processor, and an 8 GB internal memory. It also has the same kickback stand as the N85 so it is possible to use as a small standalone screen, and it is possible to configure the opening of the stand to launch applications such as the video player. It also supports the N-Gage gaming platform. The N86 8MP is regarded as the spiritual successor of the N95 8GB due to its feature set in the same sliding form factor, and the commercial failure of the N96. Some regard it a successor of the N82 due to its camera.

The Nokia N87, a successor of the N86, was leaked on the internet with full specifications in December 2009 and then again in early 2010. However it was never released, and instead the touchscreen Nokia N8 was introduced. In November 2010 a prototype of the N87 appeared on eBay which shows it running probably Symbian^3. The listing was removed after some time by the seller. Nokia would never release another high-end non-touchscreen device after the N86 8MP.

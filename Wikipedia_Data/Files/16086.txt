Title: Admittance parameters
Aspects: {'Y-matrix'}

Admittance parameters or Y-parameters (the elements of an admittance matrix or Y-matrix) are properties used in many areas of electrical engineering, such as power, electronics, and telecommunications. These parameters are used to describe the electrical behavior of linear electrical networks. They are also used to describe the small-signal (linearized) response of non-linear networks. Y parameters are also known as short circuited admittance parameters. They are members of a family of similar parameters used in electronic engineering, other examples being: S-parameters, Z-parameters, H-parameters, T-parameters or ABCD-parameters.


== The Y-parameter matrix ==
A Y-parameter matrix describes the behaviour of any linear electrical network that can be regarded as a black box with a number of ports. A port in this context is a pair of electrical terminals carrying equal and opposite currents into and out of the network, and having a particular voltage between them. The Y-matrix gives no information about the behaviour of the network when the currents at any port are not balanced in this way (should this be possible), nor does it give any information about the voltage between terminals not belonging to the same port. Typically, it is intended that each external connection to the network is between the terminals of just one port, so that these limitations are appropriate.
For a generic multi-port network definition, it is assumed that each of the ports is allocated an integer n ranging from 1 to N, where N is the total number of ports. For port n, the associated Y-parameter definition is in terms of the port voltage and port current, 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            n
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{n}\,}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          I
          
            n
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle I_{n}\,}
   respectively.
For all ports the currents may be defined in terms of the Y-parameter matrix and the voltages by the following matrix equation:

  
    
      
        I
        =
        Y
        V
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle I=YV\,}
  where Y is an N × N matrix the elements of which can be indexed using conventional matrix notation. In general the elements of the Y-parameter matrix are complex numbers and functions of frequency. For a one-port network, the Y-matrix reduces to a single element, being the ordinary admittance measured between the two terminals.


== Two-port networks ==

The Y-parameter matrix for the two-port network is probably the most common. In this case the relationship between the port voltages, port currents and the Y-parameter matrix is given by:

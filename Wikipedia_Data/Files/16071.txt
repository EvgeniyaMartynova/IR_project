Title: Y Garn (Glyderau)
Aspects: {'Y Garn'}

Y Garn is a mountain in Snowdonia, North Wales, part of the Glyderau.
It is one of the Welsh 3000s â€” the 15 summits in Wales over 3,000 ft in height. It is the tenth highest peak in Wales.  Moderate snow accumulations can take place on the western sloping side of the mountain from October to May.
The south-westerly side of the mountain slopes gently down to the Nant Peris valley. The other, north-easterly side is of a different character, consisting of two steeply sided cwms, Cwm Clyd and Cwm Cywion, and finally Llyn Idwal and Ogwen Cottage. Along the ridge to the north lies Elidir Fawr, while to the south-east is the top of the Twll Du and Glyder Fawr.

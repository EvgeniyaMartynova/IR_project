Title: Wabash Township, Gibson County, Indiana
Aspects: {'Wabash Township, Indiana'}

Wabash Township is one of ten townships in Gibson County, Indiana, United States. As of the 2010 census, its population was 30 and it contained 27 housing units. Wabash Township has no organized seat within the township, as the only settlement is in two river camps Crawleyville and Jimtown. The township seat is Owensville, in Montgomery Township. This area is occasionally referred to as the "Tail of Gibson County", owing to its shape and position within the county. Nevertheless, the township is a panhandle of Gibson County, bordered by the Wabash River to the north, northwest, west, and in some parts, east, even southeast, and by Posey County to the south.
Wabash Township was established in 1838, and named from the Wabash River.

== Life ==
Jones joined the Indian Army and after serving as a private soldier in a Volunteer Artillery Battery was commissioned into the Indian Army Reserve of Officers on the 22 September 1915 and served in Mesopotamia during the First World War, being taken prisoner in April 1916. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 22 September 1916.After the war, he became Financial Commissioner and retired in 1922, settling in Bangor, North Wales.


== Prison life and escape ==
Between February 1917 and October 1918, Jones and Hill convinced their Turkish captors that they were mediums adept at the Ouija board. The pair spent over a year conning the camp's commandant. Eventually they persuaded their Turkish captors they were insane and, after being moved to a hospital for the mentally ill in the summer of 1918, the two men played their roles as lunatics so successfully they also fooled the doctors and were returned home. Ironically, they arrived home only a few months before their brother officers were released from Yozgad.

A film adaptation of The Road to En-dor was in development in 2008, written by Neil Gaiman and Penn Jillette, and produced by E. H. Jones's granddaughter Hilary Bevan Jones.

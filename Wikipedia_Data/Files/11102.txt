Title: Infiniti Q60
Aspects: {'Q60'}

The Infiniti Q60 is a 2 door sport luxury coupe and convertible manufactured by Japanese automaker Infiniti. It is the successor to the Infiniti G coupe and convertible. The first generation Q60 was a rebadged Infiniti G coupe. This change came about after Infiniti former president Johan de Nysschen cited the need for "a new identity and direction to promote consumer familiarity with our model range as we expand the portfolio." Beginning in 2014, all passenger cars would be "Q" followed by a two-digit number. Those numbers would correspond to the vehicle’s position in the Infiniti hierarchy.
The second generation concept Q60 was unveiled at the 2015 North American International Auto Show. The production-ready model was released at the 2016 North American International Auto Show as a 2017 model.

Following the redesign, the new Q60 is able to have a drag coefficient of just 0.28, and zero front and rear lift. This allows the vehicle to remain stable at high speeds and in crosswind conditions.

=== Project Black S ===

Project Black S is a concept Q60 developed with Renault Sport Formula One Team. It was unveiled at the 2017 Geneva International Motor Show. It features a Formula One inspired energy regeneration system with a dual motor/generator unit and battery pack. Engine power specifications were not disclosed, however, it is expected to come with the Red Sport 400 engine. The first motor traction motor/generator mounts is attached end of transmission, providing direct power to the rear wheels. The second motor/generator is attached to the turbocharger, to help spool it up instantly to eliminate turbo lag at lower engine speeds. Once at higher revs, when the exhaust is flowing through the turbine and no longer has lag, it acts as a generator by siphoning off a bit of electricity and sending it to the battery. It is estimated to have an output of 500hp with the V6 engine and two electric motors. It will also feature braking-by-wire, but will ditch the Red Sport’s controversial steering-by-wire system in favour of a motor-driven unit.The vehicle also features a center-mounted titanium twin exhaust system and lightweight 21-inch forged wheels all mounted on 245/35R21 Pirelli P Zero. It also features a new racing inspired vents up front framing the front bumper, and a rear diffuser and wing, aimed to significantly increase rear downforce of the car.In an interview conducted by Car Advice, Infiniti’s director of product strategy and motorsport, Tommaso Volpe, revealed that the countdown to the prototype's unveiling was on. He mentioned that several key suppliers were just weeks away from delivering important components like electric motors, as well as other key parts for the twin turbo V6 engine. An updated version of Project Black S will be unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show. It features new yellow accents on the front bumper, tires and spoiler, new wheels and a revised hood. Infiniti is expected to release more details about the engine at the Paris Motor Show as well.

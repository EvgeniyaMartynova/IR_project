== Career ==
J'son grew up in South Central Los Angeles singing on the street corner for tips after school. He started singing at the age of eight in an attempt to gain his mother’s attention, which is when his singing abilities were recognized. At the age of 13 J'son met Minetta D. Gammage who then introduced him to her business partner David Esterson, who helped get a record deal with Hollywood Records.
In 1995 J'son released his first single "Take A Look". The song peaked at #74 on the Billboard Hot 100, #26 on Billboard's Rhythmic Top 40 chart, #38 on Billboard's Hot Dance Music\Club Play chart and #54 on Billboard's Hot R&B Singles chart. His second single "I'll Never Stop Loving You" peaked at #62 on the Billboard Hot 100, #38 on Billboard's Rhythmic Top 40 chart, and #57 on Billboard's Hot R&B Singles chart. The song appeared on the "First Kid" movie soundtrack and it was covered by Britney Spears, appearing as the B-side to her single "(You Drive Me) Crazy". J'son's self-titled debut album was released on February 27, 1996 and peaked at #44 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart. His song "Say That You're Ready" appeared on the Eddie movie soundtrack in 1996. A song titled "Down and Dirty was featured The 6th Man movie soundtrack in 1997.
In 1998, he released the single "I Should Cheat On You", the lead single from his sophomore album. The song peaked at #48 on Billboard's Hot R&B Singles chart, #72 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed on the chart for 13 weeks. Unfortunately due to the lackluster sells of the single, his second album was shelved. After leaving Hollywood records he joined the R&B boy band 3rd Storee (also known as Chapter 4) and released one album with them in 2002. Aside from music, J'son has done some acting, commercials, voice-overs and he appears in the movie “Honey” starring Jessica Alba.

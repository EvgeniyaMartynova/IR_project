Aspects: {'KABE'}

KABE-CD, virtual channel 39 (UHF digital channel 35), is a low-powered, Class A Univision owned-and-operated television station licensed to Bakersfield, California, United States. Owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications, it is sister to Class A UniMás owned-and-operated station KBTF-CD (channel 31) and Justice Network affiliate KUVI-DT (channel 45). The three stations share studios on Truxtun Avenue in the western section of Bakersfield; KABE-CD's transmitter is located atop Mount Adelaide.
In addition to its own digital signal, KABE-CD is simulcast in high definition on the second digital subchannel of KUVI (virtual and UHF channel 45.2) from a separate transmitter atop Mount Adelaide.


== History ==
K52DJ launched in 1989 as a translator of Fresno's Univision station KFTV. It was renamed KSUV-LP and moved to channel 39 in 1998 after Univision purchased UPN affiliate KUZZ-TV (now KUVI-DT) from Buck Owens. It was renamed to KBTF-LP in 2002 during the launch of TeleFutura (now UniMás). It was renamed to KABE-LP in 2004 after a callsign swap with the original KABE-CA (channel 31, now KBTF-CD). In 2013, the station obtained Class A status. In 2019, KABE started airing Court TV on its second digital subchannel as part of an agreement between Scripps and Univision for areas where KERO-TV's signal is not easily received.

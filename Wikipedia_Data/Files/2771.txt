Title: E with diaeresis (Cyrillic)
Aspects: {'E with diaeresis'}

E with diaeresis (Ӭ ӭ; italics: Ӭ ӭ) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. Its form is derived from the Cyrillic letter E (Э э Э э).
E with diaeresis is used in the alphabet of the Kildin Sami language, where it represents the close-mid front unrounded vowel /e/, following a palatalized (sometimes called "half-palatalized") stop, /nʲ, tʲ, dʲ/. In Moksha, it was used for the near-open front unrounded vowel /æ/, however, in contemporary Moksha it's been replaced by Я or word-initially by Э.

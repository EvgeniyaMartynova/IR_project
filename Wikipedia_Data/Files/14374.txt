ATC code V10 Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is a therapeutic subgroup of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, a system of alphanumeric codes developed by the WHO for the classification of drugs and other medical products. Subgroup V10 is part of the anatomical group V Various.
Codes for veterinary use (ATCvet codes) can be created by placing the letter Q in front of the human ATC code: for example, QV10. National issues of the ATC classification may include additional codes not present in this list, which follows the WHO version.

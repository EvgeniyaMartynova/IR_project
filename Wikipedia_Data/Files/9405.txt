Title: Compaq Evo
Aspects: {'N1000'}

The Compaq Evo was a series of business desktop and laptop PCs and thin clients made by Compaq and Hewlett-Packard (following the 2002 merger). The Evo brand was introduced by Compaq in May 2001 as a business-oriented brand, and replaced Compaq's Deskpro brand for its desktops and Armada for its notebooks.Evo was rebranded as HP Compaq, which was used until 2013.


== Design ==
The Desktops were small and made to be positioned horizontally instead of vertically, so the monitor could be placed on top to save space. Most featured a sleek silver and black compact design. The early models shipped with CD-ROM drives, but Compaq eventually shipped Evos with CD-RW drives and DVD-ROM drives. The design of some models only allowed for one CD or DVD drive, but some models had bigger designs for 2 CD or DVD drives. Some of the models also shipped with a 3Â½ floppy drive, positioned below the CD or DVD drive. Most models also had 2 USB 2.0 ports in the front for convenience, as well as having two in the back for human interface devices and external volumes. Most also had a headphone and microphone jack in the front, with line in and line out in the back.
The laptops were a conservative design, described by one reviewer as "the old-school black, squared-off-corner business notebook". Most models had a tough black case reminiscent of IBM's ThinkPad, a midsize 14" or 15" screen, and good multimedia capability. It offered 256 MB RAM as standard but that amount can be easily upgraded to 512 MB or even 1 GB.
The thin clients were based on the Geode processor family.


== Distribution ==
The Compaq Evo Desktop computer was a great option for businesses and schools because of its compact, cheap design. It was affordable and had the needed specs for businesses and schools.
All Compaq Evo computers were shipped standard with Windows XP or Windows 2000 running on them. Most Compaq Evos shipped with Pentium 4 processors, but some Laptop Evos shipped with Centrino platforms.
The last Evo-branded models were released in 2003, later replaced by re-branded (like other Compaq-branded products) as HP Compaq products. The final model to carry the Compaq Evo name was the N620c notebook, an early Pentium-M system which featured up to a 1.6Ghz processor. The N620c was not Intel Centrino-based, but instead used a Compaq wireless module that snapped onto the Multiport slot on the lid of the notebook.

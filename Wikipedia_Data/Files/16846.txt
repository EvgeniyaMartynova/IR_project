Aero Zambia was an airline based in Zambia.Aero Zambia replaced the bankrupt Zambia Airways and was admitted as a full member of IATA on 11 April 1996. The airline employed 300 staff and flew from Lusaka to destinations such as Johannesburg, Ndola, Nairobi, Harare and Dar es Salaam. They offered Business and Economy Classes. Aero Zambia operated two Boeing 737-200s, 9J-AFU and 9J-AFW which was a Combi version.On 19 January 2000 the Zambian Government closed them down due to concerns with safety. The real reason was probably more to do with politics between David Tokoph and Zambian Government officials.

I Love New York is a reality television series featuring Tiffany "New York" Pollard on a quest to find her true love.  The series first aired on VH1 as a spin off to Flavor of Love, another relationship competition series, which featured Pollard as a finalist in two consecutive seasons.

In addition to Pollard, a host of other individuals from Flavor of Love, including "Sister" Patterson (Pollard's mother), appeared on the show to help Pollard choose the right man. Mauricio Sanchez played New York's assistant, "Chamo," during the first season.
The production of a second season of I Love New York was first announced during a commercial break for the April 29, 2007, episode of Flavor of Love Girls: Charm School.

Title: Isuzu D-Max
Aspects: {'T series'}

The Isuzu D-Max is a pickup truck manufactured since 2002 by Isuzu Motors. It shares the same platform with several General Motors (GM) mid-size trucks in the United States such as the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon and Isuzu i-Series. The Chevrolet Colorado name is also applied to a rebadged version of the D-Max in the Middle East and Thailand, although not identical to the American version. The original D-Max is sold alongside the Chevrolet Colorado in the Thai market where they are both built. In Australasia between 2003 and 2008, the D-Max was marketed as the Holden Rodeo, but has since been relaunched as the Holden Colorado. The Isuzu D-Max itself was also introduced in Australia during 2008, selling alongside the Holden-badged offering.

==== Thailand ====

In 2002, the D-Max was prepared for a world premiere in Thailand. This location was chosen because GM-Isuzu had recently decided to close their small truck assembly plant in Japan and move their joint operation to Thailand. The D-Max is available in various models. The Spark (single cab) (EX) is available only as a 4x2, with three configurations between cab chassis, long bed with power steering and without. SpaceCabs (extended cab), and Cab4s (double cab) can be divided into two major configurations: standard height 4x2s (SL, SX, SLX), and 4x4s (S and LS) with the "Rodeo" name instead of SpaceCab. Crew cabs are all sold with the same Cab4 name (Cab4 models became available late in last quarter). All are built and sold alongside the almost identical Chevrolet Colorado which had debuted in the late first quarter of 2004.
Engine choices for that year till the end of third quarter of 2004 derived from its direct predecessor: 4JH1-T 3.0 and 4JA1-T 2.5.
Hi-Lander 3.0 (lifted 4x2), the trim style became available in late 2003, and ground clearance equals that of the 4x4 models. There are only two cab styles to choose between. This makes Isuzu the third manufacturer in Thailand to begin selling lifted 4x2 pickups (after Toyota and Ford).
In October 2004, Isuzu introduced the DDi iTEQ common-rail diesel engine family for the D-Max. The first engine to appear was the 3.0 4JJ1-TC 146 PS (107 kW; 144 hp), however, since then, a design change in the front end of the car has forced engine alterations. Additionally, new MUA-5H five-speed manual transmission also introduced.

During the first quarter of 2005, a 2.5 4JK1-TC 116 PS (85 kW; 114 hp), the second DDi iTEQ engine, was introduced and offered as an economical choice to replace its aging predecessor (4JA1-T was concurrently available for that year only). A mid-cycle refresh brought many models fitted with a new front bumper that incorporated an "instant spoiler" underneath, 4x4 models and Hi-Lander's suspensions were raised up 25 millimeters extra.
In the third quarter of 2006, the D-Max received a minor redesign and the introduction of a third DDi iTEQ engine, 3.0 4JJ1-TCX. This engine is a modified 4JJ1-TC, incorporating a new Variable Valve Geometry Turbo (VGS). The extra power warranted an introduction of new transmissions as well: the MUX 5-Speed manual and MaxMatic-III automatic transmission. All models equipped with Xenon headlamps were changed to projector headlamps instead. Also introduced was the new "Hexapod-plot" interior. Other DDi iTEQ engines were also tweaked a bit for extra power and efficiency.
In 2007, Isuzu celebrated its 50th anniversary in Thailand with "Gold Series" models sold for the 2008 model year. The Hi-Lander Cab4 model with the VGS turbodiesel engine became available for the first time. The 4x4 models get a new front bumper design with chrome accents. Also added was the choice of a 2.5l 4-cylinder engine in LS 4x4 and Hi-Lander models.
During the middle of the first quarter of 2008, the Rodeo LS and Hi-Lander SpaceCab were also fitted with the 3.0-liter VVGS Turbodiesel engine to fill all the remaining gaps in the lineup.
In the early fourth quarter of 2008, Isuzu introduced D-Max Platinum models for 2009 to replace the outgoing Gold Series. LS 4x4 and Hi-Lander received new fascia; chrome on LS 4x4 and semi platinum-silver on Hi-Lander. Minor-modified headlamps and new fog lamps for a platinum look.  4x2 SLX and SX derived fascias from 4x4/Hi-Lander (before Platinum's fascia). Chrome fascia for 3.0 SLX models and color-keyed fascia for SX. Top heads of 3 DDi iTEQ engines changed from gold to platinum. Some models dropped 4JJ1-TC 3.0l engine. All retooled to be acceptable with Biodiesel B5. All SpaceCab models featured new middle pillars called Safety Pillar Cab; pillars and door beam larger and thicker. Not all Cab4 models received retooled rear suspension called Super Flex Plus suspension. Spark EX also received new gauge and indicator. D-Max Platinum models commenced on sale from 15 October.
In the middle of September 2009, Isuzu introduced the D-Max Super Platinum models. SL model was dropped. Highline SLX 4x2 models received same fascia and front bumper as Hi-Lander / LS 4x4 style, new 16" wheels and newer styles of alloy wheels for SLX / Hi-Lander / LS 4x4, newer rear bumper, and new "Super Platinum" marque at the tailgate. LS 4x4 models received skid plate attached under the bumper in brighter silver, newer sidestep. Highline Hi-Lander / LS 4x4 models have newer style blind spot rear view mirrors, and new short-plot antenna.
Every year since late 2005 until now, there are several special D-Max & MU-7 models. Available exclusively only for a period during Thailand's 2 largest auto shows and also other special Isuzu occasions. They were all unique yet never the same in each presentation. D-Max Smart models are such one remarkably special model set. Available in several occasions during 2008. This edition modifies SpaceCab 4x2 2.5 by special white pearl exterior color and optional equipment such as immobilizer key.
Ever since Platinum models introduced, D-Max Smart models expanded up to 3 choices: SpaceCab 4x2, Cab4 4x2, and Hi-Lander 2-Door. These 3 models also updated as new Super Platinum models.
In 2009, a sport version of the D-Max named the X-Series was introduced, aimed especially for a target group of young people normally not interested in using pickup trucks. It was marketed as a "Lifestyle Pickup" and equipped with additional skirts and prominent red Isuzu letters at front grille. The wheels remain unchanged from the normal model but came with gunmetal paint finish. Available in two-door SpaceCab and four-door Cab4 body variants with a manual transmission.
In 2010, D-Max and MU-7 Super Titanium models were introduced. It featured a frontal camera, usually found in luxury cars, first time ever in a Thai pickup, and are the last model in this generation.
In late 2010, revised D-Max X-Series was introduced with new skirts and automatic transmission also available.

==== China and Iran ====
In China  Great Wall and Foday produced the models. In Iran it was produced by Bahman and SAIPA.


==== Australia ====

In Australia and New Zealand, the D-Max was sold as the third generation Holden Rodeo (RA) between 2003 and 2008, before being facelifted into the form of the Holden Colorado. This was a result of the GM-Isuzu split resulting in GM losing the right to use the "Rodeo" name. As with Rodeo, Colorado is available as either two- or four-wheel drive and in a range of body styles including single cab, space cab and crew cab. Power is provided by a range of petrol and diesel engines. Of the petrol engines, Holden offers a 2.4-litre four-cylinder as well as the Australian-made 3.6-litre Alloytec engine. The diesel powerplant is a four-cylinder Isuzu 4JJ1 unit displacing 3.0 litres. The main difference between Colorado and the Rodeo is the revised bodywork from the A-pillar forward.
During October 2008, the Isuzu D-Max was launched in Australia, alongside the almost identical Holden Colorado. Officially available in Australia as its own brand under the marketing name Isuzu UTE Australia, separate to the medium-heavy truck manufacturer, Isuzu Australia.In June 2012, the RC series Holden Colorado was replaced by the RG model based on the second-generation D-Max body.


==== New Zealand ====
In June 2010, Isuzu Utes New Zealand became the official distributor for Isuzu D-Max in New Zealand.


==== Europe ====
In the United Kingdom, Isuzu UK is the official distributor for the Isuzu D-Max.


==== South America ====
Julie Beamer, director of GM Chile, announced on 5 March 2008 to workers of the only remaining automobile factory in Chile, that said factory would be closed down on 31 July that year. The only vehicle that was in production at the time was the Chevrolet D-Max. The announcement came shortly after then-president of Venezuela Hugo Chávez reduced the import quota for cars in Venezuela, the main export market for the Chilean-made Chevrolet D-Max, but GM Chile said in its official statement that the reason behind the end of production in Arica was the lack of favorable conditions for vehicle manufacturing in Chile and fierce competition from many other car manufacturers and countries on Chile's car market.


=== Chevrolet Colorado ===

Thai-market Colorado is smaller than the North American model of the same name and almost unrelated. In late January 2006, Chevrolet introduced a G-80 differential lock system as optional for most Colorado trim levels. This feature is not available on the D-Max. Thai-market Colorado received a minor redesign in late 2007.
The late first quarter of 2008, Chevrolet also introduced Colorado 4x2 2.5 with diesel dual fuel system via CNG tank. Switchable between diesel (65) and compressed natural gas (35) as the divided aspect (65:35); moreover also can use diesel purely as well. Biodiesel B5 is also acceptable. Location of the tank is on the bed behind the cab. Available for two cab styles.


=== Isuzu MU-7 ===

The Isuzu MU-7 is an Isuzu D-Max pickup-based wagon with a seven-seat arrangement. The MU-7 was released in Thailand during November 2004. as the "Sport Utility Wagon" and received advertising.
The MU-7 has the same front fascia as the D-Max but has a covered rear end instead of a truck bed. It is only available in some countries of Southeast Asia. In the Philippines, this model is called the Isuzu Alterra.
Since the early launch, the drivetrain choices are 4x2 and 4x4. All come with one engine: the 3.0 4JJ1-TC DDi iTEQ engine.
Special suspension set which exclusively reserved for all MU-7 is called MOVE suspension. Front: Double Wishbone, torsion bar, anti-roll bar, gas-type shock absorber. Rear: SUV-type leaf springs via gas-type shock absorber.
In the late third quarter of 2006, the MU-7 range of models was updated and separated as Primo (4x2) and Activo (4x4). With a new 3.0 4JJ1-TCX DDi iTEQ, new transmissions were implemented as well: MUX five-speed manual and MaxMatic-III automatic transmission. Also new was the interior, incorporating a console with wood decoration and new "best" seat upholstery.
And just as for the Gold Series and D-Max, both MU-7 Primo GS and Activo GS also receive gold Isuzu badges in 3 locations. GS models also come equipped with a new navigation entertainment system incorporating a new reverse assist (with the camera from Kenwood), all optional since early 2008. Primo and Activo received Wide Vision blind-spot rear view mirror. Also added was the additional new low-cost 4x2 model, the S (with DDI ITEQ 3.0-litre (146 PS)), which is priced below the Primo.
MU-7 Platinum models commenced on the market by 1 November 2008. Frontal changed a bit by platinum tone. Revamped fenders and side trims (by lower tone). But emphasized much in inner accessories.

== Second generation (2012–present) ==

In March 2011, Chevrolet revealed the prototype version of all-new Colorado at Bangkok International Motor Show, not related anymore to D-Max, shown as Extended cab with rear access system, and some of the high-tech equipment, In June 2011, Chevrolet revealed crew cab in adventure concept at Buenos Aires, Argentina (this car also shown at Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2011), and in July 2011, a Holden version of crew-cab version concept car got its premiere at Australian International Motor Show, but the interior of this car looked like production models any more than 2 concepts before.
On 9 September 2011, General Motors (Thailand) opened the diesel engine manufacture plant, to make the "Duramax" engine, as the VM Motori rebadge engine (same as old 2-liter diesel Captiva) with 2.5- or 2.8-liter, manual and automatic, 2WD or 4WD.
New 2012 Isuzu D-MAX Pickup Truck is the Chevy Colorado's Asian Twin.
Isuzu has long abandoned the U.S. passenger and truck market but it continues to have strong ties with General Motors, which was once its primary stockholder. In 2011, the Japanese automaker revealed its all-new D-MAX pickup truck, which was designed in cooperation with GM and is a sister model to the 2012 Chevrolet Colorado. Albeit on separate occasions, both pickup truck models were presented in Thailand. On the outside, the new 2012 D-MAX features different front and rear end styling treatments as well as bespoke trim parts, while inside, the changes over Colorado are limited to the color options and the instrument panel. The body-on-frame Isuzu D-MAX launches in Thailand with three turbodiesel engines, including a pair of 2.5-liter units producing 115 hp (86 kW) and 136 hp (101 kW), and a larger 3.0-liter powerplant with 177 hp (132 kW).
As with previous models, the 2012 Isuzu D-Max shares its ladder chassis platform, body construction, mechanical componentry and interior design (dash, centre stack, steering wheel and doors) with the 2013 North American Chevrolet Colorado. From A-pillar on back Isuzu D-Max appears to be a clone of Chevy Colorado but gets its own visual identity due to an aggressive angular front fascia with upswept headlights and a more conventional grille design.D-Max uses Isuzu's own engine and drivetrain. Isuzu's iTEQ engine has been retained but has been updated. 2500 cc engine is now available in two configurations; normal turbo with 87 kW (117 hp) and 280 N⋅m (207 lbf⋅ft) of torque and VGS Turbo with 101 kW (135 hp) and 320 N⋅m (236 lbf⋅ft) of torque. Also available is the four-cylinder 3000 cc 4JJ1-TC iTEQ common-rail diesel engine with VGS Turbo which now produces 132 kW (177 hp) with 380 N⋅m (280 lbf⋅ft) of torque. Engines performance have been upgraded with Variable geometry turbocharger (VGS Turbo) and Isuzu D-Max's engines pass Euro V emission standard. 2012 D-Max still comes with a 5-speed manual but has unveiled new 5-speed "Rev-Tronic" automatic transmission with sport mode (2011 model had 4-speed automatic transmission). 4WD models have been renamed from "Rodeo" to "V-Cross", and transfer case has been renamed from "Touch-on-the-fly" button to new "Terrain command" system that uses the spin system to allow for seamless changing of drive modes from 4-Wheel to 2-Wheel Drive mode. Isuzu front suspension made up of independent double wishbone with coil-spring setup and a rear suspension made up of over slung leaf-springs installed above a special long span rear axle make for a comfortable driving experience. Ecuador is the only country where this generation D-Max is available with a gasoline engine, an Opel-based C24 with 16 valves and double overhead camshafts supplied from Brazil where the lower-grade versions of the Chevrolet S10 still rely on a flex-fuel 8-valve SOHC version which also served as a basis for the Vortec 2400 industrial engine.
Isuzu new ladder-frame chassis platform dubbed "i-GRIP" (Isuzu Gravity Responsive Intelligent Platform) underpinning the new D-Max makes 42% stronger than its predecessors leading to improved ride and handling. The frame includes improved cross bracing at the rear, improving stability under loads and while towing, while also "ensuring long-term durability when used regularly in harsh environments". The longer wheelbase of 3095mm – 45mm longer than before – is now standard on all three body styles.
The D-Max would continue to be offered in all three body styles: Single Cab, Space Cab, and Crew Cab. Customers will also continue to have a choice of rear-wheel drive 4x2 and four-wheel drive 4x4 models. Space Extra Cab has laterally opening door to give easier access to the rear seat. Isuzu D-Max has an advanced safety package, with features including high-tensile steel, electronic stability control ESC, traction control (TCS), ABS, emergency brake assist, a number of airbags and Electronic brakeforce distribution EBD. EBD detects the payload weight and modulates the rear braking force to compensate. In ESC fitted models ABS now goes to 4-channel 4-sensor type instead of the current 3-channel 4-sensor.

Interior design in the D-Max is the same as the corresponding Chevrolet Colorado but uses its own upholstery, Standard 2WD models use beige cloth interior, Hi-Lander Z models come with black cloth interior, and Z-Prestige models come with Brown interior; 2.5-liter models come with cloth, 3-liter models come with leather, the meter is really changing, with added of multi-information display with support of Thai language menu operation, 2DIN CD player with Bluetooth and USB connection support or Kenwood DVD system (Changed Isuzu DVD-iGENIE Navi System in MY2013), Audio switch control, Driver power seat, Rear foldable seat (in Crew Cab models), also with over 10 position of intelligent storage space e.g. under steering wheel, over center console, 10-position cup holders

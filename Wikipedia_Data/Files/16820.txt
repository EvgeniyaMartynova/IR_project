Title: Harbin Z-5
Aspects: {'Z5'}

The Harbin Z-5 (Zhishengji – helicopter) is a Chinese variant of the Soviet Mil Mi-4 piston powered helicopter. Before its discontinuation from service, it was produced in Harbin, China. The USSR provided China with Mi-4 blueprints just a few years before the Sino-Soviet split in 1958. Maiden flight was in 1958 and mass production started in the mid-1960s. China has produced a number of unique variants through this model, and the Z-5 was employed by the PLA, PLAAF and PLANAF in large numbers as reserve forces. A total of 558th Z-5 were built. A few Z-5 helicopters were modified to carry machine-guns and rocket pods.During the Chinese-Western rapprochement, one Z-5 was refitted with a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6T-6 "Twin Pac" turbo-shaft engine in 1979. Some sources refer to this as the Z-6, but this variant discontinued after its first model.

A statue of the saint, St. John of the Indians ((in Portuguese): São João dos Índios) appeared at one of the missions, became a patron saint in the region.In the 18th century, the Xakriabá settled in reservations (aldeias).1927 marked the first major conflict between encroached ranchers and the Xakriabá. Ranchers forced the Xakriabá to build fences for cattle in the tribes' territory. The Xakriabá resisted by setting fire to the fences, and ranchers responded violently.

Aspects: {'M road'}

State Highways in Ukraine are subdivided into three categories: International (M-network), National (H-network), and Regional (P-network). The letter's indexes are of Cyrillic standing for their respective abbreviation in the Ukrainian language.


== List of International Highways in Ukraine ==
International Highways (Ukraine) - are the roads in Ukraine on the route involving international transport corridors and/or highways that are part of the European network. The international highways in Ukraine are identified with letter M for the Ukrainian transliteration (Mizhnarodni), followed by double digit 01 through 29. Usually freeways their major routes detour around highly congested areas such as cities, however these highways also might have some branches with the same identification signs posted while going through such congested areas. Some of these highways, especially around major cities have 8, 10 or more lanes.
There are 29 international highways of Ukraine with their total length reaching 8,652.7 km (5,376.5 mi). Those highways cover 4.9% of all highways in the country. In the following list all lengths are given by the major route. When branches (or exits) are mentioned and added to the length, the total length then measured including the whole network, not as an alternative route. (compare to business route)

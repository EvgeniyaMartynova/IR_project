Title: F-19
Aspects: {'F19'}

F-19 is the designation for a hypothetical US fighter aircraft that has never been officially acknowledged, and has engendered much speculation that it might refer to a type of aircraft whose existence is still classified.


== History ==
Since the unification of the numbering system in 1962, U.S. fighters have been designated by consecutive numbers, beginning with the F-1 Fury. F-13 was never assigned to a fighter due to superstition, though the designation had previously been used for a reconnaissance version of the B-29. After the F/A-18 Hornet, the next announced aircraft was the YF-20 Tigershark. The USAF proposed the F-19 designation for the fighter, but Northrop requested the "F-20" instead. The USAF finally approved the F-20 designation in 1982.  The truth behind this jump in numbers is Northrop pressed the designation "YF-20" as they wanted an even number, in order to stand out from the Soviet odd numbered designations. Despite this, the designations YF-17 and YF-23 were not skipped (although YF-20, YF-17 and YF-23 all were prototypes and didn't enter production phase).The United States received the first Lockheed F-117 stealth fighter in 1982. During the decade many news articles discussed what they called the "F-19". The Testor Corporation produced a F-19 scale model which did not resemble the F-117, which no doubt pleased those working with the real, secret aircraft. The F-117 designation was publicly revealed with the actual aircraft in November 1988.
Another rumor was that F-19 is really the designation of some other super-secret project, one so black that it will not be revealed for many years.One more version was part of a deliberate plot by the Air Force to confuse Soviet intelligence by inducing them into expending so much effort in trying to find out information about a plane that does not exist.


== Notable appearances in media ==
In the 1983 Chevy Chase film Deal of the Century, Gregory Hines' character "Ray Kasternak" piloted an "F-19" in a dogfight against an autonomous drone fighter.
In 1986, the Testor Corporation released a model aircraft kit, calling it the "F-19 Stealth Fighter". The kit is claimed to be the best-selling plastic model kit of all time.
Like the Testor Corporation, Monogram models also released the "F-19A Specter" which was based on the design by Loral Inc.
In his 1986 novel Red Storm Rising, Tom Clancy featured the "F-19A Ghostrider" (nicknamed "Frisbee" by the pilots and crew) as a secret weapon used to combat a Soviet invasion of Germany. This vehicle was considerably more capable than the F-117, being a supersonic fighter rather than a subsonic precision bomber. The F-19A, as described in the book, featured under wing hard points for various ordnance, including air-to-air missiles and BLU-107 Durandal runway-cratering bombs. The aircraft also has circular wings instead of angular ones, hence the nickname.
An F-19 was the alternate mode of the Decepticon character Whisper in Marvel Comics' Transformers comic book series during the Transformers: Generation 1 era.
The Toyline Ring Raiders, produced by Matchbox, made extensive use of the F19 and F19A on multiple occasions. The main hero Victor Vector flew a personal F19 named Victory 1. The antagonistic pilot Cutthroat used a F19A with the designation Bayonet. In the so-called "Wing Packs", in which every main pilot got his own squadron, F19 and F19A fighters were part of many sets.
Jane's Information Group published an incorrect entry on the F-19 in their aviation reference, Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1986–1987. In addition to the fictitious artwork, the 1987–1988 and 1988–89 editions lists the aircraft as the "Lockheed 'RF-19'" and "XST".
In 1988, MicroProse released a video game entitled F-19 Stealth Fighter, the first computer simulation of stealth air combat.  The visual model of the aircraft was clearly based on Testor's F-19 model kit.
In 1988, an F-19 was released in the G.I. Joe toy line, called the "X-19 Phantom".  Included was a pilot codenamed Ghostrider.  The G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toy the "Phantom X-19" was loosely based on the Testor model.
The 1990 videogame James Bond 007: The Stealth Affair featured the "F-19" as the captured stealth fighter stolen during a testflight at NAS Miramar that ends up in a fictional Latin American country called Santa Paragua, where James Bond is sent to retrieve it.
The 1990 videogame Air Diver featured an "F-119D Stealth Fighter" that strongly resembled the Monogram F-19 model.
The F-19 appears briefly in the animated opening for the TV show Beyond 2000.

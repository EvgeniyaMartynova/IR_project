Groovy Girls launched as a "funky" 
alternative to Barbie.

The brand's lifestyle aspects are fashion, friendship and self-expression, and represents a wholesome alternative to dolls such as Bratz, Flavas, My Scene, and Barbies. 
Groovy Girls were initially sold in specialty toy stores such as Zany Brainy, Noodle Kidoodle, and Store of Knowledge. Beginning in early 2005, the dolls were launched in Target stores.As of 2005, more than eight million Groovy Girls dolls were sold since its inception, 
totaling more than $100 million in retail sales. GroovyGirls.com, which launched in the fall of 2004, had approximately 145,000 registered users by early 2005, and more than 1.7 million registered users by July 2007. 
The Groovy Girls RSVP collection was introduced during the 2008 holiday season. RSVP stands for Respect, Self-Expression, Values and Play.

Burger King offered miniaturized plastic as well as plush versions of Groovy Girls in its global Kids Meal program, which ran from February 12, 2007 to March 18, 2007. 
That year, Manhattan Toy also partnered with the Girl Scouts to develop a line extension of dolls called Troop Groovy Girls. 
An online community called Camp Groovy Girls launched in September, soon after the dolls became available in stores. In February 2008, the Toy Industry Association named the Girl Scouts' Troop Groovy Girls the best girl toy of the year during the American International Toy Fair in New York City. Groovy Girls had previously won "Girl Toy of the Year" and "Specialty Toy of the Year" awards at the 2003 Toy Fair.

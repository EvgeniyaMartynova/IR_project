Title: R40 (New York City Subway car)
Aspects: {'R40'}

The R40 was a New York City Subway car model built by the St. Louis Car Company from 1967 to 1968 for the IND/BMT B Division. The cars were unique for their futuristic 10-degree slanted end (designed by the firm Raymond Loewy and Associates), and were nicknamed the R40 Slants or simply Slants. 
The R40A was a continuation of the R40 order that was also built by the St. Louis Car Company from 1968 to 1969. This order contained two "forms" or body types: a slant-ended version identical to the original R40s (also nicknamed the "R40 Slants" or "Slants"), and a "modified" straight-ended version designed by Sundberg-Ferar (nicknamed the R40M).


== Description ==
The R40s were originally numbered 4150–4249 and 4350–4449. In 1970, cars 4350–4449 were renumbered to 4250–4349. The slant-ended R40As were originally numbered 4450–4549, and the straight-ended R40As were originally numbered 4250–4349; these cars were later renumbered to 4350–4449 and 4450–4549, respectively.
The R40s and first 100 of the R40As were designed with a 10-degree slanted end, with the intention of beautifying the subway, and thus, making it more attractive to car users. However, the New York City Transit Authority found great dangers, along with other hazards and flaws, with the slanted end design; with the lack of handholds for riders walking between cars raising concerns of passengers falling onto the tracks. The doors between cars were closed to prevent accidents as a temporary solution. Within months, the cars were retrofitted at a cost of $215,000 with large grab rails with pantograph gates mounted, which effectively destroyed Loewy's design, but allowed passengers to travel safely between cars. In addition to modifying the R40s and slant-ended R40As, the last 100 R40As were built with the non-sloping design that is used on all other subway cars.The R40s and R40As introduced a new rollsign arrangement that showed the service bullet one side and the terminal stations on the other side, with location and design having slight variations. The roll signs were placed on the upper part of the windows. This pattern became standard for all subsequent orders until the R142 and R142A orders in 2000, which introduced LCD and LED signs that became standard for all New Technology Trains.
The R40As were delivered new with the same successful Stone Safety 10 ton air conditioning systems/units found on the last ten R38 cars, and became standard equipment on all future subway cars purchased from this point onward. As a result of the air conditioning, the standee poles were arranged in an alternating pattern rather than the straight-line pattern seen in the R40s, which lacked air conditioning systems/units until their overhauls.
Due to the cosmetic and mechanical similarities shared by the straight-ended R40As and R42s, the two fleets often ran together, since they were, for all practical purposes, the same car type. In fact, one pair of cars consisted of an R40A car mated to an R42 car. This was the result of an accident on the Williamsburg Bridge in 1995, which involved R40As 4460–4461 and R42s 4664–4665. (see "History" section for more details).


== History ==
In December 1965, the TA contracted Raymond Loewy and Associates to design a new subway car "dramatically different in exterior and interior." This design was planned to be used for 400 cars. The more attractive design was intended to get people out of their cars to use mass transit. On September 20, 1966, the TA announced plans to order 400 new subway cars with this design. The cars were to have wider doors and windows, easier-to-read signage, and interiors with light colors. Bids were opened to the public on October 1, 1966. The cost was to be split evenly between the Federal Government and the city. In November 1966, St. Louis Car Company was awarded the contract to construct 400 subway cars with the new design. The new cars cost $46,172,041.The first incomplete pair of R40s (cars 4350–4351) came onto TA property in November 1967 for promoting the Transportation Bond issue on Election Day and was returned to the assembly plant in St. Louis for completion and delivered in January 1968. On March 23, 1968, the R40 fleet entered service on the F.  All 300 slanted R40s were delivered as of January 24, 1969, with the first modified R40As delivered in January 1969.In 1977, pantograph gates, salvaged from retired R1 through R9 cars, were modified and then installed on the front ends of the straight-ended R40A and R42 cars. On the R42 cars, baloney coiled spring type inter car safety barriers were installed on the blind ends of the married pairs (the straight-ended R40As came factory equipped with the baloney coiled spring type inter car safety barriers on their blind ends, and so did not need such installations).
Pairs 4200–4201 and 4420–4421 were scrapped in the 1980s prior to the overhaul of the R40s and R40As due to damage sustained in various accidents during the 1970s.


=== Overhaul and mishaps ===
In 1988–1989, the R40s and R40As were rebuilt by Sumitomo in Elmira Heights, New York. The interior was changed drastically and the MTA paint band was removed on all rebuilt cars. The R40s were retrofitted with air conditioning, and all cars received a new interior design. Distinctive "EXP" (express) and "LOCAL" marker lights on the slant-ended cars were also removed.
Cars 4259, 4260, 4427, and 4428 were all involved in accidents after their overhaul. All cars except for 4259 were scrapped; however, 4259 never returned to service and was ultimately sunken as an artificial reef along with most other R40s and R40As. Cars 4258, 4261, 4426, and 4429, which lost their mates, were mated as pairs.
On June 5, 1995, R42 number 4664 was rear ended by straight-ended R40A number 4461 on the Williamsburg Bridge. The R42 was written off as it had sustained major damage, while the R40A was repaired and rebuilt into a slant-ended car. It was temporarily numbered 4260 as it was intended to be mated to R40 number 4259. Meanwhile, straight-ended R40A number 4460 and R42 number 4665 became paired to each other. This pair today survives as part of the museum fleet.


=== Retirement ===
The R160 subway car order replaced all of the R40s and R40As from 2007 to 2009.
The R40s and slant-ended R40As were retired and reefed from fall 2007 to June 12, 2009, when the last slant-ended train, consisting of R40A pairs 4414–4415, 4424–4425, 4432–4433, 4398–4399, and R40 pair 4256–4257, made its final trip on the A. The straight-ended R40As were retired starting in January 2009 until August 28, 2009, when the last pair, 4484–4485, ran on the V along with four R42 pairs.After retirement, most cars were stripped and sunk as artificial reefs in the Atlantic Ocean. The last R40/R40A cars to be removed from property by barge were R40 4272 and straight-ended R40As 4474–4475, which were reefed on April 17, 2010.  However, R40 pair 4162–4163 and slant-ended R40A pairs 4392–4393 and 4442–4443 were retained as school cars until 2013. These cars were eventually decommissioned and trucked to Sims Metal Management in Newark, New Jersey from April 2013 to October 1, 2013 for scrapping, as the reefing program had ended in April 2010.R40 cars 4280–4281 (originally 4380–4381) were preserved by the New York Transit Museum. They were restored to operating status in 2013-2014 and have been operating on New York City Transit Museum-sponsored excursions since August 2014, specifically on the Train of Many Metals (TOMM). Before cars 4280–4281 were preserved, cars 4192–4193 were temporarily displayed at the New York Transit Museum in 2008, but they were later stripped and reefed.In addition to the R40 pair, several straight-ended R40As have survived, including:

4460 (and its R42 mate 4665) - preserved by the Railway Preservation Corporation and stored at Coney Island Yard. The original mates of each car were damaged in the 1995 Williamsburg Bridge subway crash, and the original R42 mate to 4460 was written off.
4461 (rebuilt into a slant-ended car and renumbered to 4260) - currently at the Randall's Island FDNY Facility, used with R62s 1366 and 1370 as training cars.
Pair 4480–4481 - preserved by the New York Transit Museum. The cars were stored at the Concourse Yard until 2014, when they were moved to the 207th Street Yard.

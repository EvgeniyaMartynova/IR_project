Title: Digitalis lutea
Aspects: {'D. lutea'}

Digitalis lutea, the straw foxglove or small yellow foxglove, is a short-lived perennial plant.

The flowers are tubular, yellow, with brown dots on the inside of the corolla. Flowers are borne beginning in late spring, then sporadically throughout the summer and fall.
Like many foxgloves, this plant is often grown in gardens, where it readily self-sows and can become weedy.

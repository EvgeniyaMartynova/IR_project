WCFT-FM (106.5 FM, "Bigfoot Country") is an American country music formatted radio station licensed to serve Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by Seven Mountains Media, through licensee Southern Belle, LLC, and is operated out of studios in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. WCFT-FM reaches the northern and eastern area of Bigfoot Country's audience. It operates as Bigfoot Country along with sister stations WRBG and WQBG.

== Coverage area ==
WCFT serves the northern and eastern portions of the Bigfoot Country audience, but it has one of the largest coverage areas. Based in Bloomsburg, it easily covers Columbia and Montour Counties, but its signal also reaches well into Luzerne County, Schuylkill County, much of Sullivan County, eastern Lycoming County, Northumberland County, Union County, and eastern Snyder County. The wide coverage area causes significant overlap with other stations in the Bigfoot Country network.

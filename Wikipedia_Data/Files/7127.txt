Title: Schleicher K7
Aspects: {'K7'}

The Schleicher K7 Rhönadler, aka Ka-7 or K-7, is a West German high-wing, two-seat, glider that was designed by Rudolf Kaiser and produced by Alexander Schleicher GmbH & Co.Often referred to as the Ka-7 or K-7, the US Federal Aviation Administration type certificate officially designates it as the K7.


== Design and development ==

The K7 was intended as a two-place trainer with good performance, a rare combination in trainers of its time.The K7 is constructed with a welded steel tube fuselage, covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. The wing is a wooden structure with a doped fabric covering and employs a Goettingen 533 (16%) airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a Goettingen 533 (14%) section at the wing tip. The wing features powerful dive brakes. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel. The earlier Ka-2 variant has a plywood monocoque fuselage.After 550 had been built, the K7 was superseded in production by the Schleicher ASK 13.The K7 can be converted into a K7/13 with a conversion kit to lower the wing to the mid-wing position and installation of a one-piece canopy, rendering the aircraft similar to the ASK-13.


== Operational history ==
A K7 was flown to a new world multi-place glider speed record for flight around a 500 km (311 mi) triangle of 84 km/h (52 mph) in 1964 in South Africa.


== Variants ==
Ka-2
Early version with a plywood monocoque fuselage
K7
Main production version with a steel tube fuselage.
K7/13
K7 converted to a mid-wing arrangement, plus a single piece canopy, to resemble an AS-K 13

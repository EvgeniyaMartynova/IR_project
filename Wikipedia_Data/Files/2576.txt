Title: D'Oyly Carte Island
Aspects: {"D'Oyly Carte"}

D'Oyly Carte Island is a small private island in the River Thames, England, administratively and historically part of Weybridge, near its other inhabited islands and near part of Old Shepperton, on the reach above Sunbury Lock, 200m downstream of Shepperton Lock. Before 1890 the island was known as Folly Eyot.


== Geography ==
The wooded island is 145m in length and, apart from its two points, 30-45m in width.  It is 16.8 miles (27.0 km) from Charing Cross, London. Weybridge is the parish and post town. Elmbridge and Surrey County Council are the district and county level local authorities.


== Etymology ==
The island was, until the eponymous owner bought it, called Folly Eyot.  Richard D'Oyly Carte was the producer of the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas from 1875 to 1896 (such as The Mikado), founder of the Savoy Theatre and Royal English Opera House (now the Palace Theatre) in London and a hotelier. He bought the island around 1890, and it acquired his middle name and surname.


== History ==
Carte intended to use as a special secluded annex, accessible by boat, to his new Savoy Hotel, but a panel of the local magistrates refused to grant him an alcoholic drinks selling licence for the property. Among the famous guests who stayed at Carte's house on the island were the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan. Carte's widow Helen sold the island, and, as of 2019, it was again for sale for Â£3.2 million; House Beautiful reported that the house "has lost the grandeur of its Victorian glory days".


== Features ==
Carte built the main structure on the island, Eyot House, which he used as a residence. It has a large garden, which he and his wife helped to design, surrounded by trees. The house has thirteen bedrooms, five bathrooms, four reception rooms, a ballroom and 1.9 acres of grounds.A small single-span footbridge, built in 1964, provides access to the house. It consists of a very high arch of a single steel box girder with treads, brutalist railings and gates. The island has a marina that provides mooring for small boats.

Title: Warner Bros.-Seven Arts
Aspects: {'W7'}

Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, Inc. was  an American entertainment company active from 1967 until 1970.


== History ==
Warner Bros.-Seven Arts started when Seven Arts Productions acquired Jack L. Warner's controlling interest in Warner Bros. Pictures for $32 million and merged with it in 1967.
The acquisition included the black and white Looney Tunes (plus the non-Harman and Ising Merrie Melodies) library, Warner Bros. Records (which was renamed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Records), and Reprise Records. Later that same year, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts purchased Atlantic Records. Those record labels were combined in 1971 with two other acquisitions (Elektra Records and its sister label Nonesuch Records) in a new holding company, Warner-Elektra-Atlantic, under the direction of Mo Ostin  and Joe Smith.
The head of production was Kenneth Hyman, son of Seven Arts co-founder Eliot Hyman. After Wait Until Dark their first film was Camelot.


== Acquisition by Kinney ==
Warner Bros.-Seven Arts was acquired in 1969 by Kinney National Company, who deleted "Seven Arts" from the company name, and reestablishing it as Warner Bros. Due to a financial scandal over its parking operations, Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as National Kinney Corporation) and changed its name to Warner Communications Inc.
Warner Bros.-Seven Arts subsequently went defunct. It released its final production, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed, in February 1970. The studio's next film, Woodstock, which was released in March, was credited as a Warner Bros. production, and this credit would be applied to all other productions from the studio afterward.

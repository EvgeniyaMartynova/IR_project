Title: Pacific Central Station
Aspects: {'XEA'}

Pacific Central Station is a railway station in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which acts as the western terminus of Via Rail's cross-country The Canadian to Toronto and the northern terminus of Amtrak’s Cascades to Seattle and Portland. The station also provides intercity bus service as the main Vancouver terminal for Greyhound Bus Lines. The station is wheelchair-accessible and is staffed with full Via services.
The Amtrak Cascades provides two daily round trips from Vancouver. One goes to Seattle, Washington; the other continues on to Portland, Oregon. Rather than stopping for an immigration inspection at the border, as happens with the Adirondack to Montreal and Maple Leaf to Toronto, Amtrak passengers go through Canadian customs at the station upon arrival. Passengers bound for the United States go through United States border preclearance prior to boarding in Vancouver.
The Rocky Mountaineer operated from Pacific Central Station until moving to the nearby Rocky Mountaineer Station in 2005; they began to use Pacific Central Station again for their new Coastal Passage route in 2013.

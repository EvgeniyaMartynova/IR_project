DYIO began its test transmission in 1979, and its first official broadcast on March 1, 1980. Originally owned by Trans-Radio Broadcasting Corporation of Emilio Tuason, it was the sister station of Manila-based 99.5 RT. The station's original studio was located at Danaque Building in Osmeña Blvd.Tuason and his cousin Binggoy Remedios were the station's first voices. Y101 adapted RT's iconic slogan "The Rhythm of the City".
Martha Tuason, Emilio's sister, took over the station after the latter stepped down due to illness. Since the 1990s, Y101 transferred its ownership to GVM Radio/TV Corporation, a newly-established company by Martha herself. Under her leadership, Y101 changed its slogan to "Always First", which has been used until today.

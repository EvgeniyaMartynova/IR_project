Title: Mitsubishi Z platform
Aspects: {'Z-car (disambiguation)'}

The Mitsubishi Z platform is a small-car platform jointly developed by DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi Motors since 2001 and used in the Mitsubishi Colt first introduced in 2003. It was also used a year later in the Smart Forfour, and was to have underpinned DaimlerChrysler's Smart Formore mini SUV until that project was discontinued.
The Colt, which is built at the NedCar plant in Born, Netherlands, the Pininfarina carozzeria in Turin, Italy and the Okazaki, Aichi plant in Japan, is the only "Z-car" in production which uses the platform.

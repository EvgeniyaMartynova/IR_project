Afra Airlines also entered a co-operative agreement with CTK - CiTylinK on new regional services. The new service, AfraCityLink, was scheduled to start domestic services on 15 February 2005.Afra Airlines claimed official frustration and corruption by the then Government of Ghana prevented it from operating. As a direct consequence Afra Airlines laid off 40 Ghanaian staff, closed its offices and put its investments in Ghana on hold for the foreseeable future. [1]

Title: Lambert & Butler
Aspects: {'L&B'}

Lambert & Butler is a British brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by Imperial Brands. During a brief period, the company also commercialised association football trading cards.


== History ==
Lambert & Butler cigarettes were launched in Clerkenwell in 1834 by Charles Edward Lambert and Charles Butler, who were among the earliest British cigar manufacturers.

They eventually started selling cigarettes which were being manufactured by John Wood & Son before Lambert & Butler started manufacturing it themselves in 1876 before merging with Imperial Tobacco in 1901. In the late-1800s, it accounted for 20% of total sales value and controlled a large piece of the market with an 1870 capital of £87,200 and 1887 total capital of £175,000, alongside major companies W.D. & H.O. Wills (now Imperial Tobacco) Cope Bros & Co, Hignett Tobacco, John Player & Sons and Stephen Mitchell & Son. In this time, the first largest company in the industry was Wills followed by Cope with Lambert & Butler a strong third and one of Lambert & Butler's most popular brands was Best Bird's Eye.In 1903, after merging with Imperial, an executive committee was formed with one of the members being Charles Lambert. Lambert & Butler also exported to Jamaica with brands Trumpeter and Needle Point. It established its own bonded warehouse in 1891 and was located on Bucknall Street near Long Acre in Westminster, London. Charles Lambert, who was called "the best judge of a Havana cigar" also ran a tobacco shop on Drury Lane. Lambert & Butler was also part of the "big six", with Wills, Taddy & Co, Cope Bros, Hignett Bros and John Player & Sons.Taking advantage of the rise in popularity of football cards in the 1920s and 1930s, Lambert & Butler released a set of association football trading cards in 1931. It consisted of a series of painted portraits that included West Ham's star centre-forward, Vic Watson. Nevertheless, the outbreak of World War II forced tobacco companies to cease production of cigarette cards.

The brand was relaunched in 1979 after an absence. In the late-1990s, their campaign was a distinguished Lambert with his calm butler, Butler, exchanging humorous quotes until the last one which had their faces blurred and the butler saying "It seems we've been outlawed, Sir". In 1999, Lambert & Butler owned 17% of the British cigarette market, 5% more than Benson & Hedges. Due to Imperial Tobacco not owning the trademark on the original name, Lambert & Butler is known in some countries as either L&B or Great & British. It is among the popular and less expensive local brands and, as of 2007, Lambert & Butler King Size were the best-selling brand of cigarettes in the UK.In 2010, the Lambert & Butler brand got officially trademarked under the following words: "L&B LAMBERT & BUTLER ORIGINAL". The brand appealed a file for registration on 17 July 2013 and got officially registered on the 22 July 2014.In 2016, the last factory that still produced cigarettes in Nottingham, United Kingdom  which also produced Lambert & Butler cigarettes, closed its doors for the final time. Imperial Tobacco moved the production to either Poland or Germany, which would increase their profits to £320,000,000.Markets

== Service ==
In 1946, Alamein joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet. In 1948, Alamein, along with her sister-ship HMS Barrosa, escorted the aircraft carrier HMS Vengeance  for exercises in Northern and Home waters, though she did not join the two on their subsequent visit to Northern Ireland.
In 1950, Alamein deployed on a Home Fleet Spring Cruise, which included many other vessels, such as HMS Victorious, two other carriers, the battleship HMS Vanguard and many smaller vessels. The group visited the Mediterranean, including stops at Italy, and performed a number of naval exercises and fly-the-flag visits in the region. That same year, Alamein decommissioned, being placed in Reserve.
In May 1956, Alamein, as part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron once more after replacing her sister ship HMS Aisne, had spells with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets, taking part in the Suez Crisis.
On 5 November 1958, in Chatham Dockyard, a fire occurred onboard Alamein. which was eventually traced to faulty wiring on radio equipment in the Wardroom, which spread to the Ops Room. Fire Parties from Alamein, HMS Corruna, whom she was alongside, plus Chatham & Gillingham fire brigades fought the blaze.
In 1959, Alamein was decommissioned and placed in Reserve for the final time, being broken up at Blyth in Northumberland in 1964.

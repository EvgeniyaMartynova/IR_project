== Critical reception ==
Consequence of Sound wrote of the song that: 'the delivery by Big Sean, manic, almost cartoon-ish in nature, and the beat, this bizarro bump that feels like the best-worst parts of old horror movie soundtracks cut together, work to make it vibrant and appealing, even if it feels overdone'. It was written by HipHopDX that "I Do It" and fellow album track "My Last" both 'showcase Sean’s signature bravado and punchlines'.

Upon the release of Sean's very first album, "I Do It" debuted at number 99 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and rose to its peak of number 92 the following week.

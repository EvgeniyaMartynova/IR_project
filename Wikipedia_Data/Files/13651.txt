Title: Uapou
Aspects: {'U. maculata'}

Uapou is a genus of linyphiid spiders with only one species that has only been found on Ua Pou, one of the Marquesas Islands. The genus was transferred to the family Symphytognathidae by H. W. Levi in 1972, but this was rejected by Brignoli in 1980.


== Nomenclature ==
The genus is named after the island Ua Pou on the Marquesas Islands. The describer, Lucien Berland, named several genera after islands in the Pacific Ocean during the 1930s. Other names derived from islands in the Marquesas are Uahuka and Nukuhiva. The species name is derived from Latin maculata, meaning "spotted".

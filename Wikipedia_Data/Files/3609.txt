Aspects: {'F1 Pole Position'}

Satoru Nakajima F-1 Hero GB World Championship '91 (中嶋悟監修F-1ヒーローGBワールドチャンピオンシップ'91, Nakashima Satoshi Kanshuu Uebu-Wan Hīrō Gēmu Bōi Wārudo Chanpionshippu Nintī Wan) is a 1991 Japan-exclusive Game Boy Formula One video game published by Varie, endorsed by Satoru Nakajima, who was the first full-time Japanese racer in the history of Formula One. Apart from Nakajima, the actual names of the drivers are not used due to licensing arrangements.
There are sixteen rounds and eight difficulty levels. Each level has a special rival to beat. The game structure has few similarities with F-1 Race (Game Boy).

Level 2:  J. Arezi (Jean Alesi)
Level 3:  G. Bergir (Gerhard Berger)

A sequel was released in the following year: Nakajima Satoru: F-1 Hero GB '92: The Graded Driver. This game would be published by Ubisoft in North America and Europe as F1 Pole Position, otherwise unrelated to the SNES game of the same name.

Title: Tuvalu A-Division
Aspects: {'B Division'}

Tuvalu A-Division or The National Provident Fund Championship League  (NPF) is the top football division in Tuvalu. Football in Tuvalu is played at club and national team level. The Tuvalu national football team draws from players in the Tuvalu A-Division; the national team competes in the Pacific Games and South Pacific Games. The national team is controlled by the Tuvalu National Football Association (TNFA).
8 out of the nine islands in Tuvalu are represented in the competition. Niulakita is the only island that has no football club. Some clubs have two teams competing. The competition takes place at the Tuvalu Sports Ground in Funafuti, this is the only soccer field in Tuvalu. Because of this fact all of the clubs are located at the head island but still represent their own eight islands.
The Tuvalu A-division has no relegation rule. The B-Division is the competition for the B teams of each club. The same applies for the C-Division. The competition was founded in 2001.

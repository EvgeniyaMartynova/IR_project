Title: Gephyroberyx darwinii
Aspects: {'G. darwinii'}

Darwin's slimehead (Gephyroberyx darwinii), also known as the big roughy, is a species of fish in the slimehead family found widely in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans. This deep-sea species reaches a length of 60 cm (2.0 ft) and is mainly found at depths of 200 to 500 m (660–1,640 ft), but has been recorded between 9 and 1,210 m (30–3,970 ft). Based on broadly overlapping morphological features it sometimes (e.g., by IUCN) includes G. japonicus as a synonym.

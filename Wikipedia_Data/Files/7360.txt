== History ==
The route was established in 1967 with its current routing in Saline County, with Interstate 135 signed as I-35W. The routing has not been changed. Also, note that K-152 was K-135 at the time. The original K-104 was designated in 1940 from Pittsburg to Missouri. In 1942, it was proposed to be extended west to a rerouted US 160, which was to be rerouted on a route further south. In 1943, US 160 was not moved to the proposed road, but kept its then-current routing. The part of the proposed road from K-7 to US 69 was designated as a new K-104. The old K-104 was renumbered K-126 to match Missouri. The road from K-7 to US 160 became an extension of K-103. In 1958, K-104 and the extension of K-103 became part of a rerouted US 160, as was planned in 1942.. The old route of US 160 became an extension of K-126.

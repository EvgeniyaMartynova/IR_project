Title: Islands (Ash album)
Aspects: {"I Don't Need Your Love (disambiguation)"}

Islands is the seventh studio album by Northern Irish alternative rock band Ash.


== Background ==
The album was announced on 7 February 2018. The artwork depicts one of the Skellig Islands (Skellig Michael) off the South West Coast of Ireland. More importantly, the cover is another nod to the band's love for 'Star Wars' in that various scenes from Episode VII: The Force Awakens and Episode VIII: The Last Jedi were filmed on the islands. The latter film used Skellig Michael as a location for Daisy Ridley's character 'Rey' being trained as a Jedi Knight by Mark Hamill's 'Luke Skywalker'.


== Release ==
The album was released on 18 May 2018 on Infectious Music, who under the name Infectious Recordings, released the band's first five studio albums. The Japanese version contains two bonus tracks not included on the standard edition.


== Critical reception ==
"Islands" received generally favorable reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 73 based on 9 reviews.

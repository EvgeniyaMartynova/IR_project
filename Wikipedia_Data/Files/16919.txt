Title: Zlín Z 26
Aspects: {'Z26'}

The Zlin Trener is a family of aircraft that was based on a basic training aircraft, the Z-26.
The original Z-26 was designed in the 1940s and produced in 1946 by the Czechoslovakian company, Moravan to meet a requirement for a basic trainer to replace the Bücker Jungmann and Bestmann.  It was a low-wing monoplane of mixed construction, with wooden wings and a welded metal tube fuselage, powered by a single four-cylinder piston engine, the Walter Minor 4-III. It first flew in early 1947, proving superior to the competing Praga 112, and was declared the winner, entering production in 1948.Later Z-26 variants were optimised to participate in aerobatic competitions and many were owned by private pilot owners.  Both the two-seat Trener and the single-seat Akrobat were considered highly successful, winning several aerobatic awards in the 1960s.

The following variants were progressive improvements on the Z-26:

Z-526A – single-seat aerobatic aircraft
Z-526F – Improved version. M-137 engine with fuel injector.
Z-726 – modified 526 with shortened wings and fuselafe
Z-726K – with Walter M 337 supercharged engineIn 1956, deliveries began of the Z326 Trener-Master and Z326A Akrobat.  Many sub-variants were also produced, for example the Z-526A and Z-526AFS were aerobatic specials. The production of the family was terminated in the 1970s with Z-726.  The Z-726 Universal had reduced wingspan.

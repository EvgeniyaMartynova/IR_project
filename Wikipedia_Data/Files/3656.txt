Title: Fokker F.XII
Aspects: {'F12'}

The Fokker F.XII was a three-engined high-winged monoplane airliner produced in the 1930s by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker. Two aircraft were built under license by Danish Orlogsværftet. The first was powered by 347 kW (465 hp) Bristol Jupiter VI radial engines and the second, an improved model, the F.XIIM, was about 20 km/h (12 mph) faster than the Dutch-built F.XIIs.


== Operational history ==
Ten aircraft were ordered by KLM/KNILM for operation on the Amsterdam to Batavia route. The first service left Amsterdam on 5 March 1931 arriving in Batavia on 14 March 1931. The aircraft was used regularly on the route from the 1 October 1931. In 1932 KLM started to use the larger Fokker F.VIIIs on the route and the F.XIIs were then used for European destinations.In 1936 KLM sold four of the aircraft to the British Crilly Airways to operate between London and Madrid, this didn't get the support of the Spanish government and the aircraft were passed to British Airways for use on European routes to Paris and Scandinavia.  They were soon considered obsolete by British Airways and sold with some ending up with Spanish Nationalists for use in the civil war.Two of KLMs remaining F.XIIs were sold to British Airways and one to a company in French West Africa but ended up in Spanish Republican hands. The two KNILM aircraft were still in Java when the Japanese invaded in 1942. One additional aircraft the eleventh to be built was ordered by AB Aerotransport of Sweden in 14-passenger configuration and was used in Sweden until destroyed in a hangar collapse in 1947.

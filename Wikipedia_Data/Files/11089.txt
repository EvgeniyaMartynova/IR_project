Aspects: {'Q42'}

ARA Cabo San Antonio (Q42) was a tank landing ship in the Argentine Navy, built in Argentina at AFNE, RÃ­o Santiago shipyard. She was launched on 20 July 1968. Cabo San Antonio was based on the US Navy's De Soto County-class tank landing ship design.


== History ==
The high point of her career was the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) in 1982, as part of Operation Azul.  Cabo San Antonio disembarked with 20 LVTP7 tracked amphibious armoured personnel carriers and LARC-V transports from the 1st Amphibious Vehicles Battalion, carrying D and E Companies of the 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion at Yorke Bay.  She did not participate further in the Falklands War once the British fleet arrived around the islands.
Cabo San Antonio was decommissioned in 1997.

Title: Bandini 1000 V
Aspects: {'V1000'}

The Bandini 1000 V sports prototype is a race car built in 1970 by Bandini Cars Forl√¨.

This two-seater sports together for many years previous 1000/66 (which represents the evolution but not replacement), the Saloncino and the subsequent 1000/72 on the slopes and runs uphill from across Italy.
The now-consolidated characteristics of previous Bandini, plus the latest news from the head completely designed by Ilario Bandini and carried out in aluminium as the entire engine 1000 cc. This provides for the use of vertical Solex carburetors (hence the V the acronym) posts orthogonally to the plan sparked by two camshafts.
Completely new is the choice of the body with a rear section of greater than the rest of the car producing large openings for the engine compartment, as are the new places to flap its four ends with clear aerodynamic function.


== The chassis ==

The frame, a frame of special steel tubes, comes directly from that of 1000/66, although the experience gained from racing, from tests on track and recent birth of Bandini saloncino contribute to the emergence of a chassis that in addition to the two main beams section elliptical also see the use of elements to round section in addition to a different arrangement of weights and engine which takes an Operating increasingly bearing.
New mergers of portamozzi allow a variation of the angles characteristic of suspensions.

== The body ==

The body Bandini aluminum is made up of a removable front quickly, low and round, with a generous air-intake oval in the middle, very similar to the previous 1000/66 but here, is flanked by two fins fixed with two grids outburst in front of the passenger compartment. This part was amended in mid-1972. The space for lighthouses is exploited to increase the strength of air downward, defining more decisively the air-intake that appears even more squared and acquires a much wider outlet. The rear part receives the difference in width than the rest of the car, this creates large air-intakes for the engine side and also thanks to the panel sealing perfectly the engine compartment, door very clean flows to fixed rear flap. In a second time, were also installed screens for the rear wheels that had already been used on "Saponetta" from the runway.

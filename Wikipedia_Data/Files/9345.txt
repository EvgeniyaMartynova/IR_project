== Career ==
Tempest had a short-lived career, serving in the Mediterranean.
She sailed from Malta on the night of 10 February 1942 to patrol the Gulf of Taranto. On the evening of the 11th Tempest was signalled that the Italians were aware of a submarine in her vicinity and that it should be assumed that her patrol had been compromised. On the 13th, Tempest was sighted on the surface by the Spica-class torpedo boat Circe. Tempest crash dived and Circe began depth charging the area, eventually resulting in oil being seen on the surface. Tempest's battery tanks had burst filling the boat with chlorine gas and the vessel was forced to surface, whereupon she was hit by gunfire from Circe. The surviving crew abandoned the submarine, and 24 of the crew of 62 were picked up some three hours later by the Italian warship. One of the survivors later died of his wounds. The Italians attempted to board the abandoned vessel but were unable to, due to rough seas. Instead, the torpedo boat re-opened fire with her 4 inches (100 mm) gun, scoring more than a dozen direct hits, but failing to sink the Tempest. Finally the Italians attempted to take the submarine in tow. Two members of the warshipâ€™s crew boarded the submarine and prepared the tow. As Circe manoeuvred to take up the tow, Tempest suddenly started to sink, forcing those on board to jump into the sea. The submarine slipped beneath the waves stern-first, with the bows disappearing vertically.

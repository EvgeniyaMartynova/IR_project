Title: Wacky Wednesday (book)
Aspects: {'Wacky Wednesday'}

Wacky Wednesday is a book for young readers, written by Dr. Seuss as Theo. LeSieg and illustrated by George Booth.  It has forty-eight pages, and is based around a world of progressively wackier occurrences, where kids can point out that there is a palm tree growing in the toilet, an earthworm chasing a bird, a plane flying backward, a traffic light showing that green means stop and red means go, and a tiger chauffeur, as a few examples.


== Plot ==
The main character, a boy wakes up to find a shoe on the wall; then he looks up to find one on the ceiling as well. With each new page, the number of "wacky" things grows, as the boy goes through his morning routine and makes it to George Washington School, trying to alert others to the wacky occurrences. The classmates ignore his warnings, and his teacher, Miss Bass, thinks he is disrupting the class and throws him out.
As the world gets crazier and crazier, the boy runs around trying to escape it or find help, and eventually runs into Patrolman McGann, who declares that Wacky Wednesday will end as soon as every last wacky thing has been counted â€“ the final page having 20 in total.
At the end, the shoe on the wall is gone.

Aspects: {'H-matrix'}

In linear algebra, a Hankel matrix (or catalecticant matrix), named after Hermann Hankel, is a square matrix in which each ascending skew-diagonal from left to right is constant, e.g.:

The Hankel matrix is a symmetric matrix.
The Hankel matrix is closely related to the Toeplitz matrix (a Hankel matrix is an upside-down Toeplitz matrix). For a special case of this matrix see Hilbert matrix.
A Hankel operator on a Hilbert space is one whose matrix with respect to an orthonormal basis is a (possibly infinite) Hankel matrix

== Applications of Hankel matrices ==
Hankel matrices are formed when, given a sequence of output data, a realization of an underlying state-space or hidden Markov model is desired.  The singular value decomposition of the Hankel matrix provides a means of computing the A, B, and C matrices which define the state-space realization. The Hankel matrix formed from the signal has been found useful for decomposition of non-stationary signals and time-frequency representation.

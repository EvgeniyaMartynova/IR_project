Title: R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour
Aspects: {'R30'}

R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour is a live DVD by the Canadian rock band Rush, released on November 22, 2005 in Canada and the US, and November 28, 2005 in Europe. The DVD documents the band's R30: 30th Anniversary Tour, and was recorded on September 24, 2004 at the Festhalle Frankfurt, Germany.  
The DVD was released in both a standard and a deluxe set. The deluxe version features two additional audio CDs of the DVD content, as well as various interviews, and extra live footage.
To reduce overlap with the band's 2003 release Rush in Rio, eight songs were cut from both DVD versions: "Bravado", "One Little Victory", "By-Tor and the Snow Dog", "La Villa Strangiato", "YYZ", "Red Sector A", "The Trees", and "Secret Touch". The audio CDs in the deluxe DVD version present the shortened set-list as well. Five of the deleted songs were later released: 

"Red Sector A" on the Snakes & Arrows Live DVD (2008)
"Secret Touch" on the DVD included with the two-disc version of the Retrospective III: 1989–2008 compilation (2009)
"One Little Victory" on the DVD included with the two-disc version of the Working Men compilation (2009)
"Bravado" and "YYZ" as bonus features for the home media release of the documentary film Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage (2010)The R30 track "Der Trommler" is a drum solo by Neil Peart. The track "R30 Overture" is an instrumental medley of six early Rush songs, one from each of the first six studio albums, with flashes of the band's history appearing in the background at the concerts. The R30 releases also feature four songs from the band's 2004 "cover" EP Feedback.
A Blu-ray version of R30, containing the complete concert, was released on December 8, 2009 in the US, and in late 2013 in Europe.

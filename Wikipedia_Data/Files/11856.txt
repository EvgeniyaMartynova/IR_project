Title: Llobregat–Anoia Line
Aspects: {'R60', 'R50', 'R6'}

The Llobregat–Anoia Line (Catalan: Línia Llobregat-Anoia) is an unconnected metre gauge railway line linking Barcelona with the Baix Llobregat, Bages and Anoia regions, in Catalonia, Spain. Its name refers to the fact that it follows the course of the Llobregat and Anoia rivers for most of its length. Plaça d'Espanya station serves as the Barcelona terminus of the line, then continuing northwards to Martorell, where two main branches to Manresa and Igualada are formed. It also includes several freight branches, accounting for a total line length of 138 kilometres (86 mi) and 41 passenger stations.
Barcelona Metro rapid transit line 8, together with a number of commuter and freight rail services, runs on the line's main route between Barcelona and Sant Boi de Llobregat. The section between Barcelona and Olesa de Montserrat is operated as a high-frequency commuter rail system known as Baix Llobregat Metro (Catalan: Metro del Baix Llobregat), with some services continuing northwards to Manresa and Igualada. This system further includes the temporarily closed Olesa de Montserrat–Esparreguera Cable Car, which is also operated by FGC. The Llobregat–Anoia Line is part of the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM) fare-integrated public transport system for the Barcelona metropolitan area.


== Development plans ==
In January 2017, the Catalan government approved a plan to extend the Llobregat–Anoia line from Plaça d'Espanya through the city as far as Gràcia station, also stopping at Hospital Clínic and Francesc Macià station, thereby linking with the Barcelona–Vallès Line, at an estimated cost of over €300 million. A second phase is also being considered to extend the line towards the Besòs station in the eastern part of the city.

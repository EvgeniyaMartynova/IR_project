Title: Elongate twig ant
Aspects: {'P. gracilis'}

The elongated twig ant, or Pseudomyrmex gracilis,  is a large, slender species native to Mexico and arid parts of the US. The workers are about 7–12 millimeters (0.28–0.47 in) in length and generally wasp-like in appearance and style of movement. Worker ants are bi-colored; the head and gaster are dark, while the antennae, mouthparts, thorax and legs are dull orange with dark shading. They often may be seen on vegetation, foraging for live insects or collecting honeydew from sap-sucking insects.

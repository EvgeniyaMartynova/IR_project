Title: Saffron darter
Aspects: {'E. flavum'}

The saffron darter (Etheostoma flavum) is a species of darter endemic to the eastern United States, where it is found in Kentucky and Tennessee in the lower Cumberland River and also the lower Tennessee River drainages. It inhabits streams and rocky pools and nearby riffles of creeks, headwaters and small rivers. This species can reach a length of 7 cm (2.8 in).


== Appearance and Anatomy ==
Like many snubnose darters, they have a blunt snout. Typically,nuptial males have a uniformly yellow lower side and olive upper side as compared to E. duryi, which has an orange to red lower and upper side. E. flavum adult males have yellow to orange lips while E. duryi has green or gray lips. Lastly, the mid-lateral stripe pigmentation in E. flavum is nearly as dark as the 7-9 black lateral blotches (Etnier & Bailey, 1989). 


== Distribution ==
Can be found in the lower Cumberland and Tennessee river drainages in Kentucky and Tennessee, upstream in Cumberland River drainages to Harpeth River, upstream in Tennessee River drainages (east side only), to upper Duck River, upper Buffalo River, and Indian River (Etnier & Bailey, 1989). 


== Ecology ==
Inhabits rocky pools and adjacent riffles of headwaters, creeks, and small rivers. Some biologists believe that E. flavum is one of the most abundant darters in the second and fourth order streams (Etnier & Bailey, 1989).

Title: N-ary associativity
Aspects: {'N-ary'}

In algebra, n-ary associativity is a generalization of the associative law to n-ary operations. Ternary associativity is

(abc)de = a(bcd)e = ab(cde),i.e. the string abcde with any three adjacent elements bracketed.  n-ary associativity is a string of length n + (n âˆ’ 1) with any n adjacent elements bracketed.

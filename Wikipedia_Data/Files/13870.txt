Aspects: {"U'wa"}

== Varieties ==
There are half a dozen known varieties. Communication between modern varieties can be difficult, so they are considered distinct languages.
Adelaar (2004) lists the living 

central dialects Cobaría and Tegría on the northern slopes of the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy,
a western group near Agua Blanca in the departments of Santander and Norte de Santander,
an eastern group at a place called Barro Negro in the lowlands of Arauca and Casanare,
and the extinct dialect Sínsiga near Chita, Boyacá.Umaña (2012) lists Cobaría, Tegría, Agua Blanca, Barro Negro.Berich lists the dialects Cobaría; Agua Blanca (= Uncasía, Tamarana, Sta Marta); Rinconada, Tegría, Bócota, & Báchira
Cassani lists Sínsiga, Tegría, Unkasía (= Margua), Pedraza, Manare, Dobokubí (= Motilón)
Osborn (1989) lists

Yithkaya (= San Miguel / Barro Negro),
Bahiyakuwa (= Sínsiga),

Fabre (2005) lists:

Bontoca (perhaps the same as the Bókota = Kaibaká cited in Osborn), of the mountains of Guican
Cobaría, along the Cobaría River
Pedraza or Bethuwa [= Angosturas?], along the Venezuelan border; extinct
Sínsiga, in the Guican mountains, recorded from Chita, Boyaca in 1871
Tegría or Tagrinuwa, along the Cobaría River
Unkasia, along the Chitiga and Marga rivers (Telban 1988)Additional names in Loukotka are Manare and Uncasica (presumably a spelling variant of Unkasía/Uncacía), as well as Morcote, of which nothing is known. Manare, at the source of the Casanare, is Eastern Tunebo.

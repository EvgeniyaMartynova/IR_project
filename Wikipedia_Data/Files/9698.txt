=== Dutch ===
In Dutch, the acute Ó accent is used to mark different meanings for words, for example voor/vóór ("for" / "before"), or vóórkomen/voorkómen ("to occur" / "to prevent").


=== Emilian-Romagnol ===

=== Irish ===
Ó is widely used in Irish where it has various meanings:

the preposition ó "from"
the patronymic term Ó "grandson, (usually male) descendant", first or second cousin" (variants: Ua, Uí, Í Uaí). When Irish names were anglicized, the Ó commonly was either dropped or written as O'.
the interjection ó "oh"


=== Italian ===
In Italian, ó is an optional symbol (especially used in dictionaries) sometimes used to indicate that a stressed o should be pronounced with a close sound: córso [ˈkorso], "course", as opposed to còrso [ˈkɔrso], "Corsican" (but both are commonly written with no accent marks when the context is clear). A similar process may occur with é and è, as in *pésca, "fishing", and *pèsca "peach", in which the accent mark is not written (both are written as pesca).

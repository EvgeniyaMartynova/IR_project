Title: N-sphere
Aspects: {'ùïä'}

In mathematics, the n-sphere is the generalization of the ordinary sphere to spaces of arbitrary dimension.  It is an n-dimensional manifold that can be embedded in Euclidean (n + 1)-space.
The 0-sphere is a pair of points, the 1-sphere is a circle, and the 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere.  Generally, when embedded in an (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, an n-sphere is the surface or boundary of an (n + 1)-dimensional ball.  That is, for any natural number n, an n-sphere of radius r may be defined in terms of an embedding in (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space as the set of points that are at distance r from a central point, where the radius r may be any positive real number. Thus, the n-sphere would be defined by:

  
    
      
        
          S
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          {
          
            x
            ‚àà
            
              
                R
              
              
                n
                +
                1
              
            
            :
            
              ‚Äñ
              x
              ‚Äñ
            
            =
            r
          
          }
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S^{n}=\left\{x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}:\left\|x\right\|=r\right\}.}
  In particular:

the pair of points at the ends of a (one-dimensional) line segment is a 0-sphere,
the circle, which is the one-dimensional circumference of a (two-dimensional) disk in the plane is a 1-sphere,
the two-dimensional surface of a (three-dimensional) ball in three-dimensional space is a 2-sphere, often simply called a sphere,
the three-dimensional boundary of a (four-dimensional) 4-ball in four-dimensional Euclidean is a 3-sphere, also known as a glome.
the n-1 dimensional boundary of a (n-dimensional) n-ball is a general n-sphere which can be denoted as a "glone".An n-sphere embedded in an (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space is called a hypersphere.  The n-sphere of unit radius is called the unit n-sphere, denoted Sn, often referred to as the n-sphere.
When embedded as described, an n-sphere is the surface or boundary of an (n + 1)-dimensional ball. For n ‚â• 2, the n-spheres are the simply connected n-dimensional manifolds of constant, positive curvature. The n-spheres admit several other topological descriptions: for example, they can be constructed by gluing two n-dimensional Euclidean spaces together, by identifying the boundary of an n-cube with a point, or (inductively) by forming the suspension of an (n ‚àí 1)-sphere.


== Description ==
For any natural number n, an n-sphere of radius r is defined as the set of points in (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space that are at distance r from some fixed point c, where r may be any positive real number and where c may be any point in (n + 1)-dimensional space. In particular:

a 0-sphere is a pair of points {c ‚àí r, c + r}, and is the boundary of a line segment (1-ball).
a 1-sphere is a circle of radius r centered at c, and is the boundary of a disk (2-ball).
a 2-sphere is an ordinary 3-dimensional sphere in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and is the boundary of an ordinary ball (3-ball).
a 3-sphere is a sphere in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.


=== Euclidean coordinates in (n + 1)-space ===
The set of points in (n + 1)-space, (x1, x2, ..., xn+1), that define an n-sphere, Sn, is represented by the equation:

            2

                  i
                
              
              ‚àí
              
                c
                
                  i
                
              
            
            )

    {\displaystyle r^{2}=\sum _{i=1}^{n+1}\left(x_{i}-c_{i}\right)^{2}}
  where c=(c1, c2, ..., cn+1) is a center point, and r is the radius.
The above n-sphere exists in (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space and is an example of an n-manifold.  The volume form œâ of an n-sphere of radius r is given by

=== n-ball ===

The space enclosed by an n-sphere is called an (n + 1)-ball. An (n + 1)-ball is closed if it includes the n-sphere, and it is open if it does not include the n-sphere.
Specifically:

A 1-ball, a line segment, is the interior of a 0-sphere.
A 2-ball, a disk, is the interior of a circle (1-sphere).
A 3-ball, an ordinary ball, is the interior of a sphere (2-sphere).
A 4-ball is the interior of a 3-sphere, etc.


=== Topological description ===
Topologically, an n-sphere can be constructed as a one-point compactification of n-dimensional Euclidean space.  Briefly, the n-sphere can be described as Sn = Rn ‚à™ {‚àû}, which is n-dimensional Euclidean space plus a single point representing infinity in all directions.
In particular, if a single point is removed from an n-sphere, it becomes homeomorphic to Rn. This forms the basis for stereographic projection.

Aspects: {'F Line'}

The F Line is one of six RapidRide lines (routes with some bus rapid transit features) operated by King County Metro in King County, Washington. The F Line began service on June 7, 2014, running between the Burien Transit Center and "The Landing" in north Renton. Other major stops and destinations served include Tukwila International Boulevard Link Station, Southcenter Mall, Tukwila Sounder/Amtrak Station, South Renton Park and Ride, Renton Transit Center and the Boeing Renton Factory.

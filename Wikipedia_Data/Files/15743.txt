== History ==

Formerly known as Montbrook Army Air Field during World War II, the airfield was opened as a US Army Air Forces installation on January 1, 1942.  It appears to have been closed by the end of 1944.
In 1974, the facility was deeded to the City of Williston. It serves as a basic utility airport in Levy County for the City of Archer, City of Bronson, City of McIntosh, City of Reddick and the City of Williston. It is one of two airports in the county, serving alongside the George T. Lewis Airport in Cedar Key.
A planned upgrade of the airport slowly started with annexation of land in 1988. In 1992, it was selected as a preferred location for a regional airport within 20 miles (32 km). A second, larger, runway was completed by 2002 and allowed for jet aircraft to use the facility. An Automated Weather Observation Station (AWOS) was installed at the airport by the end of 2005. Future upgrades on the 2,000 acre (8 km²) site include additional hangars, a corporate hangar park and a new fixed-base operator.

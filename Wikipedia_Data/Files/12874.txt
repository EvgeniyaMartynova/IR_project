Tittsworth established his own record label in 2006 with partner DJ Ayres, T&A records. T&A Records has played an important role in cultivating multiple movements in dance music, especially Baltimore club and moombahton. Moombahton rhythms and influences continue to be found in wide-reaching music today, starting with Spotify's most-streamed moments.Tittsworth has released over a dozen vinyl records, including Ammo's last release (A-Trak's battle imprint), a highly sought after white Serato record and a variety of dance records since 2005.Tittsworth's debut album was called "12 Steps." The LP featured Pitbull, Nina Sky, Kid Sister and The Federation to name a few. The Pitbull collaboration predated the EDM influx and gained the eye of Ministry of Sound. Follow up songs included the moombahton classic Pendejas with Alvin Risk. Also with Alvin Risk (featuring Maluca) was La Campana, which appeared on FIFA 12.

His next single "After The Dance" featured Q-Tip and Theophilus London and was lauded by critics as "a timeless dancefloor motivator that would fit as well in a set with say "Rapture" as "Step Into A World".

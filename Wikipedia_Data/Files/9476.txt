Title: Waco 10
Aspects: {'O series'}

The Waco 10/GXE/Waco O series was a range of three-seat open-cockpit biplanes built by the Advance Aircraft Company, later the Waco Aircraft Company.


== Design and development ==
The Waco 10 was a larger span development of the Waco 9, both single-engined three-seat single-bay biplanes constructed around steel-tube frames.  The wing covering was fabric, and both upper and lower planes carried ailerons, which were strut linked.  The two passengers sat side by side in a cockpit under the upper wing and ahead of the pilot, who had a separate cockpit.  It had a split-axle fixed undercarriage and a tailwheel. The main undercarriage was fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers, unusual at the time on a light aircraft. The fin could be trimmed on the ground to offset engine torque, and the tailplane could be trimmed in flight.  Initially it was powered by a Curtiss OX-5 water-cooled 90° V-8 engine producing 90 hp (67 kW).
Its first flight was in 1927. It was numerically the most important type to be built by Waco, with at least 1,623 built over a period of 7 years from 1927 to 1933 and was fitted with a very large variety of engines of radial and V configuration.


== Operational history ==
The Waco 10 turned out to have excellent handling, and there was a ready supply of war-surplus Curtiss engines.  It was widely used for the popularisation of aeronautics through barnstorming and joyrides, and was also much used as a trainer and by small operators for charter flights.


== Variants ==
In 1928, after the Waco 10 had entered production, Waco changed its designation system so that the basic model 10, powered by a 90 hp (67 kW) Curtiss OX-5 engine became the GXE. The OX-5 was also used in the Waco 9, and this led to the confusing popular description of both aircraft as Waco 90, after the power.

Later aircraft used a three-letter designation, the first denoting the engine, the second, S or T meaning Straight or Tapered wing and the final O indicating it belongs to the Waco O series for open cockpit.  An -A suffix indicated an armed variant intended for export.

Apart from the Curtiss and Hispano-Suiza, all of these engines were air-cooled radials.
Other engines were fitted experimentally, without unique designations, including Rausie, Siemans, and the 115 hp (86 kW) Milwaukee Tank engine. This was an air-cooled version of the Curtiss OX-5, and was intended as an aircraft engine.
Two mailplane derivatives from the O series (types JYM and JWM) were single seaters with a 14" stretch in the fuselage.
In the 1990s The WACO Aircraft Company of Quillayute Airport in Forks, Washington offered a kit version of the ATO model, featuring completely re-drawn plans, a book of plans for the small parts and an instruction manual.The WACO 240-A was a straight-wing fighter, built for export, powered by 240 hp Wright engine. At least six were bought by Cantonese Chinese aviation. They were armed with twin .30 Browning machine guns and had racks for five 25 lb or two 100 lb bombs.There was also an export model WACO Pursuit 300T-A, with 300 hp Wright or Wasp Jr engine.

Title: Panthera crassidens
Aspects: {'P. crassidens'}

Panthera crassidens is an extinct felid that lived during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene in Africa, and is related to the leopard (Panthera pardus). It has been argued that the few fossil remains that were classified under P. crassidens do not represent a genuine species, and instead belong to some other form of big cat.

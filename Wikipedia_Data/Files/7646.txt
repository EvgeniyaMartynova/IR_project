Title: L-theory
Aspects: {'L-group'}

In mathematics algebraic L-theory is the K-theory of quadratic forms; the term was coined by C. T. C. Wall, 
with L being used as the letter after K. Algebraic L-theory, also known as 'hermitian K-theory',
is important in surgery theory.


== Definition ==
One can define L-groups for any ring with involution R: the quadratic L-groups 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{*}(R)}
   (Wall) and the symmetric L-groups 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{*}(R)}
   (Mishchenko, Ranicki).


=== Even dimension ===
The even-dimensional L-groups 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            2
            k
          
        
        (
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{2k}(R)}
   are defined as the Witt groups of ε-quadratic forms over the ring R with 
  
    
      
        ϵ
        =
        (
        −
        1
        
          )
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon =(-1)^{k}}
  . More precisely, 

  
    
      
        
          L
          
            2
            k
          
        
        (
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{2k}(R)}
  is the abelian group of equivalence classes 
  
    
      
        [
        ψ
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [\psi ]}
   of non-degenerate ε-quadratic forms 
  
    
      
        ψ
        ∈
        
          Q
          
            ϵ

        F
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi \in Q_{\epsilon }(F)}
   over R, where the underlying R-modules F are finitely generated free. The equivalence relation is given by stabilization with respect to hyperbolic ε-quadratic forms: 

  
    
      
        [

        ]
        =

=== Odd dimension ===
Defining odd-dimensional L-groups is more complicated; further details and the definition of the odd-dimensional L-groups can be found in the references mentioned below.


== Examples and applications ==
The L-groups of a group 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   are the L-groups 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        
          Z
        
        [
        π
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{*}(\mathbf {Z} [\pi ])}
   of the group ring 
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
        [
        π
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} [\pi ]}
  . In the applications to topology  
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   is the fundamental group

        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X)}
   of a space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}

    {\displaystyle n>4}
  , and in the formulation of the Novikov conjecture.
The distinction between symmetric L-groups and quadratic L-groups, indicated by upper and lower indices, reflects the usage in group homology and cohomology. The group cohomology 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            ∗

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} _{2}}
   deals with the fixed points of a 
  
    
      
        
          
            Z

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} _{2}}
  -action, while the group homology 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{*}}
   deals with the orbits of a 
  
    
      
        
          
            Z
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} _{2}}
  -action; compare 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            G
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X^{G}}
   (fixed points) and 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            G
          
        
        =
        X
        
          /
        
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{G}=X/G}
   (orbits, quotient) for upper/lower index notation.
The quadratic L-groups: 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            n
          
        
        (
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{n}(R)}
   and the symmetric L-groups: 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            n
          
        
        (
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{n}(R)}
   are related by 
a symmetrization map 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            n
          
        
        (
        R
        )
        →
        
          L
          
            n
          
        
        (
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{n}(R)\to L^{n}(R)}
   which is an isomorphism modulo 2-torsion, and which corresponds to the polarization identities.
The quadratic and the symmetric L-groups are 4-fold periodic (the comment of Ranicki, page 12, on the non-periodicity of the symmetric L-groups refers to another type of L-groups, defined using "short complexes").
In view of the applications to the classification of manifolds there are extensive calculations of
the quadratic 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
  -groups 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        
          Z
        
        [
        π
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{*}(\mathbf {Z} [\pi ])}
  . For finite 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
  
algebraic methods are used, and mostly geometric methods (e.g. controlled topology) are used for infinite 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
  . 
More generally, one can define L-groups for any additive category with a chain duality, as in Ranicki (section 1).


=== Integers ===
The simply connected L-groups are also the L-groups of the integers, as

  
    
      
        L
        (
        e
        )
        :=
        L
        (
        
          Z
        
        [
        e
        ]
        )
        =
        L
        (
        
          Z
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(e):=L(\mathbf {Z} [e])=L(\mathbf {Z} )}
   for both 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   = 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{*}}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∗
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{*}.}
   For quadratic L-groups, these are the surgery obstructions to simply connected surgery.
The quadratic L-groups of the integers are:

                =

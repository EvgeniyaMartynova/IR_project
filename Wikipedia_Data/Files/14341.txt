Title: LNER Class V4
Aspects: {'V4'}

The London and North Eastern Railway Class V4 was a class of 2-6-2 steam locomotive designed by
Sir Nigel Gresley for mixed-traffic use. It was Gresley's last design for the LNER before he died in 1941. The V4s had similarities in their appearance and mechanical layout to the V2 "Green Arrow" class. The V2s, introduced some years before, were large and heavy locomotives, with very limited route availability. The V4 was a lightweight alternative, suitable for use over the whole of the LNER network.


== Features ==
Two locomotives were built at the LNER's Doncaster Works in 1941. The first engine, 3401 Bantam Cock, had a scaled-down version of the Gresley Pacific boiler with a grate area of 27.5 sq ft. Its tractive effort of 27,000 lbs was produced by boiler pressure of 250 psi and three cylinders of 15-inch diameter. The second locomotive, 3402, incorporated a fully welded steel firebox and a single thermic syphon for water circulation. It was not named, but was known unofficially as "Bantam Hen".


== Performance ==
The type was tried on the Great Eastern section of the LNER, and was well received, with more power than the existing B17s and better riding qualities. It was anticipated that many more would be produced, but after the death of Gresley and his succession by Edward Thompson, no more were built. Instead, the LNER Thompson Class B1 was adopted as the LNER's standard mixed-traffic locomotive.


== Service in Scotland ==
The two locomotives were sent to Scotland for use on the West Highland Line, although their wheel arrangement was not particularly suitable for the steep gradients on the line.  They were renumbered 1700 and 1701 in 1946, and later became British Railways 61700 and 61701.


== Withdrawal ==
Both were scrapped in 1957 when their boilers became due for renewal. 


== New Build V4 ==
At the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust Silver Jubilee Convention, it was announced that after the completion of no. 2007 "Prince of Wales", they would begin construction on a new V4 which will be number 3403 (61702). The name that will be given to the engine hasn't yet been confirmed.. On the 6th of September, 2018, the A1 Trust officially announced that it had started the pre-launch stage for project, with a projected cost of Â£3 million pounds, and an estimated starting date of 2021. The project is estimated to take around 5 years. There are already parts for the V4 at Darlington Locomotive Works, including a complete set of tyres (originally made for a group in the 1990s who planned to build a V4), a chimney, and speedometer drives of a Class 08.

Title: Meridian and Bigbee Railroad
Aspects: {'M&B'}

The M&B Railroad (reporting mark MNBR), formerly the Meridian and Bigbee Railroad, is a Class III railroad that operates 189 miles of railroad from Meridian, Mississippi eastward to Burkville, Alabama. Additionally, the M&B has trackage rights over CSX from Burkeville to Montgomery, Alabama.
The M&B is owned by Genesee and Wyoming Inc. After Hurricane Katrina damaged the CSX mainline in Louisiana in 2005, it served as a run-through bridge route for CSX to connect with Union Pacific via the Kansas City Southern between Meridian and Shreveport, LA, thereby avoiding interchange at New Orleans. Due to the volume of trains being handed over to the M&B, the railroad suffered severe crew shortages throughout the timespan of the detours. CSX trains could be found sitting idle at both ends of the railroad awaiting crews. These problems were further enhanced by the horrible track conditions on the M&B mainline, resulting in widespread 10 mph slow orders. It routinely took 12 hours or more for a single train to traverse the entire route. Due to the abnormal curvature prevalent on the mainline, the M&B stipulated that all 6-axle locomotives on these trains be equipped with radial trucks to reduce rail wear and prevent derailments. In September 2007, all remaining interchange between KCS and CSX via the M&B was moved to other lines. This was due in part to the stipulation that no CSX trains would be allowed to run via the KCS after the joint NS/KCS Meridian Speedway venture was completed.


== History ==
The M&B was chartered on December 24, 1926. Construction advanced eastward to Cromwell, Alabama in April 1928, and finally to Myrtlewood, Alabama where it connected with the L&N in 1935. The railroad operated with steam locomotives until 1953. Today, engine #116, a 2-8-0 Consolidation built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1917 originally for the Susquehanna and New York Railroad is the only surviving M&B steam locomotive left. It is currently on display at Highland Park in Meridian.In 2003 the M&B took over the ex-L&N line from Myrtlewood to Selma, Alabama and the ex-Western Railway of Alabama line from Selma to Burkville. CSX retained ownership between Montgomery and Burkville, where there is a large industrial customer.
In 2007, the line gained publicity when a train hauling parts of the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster derailed on an overloaded bridge weakened by heavy rains.

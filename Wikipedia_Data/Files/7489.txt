Title: Kaba, Kyrgyzstan
Aspects: {'Kaba'}

Kaba is a village in Jalal-Abad Region of Kyrgyzstan. Its population was 1,598 in 2009. Although located in Kyrgyzstan, the settlement is also known as Uzbek-Gava. It has been a sticking point in negotiations with Uzbekistan. Since 2001, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have intermittently convened a joint border delimitation commission. From 2002 and after, progress toward completion has been largely stalled by the most controversial points. According to Борис ГОЛОВАНОВ, the main disputed areas have been the enclaves of Barak and Sokh and the areas of Uzbek-Gava and Gavasay (stream). Through 2014 the positions of the parties regarding these sites have remained far from convergence.

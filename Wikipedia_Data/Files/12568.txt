It is found in the south-eastern part of the Amazon rainforest, with a disjunct population in Serra de Baturité in the Brazilian state of Ceará. Except for the bill-pattern, it resembles the spot-billed toucanet, and the two have been considered conspecific in the past. It weighs 131–209 grams (4.6–7.4 oz.)The common name commemorates the English ornithologist and bird artist John Gould (1804–1881). Gould's toucanet was originally described in the genus Pteroglossus.

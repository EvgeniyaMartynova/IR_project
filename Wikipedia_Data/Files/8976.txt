Title: Grey-cheeked nunlet
Aspects: {'N. frontalis'}

The grey-cheeked nunlet (Nonnula frontalis) is a species of puffbird in the family Bucconidae.
It is found in Colombia and Panama.
Its natural habitats are subtropical and tropical moist lowland forests and heavily degraded former forest.


== Taxonomy ==
The grey-cheeked nunlet was first described by P.L. Sclater in 1854 in Colombia. Three subspecies are generally recognized. One of these, the nominate, has been suggested to constitute more than one taxon based on differences in coloration observed in specimens. This species forms a superspecies with the rufous-capped nunlet (Nonnula ruficapilla) of southern Amazonia and the chestnut-headed nunlet (Nonnula amaurocephala), which is restricted to a small area in northwest Brazil.


== Distribution ==
The grey-cheeked nunlet has a relatively large range which extends from central Panama to north-central Colombia. Within this area, it inhabits the lower levels of moist lowland forests, including riverine patches, second growth woodlands, and thickets. This species also occurs in heavily degraded former forests.


== Description ==
The grey-cheeked nunlet averages 15 cm (5.9 in). This species has a long, slender, and slightly decurved blue gray bill. The cheek patch is grey with a red eyering. The upperparts are mostly brown, with some rufous on the crown. The underparts are bright cinnamon, becoming buffy white on the belly.


== Diet and Behavior ==
This nunlet occasionally joins mixed-species foraging flocks, and has been observed taking a variety of insect prey. The nesting behavior of the entire genus Nonnula is poorly understood, and to date, a nest of the grey-cheeked nunlet remains to be discovered.

K-152 is a 12.919-mile-long (20.791 km) eastâ€“west state highway located entirely within Linn County in the U.S. state of Kansas. K-152's western terminus is at K-7 east of the City of Parker and south of Cadmus, and the eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 69 (US-69) east of the City of La Cygne. K-152 was first designated as K-35 in 1927, then renumbered to K-135 in 1957 and then to K-152 in 1977.


== Route description ==
K-152 begins at an intersection with K-7 south of Cadmus and begins traveling east. It passes an intersection with Kettle Road then Lamb Road and after roughly 2.5 miles (4.0 km) reaches an intersection with Long Road. At this point it curves northward for 1 mile (1.6 km) then curves back eastward. From here it continues eastward another roughly 4.5 miles (7.2 km) and then crosses the Marais des Cygnes River. After crossing the river it enters La Cygne and travels roughly 1.5 miles (2.4 km) through the city. Roughly .5 miles (0.80 km) after exiting the city it crosses Middle Creek, a tributary of Marais des Cygnes River. From here it continues another roughly 2 miles (3.2 km) and makes a series of 3 curves. From the curves K-152 continues east for a short distance before reaching its eastern terminus at US-69.From the western terminus, the first 8 miles (13 km) is paved with partial design bituminous pavement and the remainder is paved with composite pavement. K-152 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-152 does connect to the National Highway System at its eastern terminus at US-69. 2017 Annual average daily traffic (AADT) on K-152 ranged from 675 near the western terminus to 2780 slightly east of La Cynge. Other AADT was 2000 west of La Cynge and 2310 by the eastern terminus.


== History ==
K-152 was first designated by KDOT in 1927 as K-35, and at that time ran from K-7 eastward to US-73E. US-73E was redesignated as US-69 sometime between 1933 and 1936. Then on January 7, 1937 K-35 was realigned further south to end further south on K-7. In a June 13, 1938 resolution K-35 was realigned at the crossing of the Marais Des Cygnes River, by La Cygne, to eliminate 3 unsafe sharp curves. Then on October 15, 1957 K-35 was renumbered to K-135 to avoid confusion with the newly constructed Interstate 35 (I-35). In a September 13, 1976 I-35W was renumbered to I-135. Then in order to avoid confusion with I-135, K-135 was renumbered to K-152.

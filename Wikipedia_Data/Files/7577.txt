Title: Kabe Station (Hiroshima)
Aspects: {'Kabe Station', 'Kabe'}

Kabe Station (可部駅, Kabe-eki) is a railway station on the Kabe Line in Asakita-ku, Hiroshima, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. It is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). From December 1, 2003 to March 4, 2017, it was the terminal station of the Kabe Line.


== Station layout ==

Kabe Station has two side platforms handling two tracks. Before the extension to Aki-Kameyama Station, the station handled three tracks. Tracks one and two were bay platforms, and handled trains heading towards Hiroshima Station. The third track was bidirectional, and also led towards the abandoned portion of the Kabe line.

=== Toilet facilities ===
Prior to 2006, a unisex restroom was located outside the station before passing through the ticket gates. While the station is within the city of Hiroshima, this restroom featured a pit-style toilet which had to be pumped regularly in order to remove the accumulated waste. The station had developed somewhat of a bad reputation because of this due to the lingering odor. This issue was resolved in 2006 with the replacement of gender-specific restrooms featuring standard flush toilets connected to the city's sewer system.

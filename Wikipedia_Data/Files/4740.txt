Title: China National Highway 101
Aspects: {'G101'}

China National Highway 101 is a major trunk route connecting Beijing to Shenyang, Liaoning. In Beijing it is known as Jingshun Road (Chinese: 京顺路) or Jingmi Road (Chinese: 京密路) for connecting central Beijing to Shunyi District and Miyun District, although the actual road goes far beyond these two locations.
It leaves Beijing at Dongzhimen and heads for Sanyuanqiao, running alongside the Airport Expressway until Beigao, and then continues north while leaning toward the Jingcheng Expressway.

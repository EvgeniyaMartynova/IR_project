The Venezuelan Navy has 2 out of 6 ships originally ordered, and Portugal, Algeria, and Indonesia each have 2 ships of this design. In the Portuguese navy, these ships are referred as patrol boats. In the 1950s Venezuelan Navy, the ships were classified as DLV (Destroyer Light Vessel) or light destroyers, in the 1980s were reclassified as ASW frigate, and are currently classified as coast guard vessels.

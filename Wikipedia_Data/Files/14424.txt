Title: List of Mil Mi-24 variants
Aspects: {'V24'}

The Soviet and later Russian Mil Mi-24 helicopter has been produced in many variants, as described below.


== History ==
In 1966, Soviet aircraft designer Mikhail Mil created a mock-up design of a new helicopter (derived from the Mil Mi-8) which was made with the intent of fulfilling both the role of a close air support aircraft as well as being able to transport infantry into combat. This prototype design was designated the V-24, and in 1968 a directive was given to proceed with the development of the helicopter.
The Mi-24 went from the drawing board to the first test-flights in less than eighteen months, with the first models being delivered to the Soviet Armed Forces for evaluation in 1971. As a result of the speedy development, the initial Mi-24 variants had a number of problems: lateral roll, weapon sighting issues, and a limited field of view for the pilot. A later redesign of the Mi-24's front section solved most of these problems.


== List of variants ==
A-10
Designation given to the aircraft used for record breaking from 1975 in the FAI E1 class.
V-24
The first version, twelve prototypes and development aircraft. The first V-24 mockup resembled the Bell UH-1A Huey.  Later models resembled the future Hind-A, one of which was modified in 1975 as A-10 for speed record attempts with wings removed and faired over and with inertia-type dampers on the main rotor head. The A-10 reached a speed of 368 km/h. It was armed with the GSh-23 autocannon and could carry up to six missiles or rockets.
Mi-24
(Hind-A) An early version of the Mi-24, which could carry eight combat troops and three crew members. It could also carry four 57mm rocket pods on four underwing pylons, four MCLOS 9M17 Fleyta (AT-2 Swatter) anti-tank missiles on two underwing rails, free-fall bombs, plus one Afanasev A-12.7 12.7mm machine-gun in the nose. The Mi-24A was the first production model.
Mi-24B
(Hind-A) Experimental variant of the Hind-A, one of which was used to test the Fenestron tail rotor.
Mi-24F
(Hind-A) Modified Hind-A with seven reinforcing ribs on the port fuselage aft of the wing and the SRO-2M Khrom ("Odd Rods") IFF antenna relocated from the canopy to the oil cooler. The APU exhaust was also extended and angled downwards. The designation may be unofficial.
Mi-24A
(Hind-B) The Mi-24A was the second production model. Both the Mi-24 and Mi-24A entered into Soviet Air Forces service in 1972. It lacked the four-barrel Yak-B 12.7mm machine gun under the nose.
Mi-24U
(Hind-C) Training version without nose gun and wingtip stations.
Mi-24BMT
Small number of Mi-24s converted into minesweepers.
Mi-24D (Hind-D)
The Mi-24D was designed to be a more pure gunship than the earlier variants. It entered production in 1973. The Mi-24D has a redesigned forward fuselage, with two separate cockpits for the pilot and gunner. It is armed with a single 12.7mm four-barrel Yak-B machine-gun under the nose. It can also carry four 57mm rocket pods, four SACLOS 9M17 Phalanga anti-tank missiles (a significant enhancement compared to the MCLOS system found on the Mi-24A), plus bombs and other weapons. One Mi-24D was sold to Poland in January 1996 and was used by the WTD 61 in Manching during 1994 for tests with the head of a MIM-23 Hawk missile in place of the chin-mounted gun. This version also had an unidentified modification in the rear cabin window on the starboard side.
Mi-24PTRK
Modification of the Mi-24D that was used for testing the Shturm V missile system for the Mi-24V.
Mi-24DU
A small number of Mi-24Ds were built as training helicopters with doubled controls.
Mi-24V
(Hind-E) Later development which entered production in 1976. It was armed with the more advanced 9M114 Shturm (AT-6 Spiral). Eight of these missiles are mounted on four outer wing pylons. It was the most widely produced version with more than 1,500 made. In Polish service this aircraft is designated Mi-24W. One Mi-24V was referred to as Mi-24T for unknown reasons.

Experimental Mi-24P to test abilities for recovery of downed aircraft.
Mi-24VP
(Hind-E Mod) Development of Mi-24V made in 1985 which replaced the machine-gun with twin 23mm autocannons in a movable turret. Entered service in 1989, but only 25 were made before production ended the same year. One Mi-24VP flew with the Delta-H tail rotor of the Mil Mi-28.
Mi-24VU
(Hind-E) Indian training version of Mi-24V.
Mi-24VD
A version produced in 1985 to test a rear defensive gun.

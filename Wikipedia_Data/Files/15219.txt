Title: Wabigoon Lake
Aspects: {'Wabigoon'}

Wabigoon Lake is a lake in Kenora District in northwestern Ontario, Canada. The community of Dryden (pop 8,198) is located on the north shore of the lake, and the primary inflow and outflow is the Wabigoon River. A dam built to provide power for the early pulp and paper company raised the original level of the lake by several feet and its current average depth is 19.6 feet (6.0 m), destroying a significant amount of the local timber and wild rice in the process.
The name "Wabigoon" comes from the Ojibwe waabigon, "marigold", or waabi-miigwan, "white feather".

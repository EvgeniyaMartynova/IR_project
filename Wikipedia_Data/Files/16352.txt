Title: Yugara
Aspects: {'Yagara'}

Jagera, also written Yagarr, Yaggera, Yuggera, Yugarabul and Yugaapul are the Australian Aboriginal people who are the Traditional Owners of the territories from Moreton Bay to Toowoomba including the city of Brisbane (including Ipswich). The Turrbal people are of roughly the same groups, but referring strictly speaking to a Jagera dialect.
This group is one of the traditional custodians of the land over which much of Brisbane is built.


== Language ==
Yaggera is classified as belonging to the Durubalic subgroup of the Pamaâ€“Nyungan languages, but is also treated as the general name for the languages of the Brisbane area of which Turrbal has historically been considered a dialect. The Australian English word 'yakka' (loosely meaning 'work', as in 'hard yakka') came from the Jagera language (yaga, 'strenuous work').The Yagara language was identified in Petrie on page 319 of his "Reminiscences" recorded by his daughter Constance, by the traditional language identifier, the word for "no". Their association with central Brisbane is established by the word for Brisbane, being recorded by Petrie as "Mianjin".
Mianjin is the spike of land from North Quay to Breakfast Creek, and was also known, as was the tribe there, as Miguntyun.
Ludwig Leichhardt's Diaries 1842-1843 on page 253 record Miguntyun as "Megandsin" as the name for the land holding area from Brisbane CBD to Breakfast Creek and the people who spoke the Yuggara Yugarabul language.


== Country ==
According to Watson, the Jagera-related peoples in the Chepara tribe inhabited the territories from Moreton Bay to Toowoomba to the west, nearly to Nanango in the north west, and encompassing Jimna and its surrounding forests, where their traditional lands adjoined those of the Waka Wakka and the Gubbi Gubbi (also Kabi Kabi or Gabi Gabi). Subgroups of the Chepara have identified with distinct areas including those concentrated in the Fassifern and Lockyer Creek areas. The Yugambeh and the Bundjalung people bordered them on the south. On 25 July 2017, the Full Federal Court decided on appeals of the Turrbal People and the Yugara People, rejecting both appeals and confirming the 2015 decision that native title does not exist in the greater Brisbane area.

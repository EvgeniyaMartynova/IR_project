Title: Pennsylvania Railroad class J28
Aspects: {'J28'}

The Pennsylvania Railroad's class J28 comprised 2 experimental 2-6-2 "Prairie" type steam locomotives.


== History ==
In 1905, the Pennsylvania Railroad needed a better steam locomotive, than the class E 4-4-2 "Atlantic" type. So, the railroad ordered two 2-6-2s from Alco-Schenectady. They were tested extensively and failed in railroad service. But, they were still on the roster in the late 1920s.


== Specifications ==
The two J28s had 80 inch drivers and a 34.25 foot engine wheelbase. Engine #7453 had inboard piston valves and Stephenson valve gear, while #2761 had outside piston valves and Walschaerts valve gear. They each weighed 377,500 pounds with the tender. They had 27,504 pounds of tractive effort. They had 89 square feet (8.3 m2) of firebox space. They had a grate area of 54 square feet (5.0 m2). They could hold 7,000 gallons of water and 13.5 tons of coal. Despite these specifications and more, the J28 was not a powerful enough Pennsylvania Railroad locomotive.

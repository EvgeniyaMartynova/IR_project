Title: Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List
Aspects: {'D-list'}

Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List is an American reality television series that aired on Bravo from August 3, 2005 to August 3, 2010. The series follows the struggle of self-proclaimed "D-list" celebrity Kathy Griffin to climb the Hollywood ladder. This often includes scheming for publicity with staffers Jessica, Tiffany, and Tom. Her relationships with her parents and her now ex-husband were also featured.
The series received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination every season during its six-season run and won the award twice.


== Production ==
Griffin had titled her first Bravo comedy special The D-List, to imply that her pull as a bottom-feeder celebrity was so low, she didn't even make the "C-list." The special was so popular that the network later approached Griffin to film a reality series based on her celebrity-bashing comedy.
All six seasons of the program were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program, with seasons 2 and 3 winning in 2007 and 2008. Season 3 premiered with the highest ratings for the show, with approximately one million viewers. Season 4 was the first expanded season, with ten episodes. Season 5 premiered with almost one million viewers, making it Bravo's highest rated Monday original series telecast ever in all demographics, at the time. The premiere was also up double digits among adults 18â€“49 versus the Season 4 premiere. Production began on Season 6, shooting eight episodes of the new season in January 2010. It began airing June 15, 2010, preceded by a new comedy special that was taped in Knoxville. The sixth and final season premiered on June 15, 2010 and concluded on August 3, 2010.
The series has aired on the cable TV channel Arena in Australia, E! in the UK, and in Canada on The Comedy Network and the Toronto-based independent station Sun TV.

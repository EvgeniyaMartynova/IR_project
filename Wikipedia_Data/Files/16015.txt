Title: Intel XDK
Aspects: {'XDK'}

Intel XDK was an Integrated Development Environment created by Intel to create native apps for mobile phones and tablets using web technologies like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Apps were created edited and simulated using the IDE then exported to AdobeÂ® PhoneGap or Cordova CLI for compilation into a native code app. The IDE allowed a developer to target the same solution to different platforms, thus reducing the amount of code required to ship a cross-platform product.  The XDK was first launched in October 2013.
XDK has been re-purposed by Intel for IoT development, and core mobile development features have been deprecated by Intel and are no longer supported. The accompanying cross-platform Cordova cloud build service has been taken offline.
It is not recommended to use XDK for new phone/tablet app development projects.
It may be of some interest for IoT developers.

Title: William Oscar Smith
Aspects: {'W.O. Smith'}

Dr. William Oscar (W.O.) Smith (May 2, 1917 â€“ May 31, 1991), was a jazz double bassist and music educator.  Although he never pursued a solo career, and, as a result, is not often remembered by jazz historians, Smith was an important player in early jazz history as a sideman.  Most notably, Smith was the bassist on Coleman Hawkins' iconic 1939 recording of "Body and Soul".  The great jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie said of Smith, "Of all the musicians I've had the pleasure of associating with, I can say that Oscar Smith was among the most gifted.  His timing and resolution were almost perfect.  He helped me discover my own sense of harmony and rhythm." Gillespie describes him as a sideman extraordinaire.

Smith and Gillespie started out in music together, playing for the Frankie Fairfax Band until 1937, when Gillespie moved away.After attending Mastbaum Vocational School of Music and graduating from Lincoln University in 1937, Smith made his way to New York City to enroll at New York University (NYU).

In his memoir, Smith remembered his life as that of "a witness, an anonymous witness. A sideman along for the ride.  A witness to the birth and growth of jazz as an American art form.  A witness to the unfolding drama of the civil rights movement."   As he put it, "It has been long and interesting gig for me."

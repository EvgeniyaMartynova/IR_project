== History ==
The station was originally AOR WSYR-FM ("94 Rock") until 1983 when it switched to its current format, where it enjoyed a long and successful run.  The format change was quite a surprise as WSYR-FM was one of the top rated stations in Syracuse, in fact the first FM station to achieve double digit ratings. 
In 2007, the station somewhat tweaked the format, playing more soft rock and pop hits from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s rather than mostly contemporary music. This was to distance itself from its former sister hot AC station, WWDG (105.1), which was sold off to new owners in 2009. (As of now, 105.1 is part of the religious Family Life Network.)
During the holiday season, from approximately the Friday before Thanksgiving (occasionally, the date of changeover is tied to a contest) through New Year's Day, WYYY changes format to all Christmas music.

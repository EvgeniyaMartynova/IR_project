Title: Methionine-S-oxide reductase
Aspects: {'L-methionine:oxidized-thioredoxin S-oxidoreductase'}

Methionine-S-oxide reductase (EC 1.8.4.5, methyl sulfoxide reductase I and II, acetylmethionine sulfoxide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, L-methionine:oxidized-thioredoxin S-oxidoreductase) is an enzyme with systematic name L-methionine:thioredoxin-disulfide S-oxidoreductase. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

L-methionine + thioredoxin disulfide + H2O 
  
    
      
        â‡Œ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
   L-methionine S-oxide + thioredoxinIn the reverse reaction, dithiothreitol can replace reduced thioredoxin.

== Critical reception ==
Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating:

'Can't Say No' is more than likely to set the Brighton-born lad down a similar path [as Justin Bieber]. "Some girls are naughty, some girls are sweet/ One thing they got in common, they all got a hold on me," he croons over buzzing bass and crisp beats, before things tumble into an ear-grabbing chorus bouncier than an inflatable castle. In fact, the final result is much the same; it's playful, fun and immediately leaves you wanting another go. .

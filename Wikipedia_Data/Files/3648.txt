Title: Fokker F-10
Aspects: {'F10'}

The Fokker F-10 was an enlarged development of the Fokker F.VII airliner, built in the late 1920s by the Fokker Aircraft Corporation of America. It carried 12 passengers, four more than the F.VII, and had a larger wing and more powerful engines.


== Operational history ==
Fokker built 65 for commercial and military service. After the crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air F-10 in 1931, which was caused by the deterioration of the wooden wing spar, the type was temporarily grounded, and it was required to undergo more frequent and rigorous inspection. Its public image was also greatly damaged, leading to its early retirement from U.S. airlines.

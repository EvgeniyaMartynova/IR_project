Note: This article lists the episodes in their DVD release order, rather than by their original air dates, because the original air dates were severely out of their production order.


=== Season 1 (1992–1993) ===
65 episodes were produced for Season One, due to it being the minimum number of episodes necessary for a TV series to be successfully syndicated. 60 of these episodes were initially aired during the 1992–1993 television season, which ran from September 1992 to May 1993. The final five episodes of Season One were held back until September 1993.
Episodes 1 to 28 were released on DVD in the Batman: The Animated Series Volume One set; episodes 29 to 56 in the Volume Two set; and episodes 57 to 65 in the Volume Three set.


=== Season 2 (1994–1995) ===
Because of the success the show was enjoying, while the 65 episodes of the first season were still airing, the Fox network executives ordered a second season of 20 more episodes. Season Two featured Robin more prominently, and nine out of the 20 episodes were given the onscreen title The Adventures of Batman & Robin.
After airing five of the 20 episodes in May 1994, the network reduced the series to airing only weekly on Saturday mornings. Ten more episodes were broadcast in this format in September–November 1994 under the Adventures of Batman & Robin title. Once these fifteen episodes had premiered (the final five were held back until September 1995), the weekday slot was restored to include reruns of the entire series, with all previous episodes being shown under the new title for all remaining airings on Fox, as well as several VHS releases.
The entirety of Season Two was released on DVD as part of the Batman: The Animated Series Volume Three set alongside the final nine episodes of Season One.

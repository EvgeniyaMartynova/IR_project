Title: Manilkara spectabilis
Aspects: {'M. spectabilis'}

Manilkara spectabilis, or bully tree (not to be confused with other trees with the same common name), is a little-understood, critically endangered species of tree in the sapodilla family. It has only ever been collected for botanical study once, from a single site near Lim√≥n in the Atlantic coastal forests of Costa Rica. It is believed to be endemic to this lowland region, the rainforests of which, though once unbroken, are now honeycombed by ongoing logging operations.

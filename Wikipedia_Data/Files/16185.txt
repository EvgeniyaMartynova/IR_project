On the eighth day of the war, the force set out to locate Egyptian forces that had landed in helicopters in the deployment area to cross the Suez Canal. Katz suffered a serious injury to his left thigh as a result of the impact of an RPG rocket on his APC, and was severely wounded.It was during that period that he met his future wife Tami, a sociology student at Bar-Ilan University, who had volunteered to work in Beilinson Hospital helping nurse the worst wounded.

After six months in hospital, he returned, on crutches, to study four more years in Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav, under the tutelage of Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook and Mazkir Bnei Akiva Shlomo Aviner. In 1977, he joined the group that  established the Beit El settlement in the West Bank. In 1978, Katz, together with his Rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed, split with the Beit El group and founded a new settlement which was called Beit El B. Katz was one of the original members of the Gush Emunim movement.

With the election of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1977, Katz, with wife and children, were among the first ten families to establish the Israeli settlement of Beit El in the northern Judean Hills surrounding Jerusalem. Katz founded the Beit-El Yeshiva Center, an educational center comprising myriad institutions with over 1,200 students: the Beit El Yeshiva and Kollel, Teachers' College, Har Brakha Hesder Yeshiva, Bnei Tzvi Yeshiva High School, Ra'aya Academy for Young Women (high school), Beit El Pre-Military Academy, as well as Arutz Sheva.

Katz was involved in the absorption of olim from the former Soviet Union, and was responsible for building more than 35,000 housing units in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights. These houses doubled the Jewish population beyond the Green Line.

In 1987, Katz bought an oceangoing vessel upon which to set up a radio station, Arutz Sheva (Channel 7), as an alternative station with a national religious orientation. The station never received a license to broadcast. After the station was shut down, in 2002, he founded the weekly Israeli newspaper BeSheva.

Title: European route E27
Aspects: {'E27'}

The European route E 27 is a road in Europe, part of the United Nations International E-road network, running from Belfort, France to Aosta, Italy.   Between these two cities, most of the route passes through French-speaking Switzerland, including a section along the eastern shore of the Lake Geneva, and a mountain section that peaks at just above 1,900 metres in the Great St Bernard Tunnel.
Much of the route has not currently been upgraded to autoroute quality.   However, major improvements in recent years have occurred in the region of the Franco-Swiss frontier and on the continuation to Delémont, with further extension of the motorway section south of Delémont ongoing.   Progress is slow because of the mountainous terrain.
Apart from the Swiss capital, Bern, the towns and cities linked by the E 27 tend to be medium sized or smaller.   Much of route is dominated by mountainous landscapes, with a correspondingly high profile tourist trade:  mountain valley agriculture or viticulture are also in evidence where the topography permits.   Several sections of the E 27 are more than averagely occupied by tunnels and viaducts.

== History ==
The F-Factor brand was created by New York dietitian and author Tanya Zuckerbrot. She developed the plan after gaining 24 pounds and deciding to start eating like she was teaching her clients. Her diet consisted of high-fiber carbs and lean protein which became the base for The F-Factor Diet plan. In 2006, she released the book The F-Factor Diet which outlined the diet plan, and expanded her private practice in New York a year later.In 2011, F-Factor foods began being served in restaurants. The F-Factor Diet was endorsed by Megyn Kelly in her 2016 autobiography Settle for More, saying she used it after giving birth to take off the baby weight gain.


== Overview ==
The F-Factor Diet incorporates four principles which include eating fiber-rich carbohydrates, dining out, social drinking, and working out less.  It advocates using lean proteins with high-fiber carbohydrates.  The plan focuses on curbing the feelings of hunger and deprivation commonly associated with dieting. The "F" stands for fiber which is a non-digestible part of carbohydrates and helps people feel full. The F-Factor Diet does not require users to cut out fat, carbs, or alcohol.F-Factor also provides nutritional counseling services to users including in-office, mobile app, and phone consults. It also has its own brand of food and recipes. In 2018, it launched its own line of all-natural fiber-rich products.

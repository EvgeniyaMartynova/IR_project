Title: Tumansky R-15
Aspects: {'R15'}

The Tumansky R-15 is an axial flow, single shaft turbojet with an afterburner. Its best known use is on the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25.


== Design and development ==
The R-15-300 was designed at OKB-300 design bureau led by Sergei Tumansky in the late 1950s. The engine was originally designed to be used in the Tupolev Tu-121 high-altitude high-speed cruise missile. Due to lacking Soviet resources and funding the engine casing was mainly steel, and in areas exposed to high levels of heat, 30 micrometre silver-plated steel. At the time, the USSR did not have the resources to exploit metals such as titanium, or other composite alloys, which could have greatly reduced the engine's weight. The Tu-121 effort was later canceled, but its basic design was re-used to create the Tupolev Tu-123 reconnaissance drone.


=== Performance ===
At dry thrust the engine could produce 7,500 kilograms force (73.5 kN, 16,500 lbf); with afterburner the output is 11,200 kilograms force (110 kN, 24,700 lbf). This allowed speeds of up to mach 3.2 in the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 (which used two engines). However, should the aircraft ever travel at these speeds, the engines would have to be scrapped. The engine had very high fuel consumption, especially at low altitudes.


== Variants ==
R-15-300:  Original version. Used in Tupolev Tu-123 Yastreb drone.
R-15-300M
R-15B-300: Electronic engine controls (the first for the Soviet engine). and modifications to increase life span. Original engine for the MiG-25P, MiG-25R and variants. Life expectancy 150 hours.
R-15BD-300: Improved and more powerful version for MiG-25PD and MiG-25PDS. Life expectancy increased to 1000 hours.
R-15BF2-300: Uprated version. Used in Ye-266M high-performance MiG-25M prototype. MiG-25M aircraft was never put into production


== Applications ==
Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25
Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-150 family
Tupolev Tu-121
Tupolev Tu-123

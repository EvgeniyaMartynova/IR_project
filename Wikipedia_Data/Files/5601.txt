Aspects: {'I Can See Your Voice (disambiguation)'}

I Can See Your Voice is a Philippine television mystery music game show broadcast by ABS-CBN. It is the Philippine version of the South Korean game show of the same name.


== Gameplay ==
The guest artist(s) must guess six SEE-cret songers who are "SEE-ngers" and "SEE-ntunados" without hearing them singing. They will give their advice to them with a group of panelists called SING-vestigators.
After eliminating one to two SEE-cret songers in each round, they will perform in the Stage of Truth. The last remaining SEE-cret Songer (s) standing will be able to duet-perform together with guest artist(s).
For non-winning SEE-cret songers, each round gets a consolation prizes ranged at one ₱5,000 (for the 1st round); two ₱10,000 each (for the 2nd round); and two ₱15,000 each (for the 3rd round). The winning SEE-cret songer also gets ₱25,000 (and an invitation as official contender to Tawag ng Tanghalan, which was later abolished in the 2nd season).


== Broadcast ==
I Can See Your Voice airs every Weekends nights on ABS-CBN's Yes Weekend! programming block. However, for season 2, the show only airs on Saturdays.
The show does not air on Black Saturday during Holy Week. On every second or third weekend of December, the show would be pre-empted to give way for the telecast of the annual ABS-CBN Christmas Special.


== Rounds ==
There are six individuals or a group of mystery singers (referred to as SEE-cret Songers) standing on a platform with their own aliases to keep them secret and they don't speak until the initial performance.

Stop, Looks, and Listen (season 1)The guest artist(s) have time to observe and examine each SEE-cret Songer based on their appearance. After this, they will play a muted video of each SEE-cret Songer that reveals only 0.3 seconds of their singing voice as an additional hint.
The Voice is Synching (season 1–)Every SEE-cret songer performs a lip-sync of a song. SEE-ngers lip-sync to their own voice, while SEE-ntunados lip-sync to other's voices.
Sync Zoned (season 1, Sharon Cuneta episode)They must perform lip-sync with a non-lyrical part of a song (i.e. screaming, whistling, or interjective words.)

I Like to Prove It! Prove It! (season 1)They will provide proofs of each SEE-cret Songer's singing ability (i.e. photo, video, certificates, etc.) SEE-ngers have their own evidences, while SEE-ntunados have their evidences fabricated.
Let's Play It by Hear (season 1–)For 15 seconds, three randomly selected panelists must hear the SEE-cret songer's singing voice using a headphone. Afterwards, he or she must defend the SEE-cret songer and convince the guest artist(s) to choose him/her as the final SEE-cret songer.
Two or False (season 2–)Each SEE-cret songer is given two different identities – as a SEE-nger and as a SEE-ntunado, but only one of them is their real identity.

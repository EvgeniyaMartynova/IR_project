Aspects: {'H. aspera'}

Hydrangea aspera is a species of flowering plant in the family Hydrangaceae, native to the region between the Himalayas, across southern China, to Taiwan. It is a large, erect deciduous shrub growing to 3 m (10 ft) tall and wide, with broadly oval leaves. The flowers are typically borne in large flat heads in late summer, and are in variable shades of pale blue and pink, fringed by white or pale pink sterile florets.The Latin aspera means "rough-textured" and refers to the downy lower surface of the leaves.
Considerable natural variation occurs in the species, some of which are sometimes considered to be separate species; these include H. aspera ssp. sargentiana and H. aspera ssp. villosa.

McCoy joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary on leaving school and was a serving officer during the Troubles. He initially served in Dungannon as a community officer. However he was subsequently transferred to Bangor. In a 2012 Irish Examiner interview with his former Ireland teammate, Donal Lenihan, McCoy says he was moved after the RUC received a warning of a threat to his life. McCoy denied receiving a bullet in the post from the IRA. When travelling to Dublin to play for Ireland, McCoy was escorted by Garda Síochána Special Branch officers.

Title: Lankford coefficient
Aspects: {'R-value'}

The Lankford coefficient (also called Lankford value, R-value, or plastic strain ratio) is a measure of the plastic anisotropy of a rolled sheet metal.  This scalar quantity is used extensively as an indicator of the formability of recrystallized low-carbon steel sheets.

If

    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are the coordinate directions in the plane of rolling and 
  
    
      
        z

    {\displaystyle R={\cfrac {\epsilon _{\mathrm {xy} }^{p}}{\epsilon _{\mathrm {z} }^{p}}}}
  where

    {\displaystyle \epsilon _{\mathrm {xy} }^{p}}

    {\displaystyle \epsilon _{\mathrm {z} }^{p}}
   is the plastic strain through-the-thickness.
More recent studies have shown that the R-value of a material can depend strongly on the strain even at small strains .  In practice, the 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   value is usually measured at 20% elongation in a tensile test.
For sheet metals, the 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   values are usually determined for three different directions of loading in-plane (
  
    
      
        
          0
          
            ∘
          
        
        ,
        
          45
          
            ∘

    {\displaystyle 0^{\circ },45^{\circ },90^{\circ }}
   to the rolling direction) and the normal R-value is taken to be the average 

  
    
      
        R

== Anisotropy of steel sheets ==
Generally, the Lankford value of cold rolled steel sheet acting for deep-drawability shows heavy orientation, and such deep-drawability is characterized by 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  .  However, in the actual press-working, the deep-drawability of steel sheets cannot be determined only by the value of 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   and the measure of planar anisotropy, 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{p}}
   is more appropriate.
In an ordinary cold rolled steel, 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            90
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{90}}
   is the highest, and 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            45
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{45}}
   is the lowest.  Experience shows that even if 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            45
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{45}}
   is close to 1, 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            90
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{90}}
   can be quite high leading to a high  average value of 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  .  In such cases, any press-forming process design on the basis of 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            45
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{45}}
   does not lead to an improvement in deep-drawability.

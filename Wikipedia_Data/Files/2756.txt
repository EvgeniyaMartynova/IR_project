Title: HP Photosmart
Aspects: {'E series'}

Hewlett-Packard's line of digital cameras is called PhotoSmart
The company also makes a line of consumer-based photo printers under the same branding.


== Digital cameras ==
The original HP digital camera was an Intel Miniature card-based model simply called the Photosmart.  It was a VGA-resolution camera with a simple LCD.
The company later broadened its line with a number of series of cameras, all using the Photosmart name.
HP announced on November 7th, 2007 that it will seek an alternative business model for its HP-branded cameras and was working to identify an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partner that would be licensed to design, source and distribute digital cameras under the HP brand.

Title: List of Intel chipsets
Aspects: {'X38'}

This article provides a list of motherboard chipsets made by Intel, divided into three main categories: those that use the PCI bus for interconnection (the 4xx series), those that connect using specialized "hub links" (the 8xx series), and those that connect using PCI Express (the 9xx series). The chipsets are listed in chronological order.


== Pre-chipset situation ==
Early IBM XT-compatible mainboards did not have a chipset yet, but relied instead on a collection of discrete TTL chips by Intel:
the 8284 clock generator
the 8288 bus controller
the 8254 Programmable Interval Timer
the 8255 parallel I/O interface
the 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller
the 8237 DMA controller


== Early chipsets ==
To integrate the functions needed on a mainboard into a smaller amount of ICs, Intel licensed the ZyMOS POACH chipset for its Intel 80286 and Intel 80386SX processors (the 82230/82231 High Integration AT-Compatible Chip Set). This chipset can be used with an 82335 High-integration Interface Device to provide support for the Intel 386SX.List of early Intel chipset includes:
82091AA EISA/ISA - Advanced Integrated Peripheral (AIP), includes: floppy disk controller, 2× UARTs, parallel port, IDE controller, oscillator, etc.
82310 MCA - announced in April 1988. Includes: 82306 Local Channel Support Chip, 82307 DMA Controller/Central Arbiter, 82308 Micro Channel Bus Controller, 82309 Address Bus Controller, 82706 VGA Graphics Controller.
82350 EISA - announced in September 1988.
82311 MCA - announced in November 1988. Includes: 82303 and 82304 Local I/O Channel Support Chips, 82307 DMA Controller/Central Arbiter, 82308 Micro Channel Bus Controller, 82309 Address Bus Controller, 82706 VGA Graphics Controller, 82077 Floppy Disk Controller.
82320 MCA - announced in April 1989.
82340SX PC AT - announced in January 1990, it is the Topcat chipset licensed from VLSI.
82340DX PC AT - announced in January 1990, it is the Topcat chipset licensed from VLSI.
82360SL - announced in October 1990. It was a chipset for the mobile 80386SL and 80486SL processors. It integrated DMA controller, an interrupt controller PIC, serial and parallel ports, and power-management logic for the processor.
82350DT EISA - announced in April 1991.

Replaces AGP and CSA with PCI Express, and also supports "Matrix RAID", a RAID mode designed to allow the usage of RAID levels 0 and 1 simultaneously with two hard drives. (Normally RAID1+0 would have required four hard drives)

[*] Remapping of PCIE/APIC memory ranges not supported, some physical memory might not be accessible (e.g. limited to 3.5 GB or similar). Operational configuration is 4 ranks - 2× 2 GB dual rank modules or 4× 1 GB single rank modules - depends on number of motherboard DDR2 slots.

Sub-versions:
Q43 - Q45 without vPro support. Also lacks Intel Trusted Platform Module 1.2 support.
B43 - Q43 with an ICH10D South Bridge.[1] The 975X chipset supports only ×16 PCI Express (electrically) in the top slot when the slot below it is unpopulated. Otherwise it and the lower slot (both attached to the Memory Controller Hub) operate at ×8 electrically.
[2] Officially 975X supports a maximum of 1066 MT/s FSB. Unofficially, third-party motherboards (Asus, Gigabyte) support certain 1333FSB 45 nm Core2 processors, usually with later BIOS updates.
[3] The 975X chipset technical specification shows only DDR2-533/667 memory support. Actual implementations of 975X do support DDR2 800.
[4] VT-d is inherently supported on these chipsets, but may not be enabled by individual OEMs. Always read the motherboard manual and check for BIOS updates. X38/X48 VT-d support is limited to certain Intel, Supermicro, DFI (LanParty) and Tyan boards. VT-d is broken or non existent on some boards until the BIOS is updated. Note that VT-d is a chipset Memory Controller Hub technology, not a processor feature, but this is complicated by later processor generations (Core i3/i5/i7) moving the MCH from the motherboard to the processor package, making only certain I series CPUs support VT-d.


=== Core 2 mobile chipsets ===
1 Unofficially this chipset support 5GB.
2 Officially only 4GB is supported. Unofficially many laptops with this chipset support 8GB.
3 Low power mode, HD playback mode and Full performance mode respectively.


=== Southbridge 9xx and 3/4 Series chipsets ===


== 5/6/7/8/9 Series chipsets ==
The Nehalem microarchitecture moves the memory controller into the processor. For high-end Nehalem processors, the X58 IOH acts as a bridge from the QPI to PCI Express peripherals and DMI to the ICH10 southbridge. For mainstream and lower-end Nehalem processors, the integrated memory controller (IMC) is an entire northbridge (some even having GPUs), and the PCH (Platform Controller Hub) acts as a southbridge.
Not listed below is the 3450 chipset (see Xeon chipsets) which is compatible with Nehalem mainstream and high-end processors but does not claim core iX-compatibility. With either a Core i5 or i3 processor, the 3400-series chipsets enable the ECC functionality of unbuffered ECC memory. Otherwise these chipsets do not enable unbuffered ECC functionality.
The Cougar Point Intel 6 series chipsets with stepping B2 were recalled due to a hardware bug that causes their 3 Gbit/s Serial ATA to degrade over time until they become unusable. Stepping B3 of the Intel 6 series chipsets will have the fix for this. The Z68 chipset which supports CPU overclocking and use of the integrated graphics does not have this hardware bug, however all other ones with B2 did. The Z68 also added support for transparently caching hard disk data on to solid-state drives (up to 64 GB), a technology called Smart Response Technology.


=== LGA 1156 ===

Chipsets supporting LGA 1156 CPUs (Lynnfield and Clarkdale).


=== LGA 1155 ===

Chipsets supporting LGA 1155 CPUs (Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge). The PCIe 2.0 lanes from the PCH ran at 5 GT/s in this series, unlike in the previous LGA 1156 chips.
1 For Sandy Bridge mainstream desktop and business platforms. Sandy Bridge CPUs provide 16 PCIe 2.0 lanes for direct GPU connectivity.
2 For Ivy Bridge mainstream desktop platform. Ivy Bridge CPUs provide 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes for direct GPU connectivity and additional 4 PCIe 2.0 lanes.


=== LGA 1150 ===

Chipsets that support LGA 1150 CPUs are listed below.  Haswell and Haswell Refresh CPUs are supported by all listed chipsets; however, a BIOS update is usually required for 8-Series Lynx Point motherboards to support Haswell Refresh CPUs.  Broadwell CPUs are supported only by 9-Series chipsets, which are usually referred to as Wildcat Point.The C1 stepping of the Lynx Point chipset contains a bug –  a system could lose connectivity with USB devices plugged into USB 3.0 ports provided by the chipset if the system enters the S3 sleep mode.


=== LGA 1366, LGA 2011, and LGA 2011-v3 ===
Single socket chipsets supporting LGA 1366, LGA 2011, and LGA 2011-v3 CPUs. Please consult List of Intel Xeon chipsets for further, multi-socket, chipsets for these sockets.

1 X58 South Bridge is ICH10/ICH10R.
2 X58 TDP includes the X58 IOH TDP in addition to the ICH10/ICH10R TDP.
3 For Sandy Bridge enthusiast desktop platform. Sandy Bridge CPUs will provide up to 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes for direct GPU connectivity and additional 4 PCIe 2.0 lanes. NOTE : This reference number 4 is on X79, which is a Sandy bridge -E, not Sandy Bridge, and PCIe 3.0 only is enabled when an Ivy Bridge-E CPU or Xeon E-5 series is used.
4 For Haswell enthusiast desktop platform. Haswell CPUs will provide up to 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes for direct GPU connectivity and additional 4 PCIe 2.0 lanes.


=== Mobile chipsets ===
All Core-i series mobile chipsets have an integrated south bridge.


== 100/200/300 Series chipsets ==
All support Intel VT-d and do not support PCI.


=== LGA 1151 rev 1 ===

The 100 Series chipsets (codenamed Sunrise Point), for Skylake processors using the LGA 1151 socket, were released in the third quarter of 2015.The 200 Series chipsets (codenamed Union Point) were introduced along with Kaby Lake processors, which also use the LGA 1151 socket; these were released in the first quarter of 2017.


=== LGA 1151 rev 2 ===

While Coffee Lake shares the same socket as Skylake and Kaby Lake, this revision of LGA 1151 is electrically incompatible with 100 and 200 series CPUs.
The 300 Series chipsets were introduced along with Coffee Lake processors, which use the LGA 1151 socket; the enthusiast model was released in the last quarter of 2017, the rest of the line will be released in 2018.


==== Xeon chipsets ====
Chipset C232 does not support CPU integrated GPUs.


=== LGA 2066 ===

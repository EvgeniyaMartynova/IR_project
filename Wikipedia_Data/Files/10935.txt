Title: Q-Pochhammer symbol
Aspects: {'Q series'}

In mathematics, in the area of combinatorics, a q-Pochhammer symbol, also called a q-shifted factorial, is a q-analog of the Pochhammer symbol. It is defined as

  
    
      
        (
        a
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          ∏
          
            k
            =
            0
          
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        1
        −
        a
        
          q
          
            k
          
        
        )
        =
        (
        1
        −
        a
        )
        (
        1
        −
        a
        q
        )
        (
        1
        −
        a
        
          q
          
            2
          
        
        )
        ⋯
        (
        1
        −
        a
        
          q
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a;q)_{n}=\prod _{k=0}^{n-1}(1-aq^{k})=(1-a)(1-aq)(1-aq^{2})\cdots (1-aq^{n-1})}
  with

  
    
      
        (
        a
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            0
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a;q)_{0}=1}
  by definition. The q-Pochhammer symbol is a major building block in the construction of q-analogs; for instance, in the theory of basic hypergeometric series, it plays the role that the ordinary Pochhammer symbol plays in the theory of generalized hypergeometric series.
Unlike the ordinary Pochhammer symbol, the q-Pochhammer symbol can be extended to an infinite product:

  
    
      
        (
        a
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            ∞
          
        
        =
        
          ∏
          
            k
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        (
        1
        −
        a
        
          q
          
            k
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a;q)_{\infty }=\prod _{k=0}^{\infty }(1-aq^{k}).}
  This is an analytic function of q in the interior of the unit disk, and can also be considered as a formal power series in q.  The special case

  
    
      
        ϕ
        (
        q
        )
        =
        (
        q
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            ∞
          
        
        =
        
          ∏
          
            k
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        (
        1
        −
        
          q
          
            k
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi (q)=(q;q)_{\infty }=\prod _{k=1}^{\infty }(1-q^{k})}
  is known as Euler's function, and is important in combinatorics, number theory, and the theory of modular forms.

The finite product can be expressed in terms of the infinite product:

  
    
      
        (
        a
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              (
              a
              ;
              q
              
                )
                
                  ∞

              a
              
                q
                
                  n

                )
                
                  ∞

    {\displaystyle (a;q)_{n}={\frac {(a;q)_{\infty }}{(aq^{n};q)_{\infty }}},}

The q-Pochhammer symbol is the subject of a number of q-series identities, particularly the infinite series expansions

    {\displaystyle (-a;q)_{\infty }=\prod _{k=0}^{\infty }(1+aq^{k})}
  is the number of partitions of m into n or n-1 distinct parts.
By removing a triangular partition with n − 1 parts from such a partition, we are left with an arbitrary partition with at most n parts. This gives a weight-preserving bijection between the set of partitions into n or n − 1 distinct parts and the set of pairs consisting of a triangular partition having n − 1 parts and a partition with at most n parts. By identifying generating series, this leads to the identity:

                n
              
            
            
              (
              q
              ;
              q
              
                )
                
                  n
                
              
            
          
        
        =
        
          ∑
          
            n

            0

                  n
                  
                    2
                  
                
              
            
            
              (
              q
              ;
              q
              
                )
                
                  n
                
                
                  2
                
              
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{(q;q)_{\infty }}}=\sum _{n\geq 0}p(n)q^{n}=\sum _{n\geq 0}{\frac {q^{n}}{(q;q)_{n}}}=\sum _{n\geq 0}{\frac {q^{n^{2}}}{(q;q)_{n}^{2}}}.}
  The q-binomial theorem itself can also be handled by a slightly more involved combinatorial argument of a similar flavor (see also the expansions given in the next subsection) .


== Multiple arguments convention ==
Since identities involving q-Pochhammer symbols so frequently involve products of many symbols, the standard convention is to write a product as a single symbol of multiple arguments:

  
    
      
        (
        
          a
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          a
          
            m
          
        
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
        =
        (
        
          a
          
            1
          
        
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
        (
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
        …
        (
        
          a
          
            m
          
        
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{m};q)_{n}=(a_{1};q)_{n}(a_{2};q)_{n}\ldots (a_{m};q)_{n}.}
  


== q-series ==
A q-series is a series in which the coefficients are functions of q, typically expressions of 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        ;
        q
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a;q)_{n}}
  . Early results are due to Euler, Gauss, and Cauchy. The systematic study begins with Eduard Heine (1843).


== Relationship to other q-functions ==
The q-analog of n, also known as the q-bracket or q-number of n, is defined to be

  
    
      
        [
        n
        
          ]
          
            q
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              1
              −
              
                q
                
                  n
                
              
            
            
              1
              −
              q
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle [n]_{q}={\frac {1-q^{n}}{1-q}}.}
  From this one can define the q-analog of the factorial, the q-factorial, as

These numbers are analogues in the sense that  

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            q
            →
            1
          
        
        
          
            
              1
              −
              
                q
                
                  n
                
              
            
            
              1
              −
              q
            
          
        
        =
        n
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{q\rightarrow 1}{\frac {1-q^{n}}{1-q}}=n,}
  and so also 

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            q
            →
            1
          
        
        [
        n
        ]
        
          !
          
            q
          
        
        =
        n
        !
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{q\rightarrow 1}[n]!_{q}=n!.}
  The limit value n! counts permutations of an n-element set S.  Equivalently, it counts the number of sequences of nested sets 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            1
          
        
        ⊂
        
          E
          
            2
          
        
        ⊂
        ⋯
        ⊂
        
          E
          
            n
          
        
        =
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{1}\subset E_{2}\subset \cdots \subset E_{n}=S}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{i}}
   contains exactly i elements.  By comparison, when q is a prime power and V is an n-dimensional vector space over the field with q elements, the q-analogue 
  
    
      
        [
        n
        ]
        
          !
          
            q
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle [n]!_{q}}
   is the number of complete flags in V, that is, it is the number of sequences 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            1
          
        
        ⊂
        
          V
          
            2
          
        
        ⊂
        ⋯
        ⊂
        
          V
          
            n
          
        
        =
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{1}\subset V_{2}\subset \cdots \subset V_{n}=V}
   of subspaces such that 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{i}}
   has dimension i.  The preceding considerations suggest that one can regard a sequence of nested sets as a flag over a conjectural field with one element.
A product of negative integer q-brackets can be expressed in terms of the q-factorial as

  
    
      
        
          ∏
          
            k
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        [
        −
        k
        
          ]
          
            q
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              (
              −
              1
              
                )
                
                  n
                
              
              
              [
              n
              ]
              
                !
                
                  q
                
              
            
            
              q
              
                n
                (
                n
                +
                1
                )
                
                  /
                
                2
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n}[-k]_{q}={\frac {(-1)^{n}\,[n]!_{q}}{q^{n(n+1)/2}}}}
  From the q-factorials, one can move on to define the q-binomial coefficients, also known as the Gaussian binomial coefficients, as

  
    
      
        
          
            
              [
              
                
                  
                    n
                  
                
                
                  
                    k
                  
                
              
              ]
            
          
          
            q
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              [
              n
              ]

              [
              n
              −
              k
              ]

                  q
                
              
              [
              k

                  q
                
              
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}n\\k\end{bmatrix}}_{q}={\frac {[n]!_{q}}{[n-k]!_{q}[k]!_{q}}},}
  where it is easy to see that the triangle of these coefficients is symmetric in the sense that

One also obtains a q-analog of the Gamma function, called the q-gamma function, and defined as

              −

                )
                
                  1
                  −
                  x

  This converges to the usual Gamma function as q approaches 1 from inside the unit disc. Note that

        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma _{q}(x+1)=[x]_{q}\Gamma _{q}(x)}
  for any x and

  
    
      
        
          Γ
          
            q
          
        
        (
        n

        1
        )
        =

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma _{q}(n+1)=[n]!_{q}.}
  for non-negative integer values of n. Alternatively, this may be taken as an extension of the q-factorial function to the real number system.

Title: Wacol railway station
Aspects: {'Wacol (disambiguation)'}

Wacol railway station is located on the Main line in Queensland, Australia. It serves the Brisbane suburb of Wacol. It is the last station on the Ipswich line located within Brisbane.


== History ==
The Wolston railway station was opened on 8 October 1874, taking its name from nearby Wolston House. However, the name caused confusion with the Wilston railway station, so it was renamed on  8 July 1927 to Wacol railway station. Wacol is a coined word from weigh coal, as the principal purpose of the station was coal handling.In 1998, the timber station building was replaced. In 2011, bright murals depicting domestic wildlife, forests and farmlands were painted on the walls of platforms buildings. The animal theme was chosen because the RSPCA Animal Care Campus moved to Wacol in December 2011.

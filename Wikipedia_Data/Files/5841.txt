"I Don't Wanna Live Forever", alternatively titled "I Don't Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker)", is a song recorded by English singer Zayn and American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift for the soundtrack to the 2017 film Fifty Shades Darker.

== Composition ==
"I Don't Wanna Live Forever" is an electro-R&B ballad. On the track, the pair trade "romantic overtures", while Zayn uses a falsetto on parts of the song, and Swift ponders what the relationship means."I Don't Wanna Live Forever" is written in the key of A minor and moves at a tempo of 118 beats per minute in common time.  The song follows a chord progression of F–C–G–Am–F–C–G–G♯dim–Am, and the vocals span two octaves, from E3 to E5.


== Critical reception ==
Nolan Feenery of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ rating: "Welcome to Taylor Swift's Sexy Side." He also praised the vocals of both artists. Lucas Villa of AXS thought the song was not as sexy as Ellie Goulding's "Love Me like You Do" or The Weeknd's "Earned It", writing, "Despite the neutered lyricism, Zayn saves the day and manages to maneuver his most magnificent performance to date."

=== Synopsis ===
The video starts with Malik emerging from his car on a rainy night as the paparazzi take photos. As Malik enters a hotel he starts singing his part and as the chorus begins he reaches the elevator with red lights and then pans over to another elevator with Swift singing her part and proceeds to her hotel room. Malik in his room sings the chorus and Swift pours some champagne in a glass. The rest of the video is Malik and Swift throwing objects like glasses, lamps, pillows across their rooms in anger with flashing blue and red lights. Malik and Swift are seen standing together facing backs and singing the chorus together (Malik singing the chorus and Swift lip-syncing) and looking at each other. The video ends with Swift on her bed singing the last part of the song.

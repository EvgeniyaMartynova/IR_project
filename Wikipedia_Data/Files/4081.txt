The current season is the 33rd edition of the event. 11 different teams have won the cup with 10-time champions South China being the most successful.
In the first three years, the semi-finals and the finals were two-legged event. If the aggregate result was drawn, there would be extra time after the second leg. Drawn ties after extra time would be settled by a replay. However, this practice was abandoned in 1977. Since 1978, all matches have become one-legged, draws are settled by extra time and penalty shootouts.
Moreover, teams from the Second Division and Third Division were allowed to enter the competition before. However, due to the huge difference in playing level between the First Division and the inferior levels below it, the cup has been limited to top-flight teams since 1981.The current HKFA Cup holders are Kitchee.

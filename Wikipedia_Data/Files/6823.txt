Aspects: {'Jabara'}

Jubur (Arabic: جبور‎), also known as Jebour, Jibour, Jubour, Jabur, Jaburi, Jebouri, and Jabara, is the largest Arab tribe in Iraq that scattered throughout central and northern Iraq. Part of the tribe settled in Hawija and Kirkuk in the eighteenth century. Al-Jiburi, along with the 'Azza, Dulaim, Janabi and Obaidi federations, are sub-groups of the Zubaydi tribe, which is one of the Yemeni Arab tribal groups of Iraq.

The Jubour were originally Sunni Muslims until the 19th century when some of them started to convert to Shia Islam, especially in the mid-Euphrates region of southern Iraq.


== Battles and wars ==
The Jubouri tribe has battled against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant since 2014 and retaken control of several cities and villages in North Iraq. In March 2015, Al Jubouri and the Iraqi Armed Forces were fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in the Second Battle of Tikrit (2015).

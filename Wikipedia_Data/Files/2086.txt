Title: Line D (Prague Metro)
Aspects: {'D Line'}

Line D (Czech: Linka D) is a proposed line of the Prague Metro, serving Prague 4 and Prague 12 in the south of the Czech capital. The first part of the chronologically fourth (blue) line in the system is planned to be built in 2019–2023.


== History ==
Construction of Line D connecting Náměstí Míru with Nové Dvory area was previously intended to start in 2010. An alternative was proposed in 2012, without building a transfer station at Pankrác, and instead sharing Line C between Nádraží Holešovice and Pankrác.The construction of the line was approved by the city of Prague in 2013, and was initially planned to be built between 2017 and 2022. The project involves 10.5 kilometres (6.5 mi) of track with 10 stations, connecting Náměstí Míru and Depo Písnice. The cost was estimated at least at 25 billion CZK, as of October 2013 the city of Prague has spent more than 500 million CZK on the project. In July 2015 it was decided that the line will be driverless.According to the current plan, the Pankrác – Olbrachtova section is to be built first, construction work should begin in 2019. Part of the route to Nové Dvory station should be completed by 2023. In addition to the phase from Pankrác to Písnice, second phase of Line D will also lead from Pankrác to Náměstí Míru.

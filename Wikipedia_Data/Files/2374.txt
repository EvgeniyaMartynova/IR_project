Title: Mexican agouti
Aspects: {'D. mexicana'}

The Mexican agouti (Dasyprocta mexicana), also known as the Mexican black agouti, is a species of rodent in the family Dasyproctidae. It is native to lowland evergreen forest and second growth in southern Mexico (Veracruz, Oaxaca, Chiapas and Tabasco), but has also been introduced to Cuba. This critically endangered species is threatened by habitat loss. Its overall blackish color separates it from the only other agouti found in Mexico, the Central American agouti.

Aspects: {'P. gracilis'}

Plasmodium gracilis is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium.
Like all Plasmodium species P. gracilis has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are reptiles.


== Description ==
The parasite was first described by Telford and Wellehan in 2005.Neither the schizonts nor the gametocytes have any effect upon dimensions of host erythrocytes or their nuclei.
The schizonts average 4.3 x 3.5 micrometres (range: 3.0 - 6.0 x 3.0 - 5.0) in size.
They produce on average 4.9 merozoites (range: 3.0 - 8.0) which are usually arranged as a fan.
The gametocytes average 5.9 x 5.5 micrometre (range: 5.0 - 6.6 x 5.0 - 6.0). The length x width product is  31.9 micrometre^2 (range: 25 - 40) and the length/width ratio is 1.06 (1.0 - 1.2).
The gametocytes are not sexually dimorphic in either size or shape.


== Geographical occurrence ==
This species is found in New Guinea.


== Clinical features and host pathology ==
This species infects the crocodile skink Tribolonotus gracilis.

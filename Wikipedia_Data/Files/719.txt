=== Production ===
Maroon 5 recorded over a dozen songs for their second studio album It Won't Be Soon Before Long. After finalizing the final track listing of the album, many songs were left out, including favorites of lead singer Adam Levine. While promoting the album in the United States and Mexico the group decided to release seven of the unreleased tracks to the public.
Label A&M/Octone spoke with Levine about releasing a deluxe version of It Won't Be Soon Before Long since sales were positive at that time. The studio had many meetings with iTunes and by the final week of November they decided to release seven tracks cut from It Won't Be Soon Before Long.


=== Release and promotion ===
The album was heavily promoted on the iTunes Store and official Apple website. The entire album was streamed on Apple Inc.'s website, beginning on December 12, 2007, a week before the album's North American release date.
After the main promotion for It Won't Be Soon Before Long and its singles, Maroon 5 released a music video for the track "Story" in 2009. The video was directed by Bob Carmichael and was mainly released to raise awareness for the Harlem Children's Zone. The music video is mainly an animated slideshow of Maroon 5 during the It Won't Be Soon Before Long Tour and its various stops.

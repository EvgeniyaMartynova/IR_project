"I Belong to You"/"How Many Ways" (known as "How Many Ways"/"I Belong to You" in the vinyl edition) is the fifth and final single from American singer Toni Braxton's eponymous debut studio album (1993). The single was released in the United States in 1994 with both songs as double-sided songs.
"I Belong to You" was written by Vassal Benford and Ronald Spearman and produced by Benford. While there was no music video for "I Belong to You", the song garnered Braxton a nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.
"How Many Ways" was co-written by Braxton herself and sampled the song "God Make Me Funky" by The Headhunters featuring Pointer Sisters. The protagonist of the composition, co-written by Braxton herself, declares there are many ways in which she loves her man. The music video for "How Many Ways" features Braxton and Shemar Moore riding in a car, frolicking in a playground, and on a veranda. A remix produced by R. Kelly also was released to radio and music television stations.
"I Belong to You/How Many Ways" peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100 on January 21, 1995.

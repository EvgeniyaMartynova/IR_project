Title: Ballognatha
Aspects: {'B. typica'}

Ballognatha is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders), with the single species B. typica. It occurs in Karakorum.
The species and genus were described based on a single immature and misclassified specimen. It is highly likely that there exists no real species with characters fitting the original description. Genus and species are thus a nomen dubium.


== Name ==
The genus name is a combination of the related salticid genus Ballus and Ancient Greek gnath- "jaw".

Title: Ar-Ra'd
Aspects: {'Q13'}

Ar-Raʻd (Arabic: الرعد‎, "The Thunder") is the 13th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur'an, composed of 43 verses (āyāt). It has Muqattat (Quranic initials)  المر (Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra or ALMR). 
The goal of the Sura: the power of truth and the weakness of falsehood.
It decides the oneness of God, the message, the judgment day and the penalty. The Sura revolves around an important axis that what is truth is clear through power and stability. And what is falsehood is clear through its weakness. No matter how it is dressed up and no matter how it pretends to be the truth. The verses call upon people to not be deceived by the glitter of falsehood because it is inevitably fleeting, while the truth shines throughout the entire universe.

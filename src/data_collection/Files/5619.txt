Title: Adieu False Heart
Aspects: {"I Can't Get Over You"}

Adieu False Heart is a Grammy-nominated 2006 album by American singer, songwriter, and producer Linda Ronstadt featuring Cajun music singer Ann Savoy. It peaked at #146 on the Billboard album chart.  According to Nielsen SoundScan, the disc sold a total of 67,203 copies as of December, 2016.
This was Ronstadt's last studio album before her retirement in 2011 and the revelation of her affliction with Parkinson's disease in 2013, which has left her unable to perform or sing.


== Production ==
Ronstadt, a soprano, and Savoy, an alto, sing together as The Zozo Sisters on the album, which brings together a mixture of Louisiana Cajun sounds, popular music of the 20th century, and folk/rock classics. The album includes an interpretation of The Left Banke's 1966 hit "Walk Away Renée", Harry Belafonte's 1950s hit by John Jacob Niles "Go Away From My Window" and the French classic "Parlez-Moi D'Amour". Ronstadt takes lead on Julie Miller's "I Can't Get Over You," with Julie's husband Buddy Miller on guitar and Savoy takes lead on Richard Thompson's "Burns' Supper." 
On her collaboration with Savoy, Ronstadt remarked: "We could have made a quilt, I guess, except we're musicians, so we're making a record together instead. She sings in French — I don't speak French — but there's traditional love in this bond."The album was recorded at Dirk Powell’s Cypress House Studio in Louisiana. It features local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of the Red Stick Ramblers, Sam Broussard of The Mamou Playboys, Dirk Powell and Joel Savoy, as well as Nashville performers, like fiddler Stuart Duncan, mandolinist Sam Bush and guitarist Bryan Sutton.

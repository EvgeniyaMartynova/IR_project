Title: Myrica rubra
Aspects: {'M. rubra'}

Myrica rubra, also called yangmei (Chinese: 杨梅; pinyin: yángméi; Cantonese: yeung4 mui4; Shanghainese: [jɑ̃.mɛ]), yamamomo (Japanese: ヤマモモ, "mountain peach"),  Chinese bayberry, Japanese bayberry, red bayberry, yumberry, waxberry, or Chinese strawberry (and often mistranslated from Chinese as arbutus) is a subtropical tree grown for its sweet, crimson to dark purple-red, fruit.


== Description ==
It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree growing up to 10–20 m (33–66 ft) high, with smooth gray bark and a uniform spherical to hemispherical crown. It is dioecious, with separate male and female plants. It tolerates poor acidic soils. The root system is 5–60 cm (2.0–23.6 in) deep, with no obvious taproot.
The fruit is spherical, 1.5–2.5 cm (0.59–0.98 in) in diameter, with a knobby surface. The surface color is typically a deep, brilliant red, but may vary from white to purple. The flesh color is similar to surface color, or somewhat lighter. The flesh is sweet and very tart. At the center is a single seed, with a diameter about half that of the whole fruit.

		
		
		


== Taxonomy ==
Myrica rubra is also called Morella rubra Lour., Myrica rubra var. acuminata Nakai. In studies of germplasm, it was clearly distinguished from wax myrtle, and could be subdivided into two groups unrelated to the sex of the plant, but more so by the geographic region in China where the accession originated. Among regions in China, accessions varied within regions, indicating extensive gene mixing. Nearly 100 cultivars of M. rubra exist in China alone. Zhejiang Province is a possible center of diversity for the plant in China.


== Distribution and habitat ==
It is native to eastern Asia, mainly in south-central China where it has been grown for at least 2000 years. Chinese cultivation is concentrated south of the Yangtze River, where it has considerable economic importance. Its niche is forests on mountain slopes and valleys at altitudes of 100–1,500 metres (330–4,920 ft).


== Cultivation ==
Yangmei is being commercialized in California by Calmei, a California corporation.  Yangmei trees are prolific producers, with a single tree yielding some 100 kilograms of fruit. As of 2007, 865,000 acres were devoted to yangmei production in China--double the amount of acres utilized in apple production in the United States.


== Uses ==
The tree is used as ornaments for parks and streets. It is also a traditional tree used in composing classical East Asian gardens.


=== Products ===
Some cultivars with large fruit, up to 4 cm in diameter, have been developed. Besides fresh consumption, the fruits may be dried, canned, soaked in baijiu (Chinese liquor), or fermented into alcoholic beverages, such as wine, beer, or cocktails. Dried fruits are often prepared in the manner of dry huamei (Prunus mume with flavorings such as licorice or salty licorice). The juice has been commercialised under the brand name "Yumberry" under which name it is trademarked in the EU. In Yunnan Province in China, there are two main types of yangmei, a sour type used for making dried fruit and a sweet type used for juice and fresh eating.
Other uses include

bottled pasteurized juice or juice blends
dye prepared from the bark
yogurt flavoring
blended jam and preserves


=== Research and phytochemicals ===
Various species of Myrica have been studied scientifically for horticultural characteristics or phytochemicals implicated with health benefits. Dating to 1951, the horticultural literature  includes studies on

nitrogen-fixing ability of the root nodules system
presence of Frankia bacteria having nitrogen-fixing properties in root nodules
microbial characteristics of the subcanopy soil
niche characteristics in the forest environment
growth of pollen tubes


== Cultural significance ==
Archaeological and written evidence suggest that yangmei cultivation first took place in China over 2,000 years ago during the Han Dynasty. Yangmei is mentioned throughout Chinese literature, including several appearances in Li Bai's poems.In Japan, it is the prefectural flower of Kōchi and the prefectural tree of Tokushima. The plant's name appears in many old Japanese poems.

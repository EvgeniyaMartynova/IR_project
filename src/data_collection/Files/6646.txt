Title: HMS Hebe
Aspects: {'J24'}

Five ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Hebe, after the Greek goddess Hebe.

HMS Hebe (1782) was a French 38-gun frigate captured in 1782, renamed Blonde in 1805, and broken up in 1811.
HMS Hebe (1804) was a 32-gun fifth rate in service from 1804 to 1813. Because Hebe served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp "Egypt" to the  Naval General Service Medal, which the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants.
HMS Hebe (1826) was a 46-gun Leda-class frigate launched in 1826, made a receiving ship in 1839, hulked in 1861, and broken up 1873.
HMS Hebe (1892) was an Alarm-class torpedo gunboat launched in 1892, converted to a minesweeper in 1909, and sold 1919.
HMS Hebe (J24) was a Halcyon-class minesweeper launched in 1936 and sunk by a mine off Bari in November 1943.

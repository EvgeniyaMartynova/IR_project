Title: European route E31
Aspects: {'E31'}

European route E 31 is an international Class-A road in Europe, part of the United Nations E-road network. It has a north-south reference.
It runs from Rotterdam, Netherlands to Ludwigshafen, Germany.
Firstly, it leaves Rotterdam, where it links to the E 19 and E 25 roads. It heads roughly east through the Netherlands, passing through Gorinchem (where it connects to the E 311), and Nijmegen before crossing the border into Germany.
It passes first through Goch and Krefeld in North Rhine-Westphalia and heads southwards before entering Cologne, where it links with four other E-roads: the E 29, the E 35, the E 37, and the E 40. It then continues south, going through Koblenz (where it connects to the E 44), and then on to Bingen am Rhein, where it makes its final connection, to the E 42. It then reaches its final destination of Hockenheim, where the E31 connects with the E50.
Its total length is 538 km (334 mi).
The route from Parma to La Spezia in Italy, although identified as E 33 in the E-network, is also signposted as E 31.

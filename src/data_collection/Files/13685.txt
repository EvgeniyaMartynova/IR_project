Title: List of historic properties in Nogales, Arizona
Aspects: {'U.S. Customhouse'}

This is a list which includes a photographic gallery, of some of the structures of historic significance in Nogales, Arizona. Nogales is a city in Santa Cruz County, Arizona which lies on the border of Mexico and is separated from the town of Nogales, Sonora in Mexico by a 20-foot-high row of steel beams, also known simply as the "Wall". Nicknamed the "Gateway to Mexico"  the two cities share a rich history that dates back thousands of years ago when ancient native people's trade routes went through the combined area.


== Brief history ==
The area where Nogales is located was inhabited by the Anasazi, an early Native-American tribe. The waters provided by the Santa Cruz River, Sonoita Creek and Harshaw Creek were ideal for fishing. The land was also ideal for agriculture and ranching. Ruins of the ancient settlements and petroglyphs of the Anasazi have been found by archaeologists. The region was later inhabited by the Hohokam, Apache and Yaqui tribes who built their communities along the river and creeks.In 1539, Spanish explorer Fray Marcos de Niza entered the area near Lochiel on the Mexican border. . He continued on his journey to Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico also known as the Seven Cities of Cibola. Marcos de Niza is credited with being the first European in what is now the State of Arizona. The prehistoric migratory route used by the ancient Indians was later named "El Camino Real" which is Spanish for "The King's Highway". The main Native-American tribes in the area at that time were the Sobaipuri and Papago tribes.In 1692, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino came to the area as a missionary. His main objective was to convert the natives to Catholicism. The area became part of his "La Mission en Guevavi". For the next two decades, he traveled through Southern Arizona spreading the Catholic faith and teaching the native people how to farm. Groves of walnut trees at one time covered the mountain pass that bridged the areas where the present-day Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico are located. The name of Nogales means "black walnut" in Spanish.The mission period was ended in 1768 by a decree of Charles III of Spain. In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence between Mexico and Spain came to an end and the territory of New Spain, which included Arizona, was ceded to Mexico.


== American settlers ==

In 1854, the United States purchased the region from Mexico in what is known as the Gadsden Purchase. Anglo-Americans of European descent from the East Coast of the United States began to arrive in the area. The vast Spanish land grants that had been established were broken up as settlers from the east moved west to homestead and ranch. The new settlers were protected from the constant attacks of the Apaches by the United States Military. However, The majority of the troops were withdrawn from the area upon the outbreak of the American Civil War. Fort Buchanan, which was actually a small garrison established in 1856 near Sonoita, was overrun by the Apaches. Thus, the miners, ranchers and farmers in the region were without protection from the Apaches and many of them moved to other areas. The Civil War between the North (the Union) and the South (the Confederacy) ended in 1865.In 1867, the United States Army established a military post called Camp Crittenden close to Sonoita. The camp, which later was renamed Fort Crittenden, was involved in a campaign against the Apache with the intention of protecting the American pioneers in the area. The miners, ranchers and farmers returned to the area once more.


== The border "Wall" ==

Tensions along the border started to rise with the Mexican Revolution which began in 1910. However, the Nogales area within the United States border had a military garrison of ten thousand men made up mostly of African-Americans soldiers from the 25th Regiment. The military buildup and related business growth attracted many businesses to Nogales, some of which remain today. In 1913, there was a violent battle between the Mexican Forces and Pancho Villa and his men in Nogales, Sonora. Villa and his men were victorious and occupied the area. In 1915 a second battle took place, this time Villa's men fired across the border line into the United States. U.S. cavalrymen crossed the border into Mexican territory and engaged Villa's troops.Another situation which caused tensions to rise between the U. S. and Mexico was that Germany began to encourage Mexico to declare war on the United States and take back its former territories during World War I. Thus, the United States kept a keen observation on the border to make sure that smugglers would not supply Mexico with guns and that refugees fleeing to the United States did not belong to an international espionage team backed by the Germans.The first border fence between the two nations was built between 1909 and 1911. They were actually a barbed wire fence installed by the U.S. government on the border to prevent cattle from wandering between the countries. Felix B. Peñaloza, the "Presidente Municipal" (which in Mexico is the term used for the word Mayor) of Nogales, Mexico, ordered construction of a fence running along the boundary line between his city and Nogales, Arizona. The fence in Nogales was built by Mexican workers. A metal obelisk marked the international border in both Nogales. American and Mexican sentries patrolled the line.
A firefight broke out between the American and Mexican sides of the fence when on August 27, 1918, an unidentified man tried to cross over to the Mexican side and refused to halt when ordered by a U.S. customs inspector. Both sides began to shoot at each other and at the end of the incident, which is known as the Battle of Ambos Nogales, 12 Mexicans and Americans were killed, including Mayor Peñaloza. Today, the fence is now a 20-foot-high row of steel beams, recently reinforced with razor wire.


== Pimeria Alta Historical Society and Museum ==
According to the website of the Pimeria Alta Historical Society and Museum, Housed in the Old Nogales City Hall, constructed in 1914, the museum provides information on the history of the Pimeria Alta and welcomes visitors to the border area. The society was formed in 1948, when a group of 28 concerned citizens got together to preserve the rich and exciting history of the area. The city of Nogales, Arizona was incorporated in 1893.

The fact that a property is listed in the National Register of Historic Places does not mean that the property is safe from being demolished by its owner. According to Jim McPherson, Arizona Preservation Foundation Board President: 
The city has three historic districts and various individual properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places

=== Districts ===
According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation: "a local historic district is an entire area or group of historic structures deemed significant to the city's cultural fabric that are protected by public review. This can include downtown commercial areas, main streets, waterfront districts, and residential districts." The following Districts are pictured and/or have images related to them:
The Crawford Hill Historic Residential District - Roughly bounded by Oak St., Terrace Ave., Compound St., and Interstate 19 and Grindell Ave. The Nogales Crawford Hill Historic Residential District was built on the slopes west of the arroyo dividing Nogales. It became the most substantial residential district in the city and has representative buildings from all periods of Nogales' history. The district includes 216 buildings. The district was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on August 29, 1985, reference: #85001874.
The Marsh Heights Historic District - Roughly Bounded by Court Street, Summit Avenue, South Court Street, and Morley Avenue.

The Pennington Rural Historic Landscape (not pictured) - Located at Junction of Royal Road and Calle del Rio Nogales. This National Register District conveys a pristine sense of Anglo-American pioneer agriculture and represents a cohesive rural historic landscape in southern Arizona after the acquisition of the area from Mexico. It includes a stone cabin, a field, an irrigation ditch, and an adobe ruin. The stone cabin is thought to be the oldest remaining house built by Anglo-Americans in Arizona. The field has been farmed almost continuously since 1858. The field is thought to have been irrigated by diverting the water from the Santa Cruz River into the ditch, which is no longer there, but that could be traced. The adobe ruin is thought to mark the former house of Albert Case Benedict, who was the third owner of the Pennington property. The property is associated with Elias Green Pennington, who was one of the first farmers along the upper Santa Cruz River, and his daughter, Larcena. The area was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on February 10, 2000, reference: #00000004.

Santa Cruz Bridge No. 1 - built in 1917 and located on River Road over the Santa Cruz River. It is one of the earliest major vehicular bridges undertaken by the Arizona State Engineer's Office, the Santa Cruz Bridge was for decades a regionally important river crossing. As such it is historically significant for the role it has played in southern Arizona transportation. Technologically, the bridge is distinguished as an outstanding representative of a formative structural type. Of the earliest structures, only the Santa Cruz, Hells Canyon and Antelope Hill bridges remain. The Santa Cruz Bridge is the earliest and longest-span concrete girder still in use on the state's road system.

The Hacienda Corona de Guevavi (Bed & Breakfast) - built in 1935 and located at 348 South River Road. Hacienda Corona is the former Guevavi Ranch headquarters. Records show the property was originally homesteaded by the Benedict family in the early 1900s. Its name honors the Mexican muralist and bullfighter, Salvador Corona, who painted its courtyard walls with scenes of Mexican peasants during the 1940s-1950s. Later, after then-owner Ralph Wingfield lent some of his cattle for use in the filming of the 1948 John Wayne classic, Red River, the hacienda became a Hollywood getaway. The rancher and Wayne were close friends, and the hacienda room in which Wayne frequently lodged is now a B&B room named "The Duke." The original card table the two used is also still present in the hacienda. Most of the ranch buildings are adobe with stucco, except an addition on the hacienda, which is block and stucco. The current owners restored the hacienda after their 2002 purchase.
The Camp Little Cottages and Historical Marker - The cottages along Western Avenue were built in 1915. These cottages represent Nogales' military post, Camp Little, and are architectural examples of the camp's military housing. Camp Little was located along what is now Western Avenue from Grand Avenue to Interstate 19. In 1910, following the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, large numbers of American troops were called in to Nogales. Their numbers increased and eventually contributed to the establishment of Camp Little, whose name was derived from that of a private in the 12th U.S. Infantry Division, Camp Stephen D. Little. Little was killed while on guard duty at the top of the hill on Crawford Street in November 1915. At one time, Camp Little had 12,000 troops stationed, but over the years, that number decreased and led to the closure of the camp on 13 May 1933. A historical marker nearby on the lawn of the Nogales City Hall is currently the only interpretative site associated with Camp Little.
Pete Kitchen Ranch - Located 3.5 miles north of Nogales off U.S. Route 89. The Pete Kitchen Ranch was established on Potrero Creek, about 1862, by Pete Kitchen. Reputedly it was the first permanent American ranch in Arizona. The site, which had good access to water, had been inhabited by the Anasazi, an early Native-American tribe, in prehistory and had been visited by Juan Bautista de Anza in October 1774, who called it Las Lagunas, a name also used by Kitchen. The ranch was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on February 20, 1975, reference: #75000360.

Title: List of mass spectrometry software
Aspects: {'Xcalibur (disambiguation)'}

Mass spectrometry software is software used for data acquisition, analysis, or representation in mass spectrometry.


== Proteomics software ==

In protein mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry (also known as MS/MS or MS2) experiments are used for protein/peptide identification. Peptide identification algorithms fall into two broad classes: database search and de novo search. The former search takes place against a database containing all amino acid sequences assumed to be present in the analyzed sample, whereas the latter infers peptide sequences without knowledge of genomic data.

=== De novo sequencing algorithms ===
De novo peptide sequencing algorithms are based, in general, on the approach proposed in Bartels  et al. (1990).

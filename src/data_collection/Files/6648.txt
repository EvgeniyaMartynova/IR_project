Title: NER Class P
Aspects: {'J24'}

The NER Class P (LNER Class J24) was a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotives of the North Eastern Railway. They were designed by Wilson Worsdell for mineral traffic.


== Modifications ==
As built, the locomotives had slide valves but 20 were fitted with piston valves and superheaters between 1914 and 1920.  The cylinder bore was increased by half an inch at the same time.
In the infobox (right) 'ns' denotes non-superheated and 'su' denotes superheated. Some locomotives later had their superheaters removed but the piston valves were retained.


== British Railways ==
Thirty-four locomotives survived into British Railways ownership in 1948 and their BR numbers were 65600-65644 (with gaps).


== Withdrawal ==
Withdrawals started under LNER ownership in 1933. British Railways quickly withdrew the remaining locomotives and all had gone by the end of 1951. None were preserved.

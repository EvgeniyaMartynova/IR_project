Title: Dian's tarsier
Aspects: {'T. dentatus'}

Dian's tarsier (Tarsius dentatus), also known as the Diana tarsier, is a nocturnal primate endemic to central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Its head-body length is 11.5–12 centimetres (4.5–4.7 in) and it has a tail of 22 centimetres (8.7 in). Dian's tarsier lives in rainforests. It was formerly called T. dianae, but that has been shown to be a junior synonym.It is found in primary, secondary, and mangrove forests. It is nocturnal and lives in small groups of two to seven members. It is highly adapted to vertical clinging and leaping, like other tarsiers, and has a strict live animal diet, mostly insects with some small vertebrates. Due to human intervention in the forest of South-east Asia, Dian's tarsier tends to adapt its ranging behavior based on the degree of human intervention. Slightly disturbed habitats have been shown to have little effect on the Dian's tarsier, but with larger disturbances, the habitat is less suitable.

Title: Soloviev D-20
Aspects: {'D20'}

The Soloviev D-20P was a low-bypass turbofan engine rated at 52.9 kN (11,900 lbf) thrust. It was built by the Soloviev Design Bureau, the world's first turbofan for use on the transport aircraft. The engine was used on the Tupolev Tu-124. A later derivative with increased bypass ratio, the D-20P-125, was developed into the Soloviev D-30 family of low and medium bypass engines.

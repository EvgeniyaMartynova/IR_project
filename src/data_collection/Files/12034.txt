Title: Tumansky R-29
Aspects: {'R29'}

The Tumansky R-29 is a Soviet turbojet aircraft engine that was developed in the early 1970s. It is generally described as being in the "third generation" of Soviet gas turbine engines which are characterized by high thrust-to-weight ratios and the use of turbine air cooling.

The Women's FA Cup (or SSE Women's FA Cup for sponsorship reasons) is the top cup competition for women's football clubs in England – designed as an equivalent to the FA Cup.
The competition began in 1970–71 as the Mitre Challenge Trophy, organised by the Women's Football Association (WFA). There were 71 entrants, including teams from Scotland and Wales.Since the Football Association (FA) began administrating English women's football in 1993, the teams affiliated with FA Premier League and Football League counterparts have dominated the re–branded competition. Arsenal currently holds the record for most titles, having won fourteen times. 
The Women's FA Cup trophy was one of the first prestigious trophies to be made in the Thomas Lyte silver workshop.The current cup holders are Manchester City. They defeated West Ham United 3–0 in the final at Wembley Stadium on 4 May 2019.

Between 2001–2008 the final of the tournament was covered by BBC TV, presented by Celina Hinchcliffe, Rebecca Lowe, Ray Stubbs and Jake Humphrey, the punditry team was usually current players like Sue Scott and commentary usually by Steve Wilson and Lucy Ward or Faye White and always played on May Day Bank Holiday.  The final was also simulcast on BBC Radio Five Live. In 2009 the final was moved to ITV1 with commentary from Jon Champion and Lucy Ward. Sky Sports secured a three-year deal for live coverage from 2010 until 2012.


== Sponsorship ==
Sponsors of the original WFA competition (1970–1993) included Mitre, Pony wines and Mycil.Below is a list of sponsors of the FA competition:

1995–1998: UK Living
1998–2002: AXA
2002–2006: Nationwide Building Society
2006–2011: E.ONFrom 2007, Tesco obtained additional branding and advertising rights through their partnership agreement with the FA. Despite sponsorship by these major companies, entering the tournament actually costs clubs more than they get in prize money. In 2015 it was reported that even if Notts County had won the tournament outright the paltry £8,600 winnings would leave them out of pocket. The winners of the men's FA Cup in the same year received £1.8 million, with teams not even reaching the first round proper getting more than the women's winners.

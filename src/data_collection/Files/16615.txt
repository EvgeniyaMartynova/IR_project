== Critical reception ==
Rafay Mahmood of The Express Tribune said that the film had its "heart in the right place", depicting "what an average soldier goes through in order to serve his country while taking care of his friends, love life and family" while "engaged on two different fronts with two different kinds of enemies â€” external and internal." However, he criticized the film's loose plot, describing it as an "omelette", as well as forced English dialogues, and the director's romanticism of the "posh side of the army lifestyle". He noted that if done right, the film "had the potential to wake up the sleeping giant that the Eid box-office can be."Areebah Shahid writing for Bolo Jawan gave the film 3 stars, appreciating the cinematography and war sequences but criticizing the script and editing.Momin Ali Munshi of Galaxy Lollywood described the film's starting action scenes as "wonderfully executed" and having "definitely set the right motion for the film", in addition to praising its background score; however, he noted that the introduction of multiple characters weakened the sequence of the plot, which made it a "star-studded hot mess".Faraz Talat of Dawn praised the acting of Adnan Siddiqui, Sana Bucha and Ayub Khoso, but said the movie suffered from an incoherent storyline, in addition to weaknesses in choreography, dialogues, production, and certain aspects of character development. While noting Yalghaar's expensive production value, he concluded that the "film industry needs more than just patriotism; it needs a will to explore new artistic territory."Sana Gilani of Daily Pakistan called Yalghaar "one of the most promising movies of [the] year" and viewed all characters positively, save for the female extras and the antagonist role played by Humayun Saeed, which she described as "aloof". According to Gilani, critics appeared to miss the fact that the movie relayed true events, which made the storyline and narrative obvious.Omair Alavi of Brandsynario commended Yalghaar as a "better option" for those wanting to watch a Pakistani film, and approved its action sequences, patriotic and emotion-laced appeal, war theme, as well as its cast which featured renowned and upcoming stars. However, he noted there were certain technical glitches, ordinarily executed scenes, and misplaced dialogues.

Title: ThinkPad W series
Aspects: {'W series'}

The ThinkPad W-series laptops from Lenovo are described by the manufacturer as being "mobile workstations", and suit that description by being physically on the larger side of the laptop spectrum, with screens ranging from 15" to 17" in size. Most W-series laptops offer high-end quad-core Intel processors with an integrated GPU as well as an Nvidia Quadro discrete GPU, utilizing Nvidia Optimus to switch between the two GPUs as required. Notable exceptions are the W500, which has ATI FireGL integrated workstation-class graphics, and the W550s, which is an Ultrabook-specification laptop with only a dual-core processor. The W-series laptops offer ISV certifications from various vendors such as Adobe Systems and Autodesk for CAD and 3D modeling software.
The W-series laptops were introduced by Lenovo as workstation-class laptops with their own letter designation, a descendant of prior ThinkPad T series models suffixed with 'p'. The W-series laptops were launched in 2008, at the same time as the Intel Centrino 2, marking an overhaul of Lenovo's product lineup. The first two W-series laptops introduced were the W500 and the W700.


== Models ==
A list of laptops in the W series is given below. The list is arranged in chronological order.


=== W500 ===
Released in 2008, W500 laptop was similar in design to the Txxp models it replaced. The all-black appearance was retained, as well as the TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard. The W500 was appreciated for being equivalent in craftsmanship and stability to previous ThinkPads. Large metal hinges were used to hold the display in place, preventing a worn out or unsteady display. Other features on the laptop were a DisplayPort video output, three USB ports, a docking station connector, a maximum display resolution of 1920 × 1200, Intel Core 2 Duo processors and an ATI FireGL v5700 GPU.


=== W700 ===
Released in October 2008, the W700 laptop was lauded for its performance and for a host of features that were industry-first at the time. It was the first laptop with an integrated color calibrator. In addition, a biometric fingerprint scanner was available on the palmrest. With a quad-core Intel Core 2 Extreme processor and NVIDIA Quadro FX 3700M workstation GPU available, the laptop was among the most powerful at the time. One point not in the laptop's favor was the low battery life—approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.
The laptop featured up to a 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9300 CPU, up to 8 GB of DDR3 RAM (two slots), either an (MXM-mounted) NVIDIA Quadro FX 2700M or FX 3700M  with up to 1 GB video RAM, and a 17-inch (43 cm) TN LCD display with a resolution of 1440 × 900 or 1920 × 1200.

=== W530 ===
Released in June, 2012, the W530 has a very similar exterior appearance to the prior W models. Being the last W model prior to the W540 redesign, it is the last W to feature the lid lock, keyboard light and wireless and HDD LED indicators, and the first W model to feature the controversial yet well-reviewed island-style keyboard, which features 6 rows rather than 7 rows of keys and a more modern key shape. The W530 comes equipped with Ivy Bridge processors.
Notable changes/new features:

3rd generation Intel Core (Ivy Bridge) processors
Mini DisplayPort v1.2
New-style keyboard with backlight


=== W540 ===
Announced in 2013 and released in the US and Europe early 2014, the W540 featured a brand new, slimmer design based on the new generations of T4xx series released the year before. 
Slimmer than the prior W530, the new design received mixed reactions from traditional ThinkPad users. Critique was mainly aimed towards lower build quality and missing user interface indicators, together with a new style of trackpad where the traditional ThinkPad trackpoint functionality had been radically changed, and the controversial Chiclet style keyboard introduced in 2012 on other products, which many enthusiasts claimed abandoned the core tactile principles established by IBM over previous decades.
The new W series however featured newer hardware such as the option for a 3K IPS display.

Other new features included:

Full size keyboard w/numeric keypad (though offset from center of screen, causing criticism from those who rarely use the keypad)
New trackpad/trackpoint integration (though TrackPoint "thumb" buttons were removed causing criticism due to lost tactile feedback)
Changed UltraBay design (the easy eject locking buttons were replaced by a hidden locking screw rendering "hot swap" functionality moot and earlier UltraBay modules incompatible)
New rectangular connector for charger (rendering earlier accessories and docking stations obsolete)
Thinner profile
Lighter weight


=== W541 ===
The Lenovo W541 is a ThinkPad W540 featuring the new-style keyboard but with a re-introduction of the classic ThinkPad trackpad design. The prior ThinkPad trackpad design featured in the W540 and other 4th-gen ThinkPads was abandoned.


=== W550s ===
Rather than being a successor of any previous W-series model, the Lenovo W550s is a thinner Ultrabook variant of the W series; Likewise a latest P5xs series ThinkPads, the W550s was based in a T-series chassis. While a capable Ultrabook, when compared to the W541 and its predecessors, it offers less capability with only dual-core hyper-threaded Intel Broadwell Processors vs. the true quad-core processors of other models and has only two RAM slots.


== Discontinuation and successor ==
The ThinkPad W series was discontinued and replaced by ThinkPad ThinkPad P series, beginning with the P50 and P70 in 2016. The P70 re-introduced the 17-inch screen to the ThinkPad workstation line.

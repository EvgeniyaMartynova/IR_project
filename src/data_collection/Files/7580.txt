Title: Lehigh Valley International Airport
Aspects: {'KABE', 'Kabe'}

Lehigh Valley International Airport (IATA: ABE, ICAO: KABE, FAA LID: ABE) (formerly Allentown–Bethlehem–Easton International Airport) is a domestic airport in Hanover Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. Parts are in Catasauqua and Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. It is 3 miles (5 km) northeast of Allentown, and two miles (3.2 km) northwest of Bethlehem, in the Lehigh Valley area. It is the fourth busiest airport in the state, after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Harrisburg.
The Federal Aviation Administration National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a non-hub primary commercial service facility. In previous years the FAA categorized the airport as a "small hub."
The number of people using the airport fell by 24.3% from 723,556 in 2012 to 582,000 in 2014 and the airport had seen declines in passenger usage from the early 2000s when annual traffic twice hit levels above 1,000,000 passengers. It has lately experienced a rebound due to being an alternative to the congested airports in Philadelphia and Newark, new improvements, a growing regional population, and new routes. In 2016 it had 688,505 passengers, an increase of 2.2% from 2015. In October 2017 it had 67,261 passengers, an increase of 19.6% from the 2016 month.It is becoming popular for the transportation of air cargo due to growth of e-commerce and close proximity to major population centers on the East Coast.  As of 2016, it ships more than 126 million pounds of cargo annually with growth of nearly 166% in cargo tonnage shipped between 2015 and 2016. Companies such as Amazon.com and FedEx Ground are using the airport, a major factor in its growth.The airport is about 75 miles (121 km) from Philadelphia International Airport, 80 miles (130 km) from Newark Liberty International Airport, and 55 miles (89 km) from Trenton-Mercer Airport.
The airport is a popular diversion airport for flights to the New York metropolitan area.
The one of the shortest scheduled jet flights in the contiguous US operates between ABE and PHL. Piedmont Airlines (American Eagle) regularly operates an ERJ-145 on the 55-mile route. Average time in the air is 20 minutes. It was the shortest flight in mainland America until 2017, when it was surpassed by Skywest (United Express) SFO to STS route in 2017 as that route has an average time in air of 16 minutes.


== History ==
Lehigh Valley International Airport opened in 1929 and is one of the few in the United States that serves its community from its original location. Scheduled airline flights began on September 16, 1935, by United Airlines Boeing 247s. The airport hangar served as the passenger terminal; the first terminal building at the airport was built in 1938, a Works Projects Administration project.
During World War II the U. S. Navy V-5 flight training program was conducted at the airport in conjunction with ground training held at Muhlenberg College. In addition, Headquarters of Group 312 of the Civil Air Patrol was at Allentown–Bethlehem Airport. One of its activities was to provide a courier service for cargo defense plants. Allentown CAP pilots also patrolled the Atlantic coastline and was active in recruiting young men for the air cadet program of the Army Air Force.
By January 1944 work on a new runway was completed and a Class A United States Weather Bureau station had been installed. About 1,000 Naval Aviation Cadets were trained in 1943, and civil and military air traffic had increased. In late July, the War Production Board approved the construction of a second story addition to the administration building. The building housed the Lehigh Aircraft Company, the weather bureau station, the Civil Aeronautic communications station, and the office and waiting room of United Air Lines. In August, the V-5 flight training program ended when the Navy decided to move all flight training to naval air bases under Navy pilots.
In April 1946 the Lehigh Airport Authority was created to own and manage the airport. The October 1946 C&GS diagram shows four runways forming an asterisk: runway 1 was 2680 ft long, 6 was 4000 ft, 9 was 3800 ft and 14 was 3100 ft.
A new passenger terminal began construction in 1948 and was finished in 1950. Allentown–Bethlehem–Easton (ABE) Airport, as it was now called, had flights on United, Trans World Airlines since 1947, and Colonial Airlines since 1949–50. DC-4s and DC-6s appeared after runway 6 was extended to 5,000 ft. TWA left in 1967, replaced by Allegheny; Colonial's successor Eastern remained until 1991. Republic DC-9 nonstop flights to Detroit started in 1986; regional partners replaced successor Northwest around 2003, as United's nonstop flights to Chicago had been replaced around 2001. Delta started nonstop flights to Atlanta in 1991 and its partner took over in 2002.
In 2012 Frontier Airlines started twice a week nonstop A319 flights to Orlando International Airport; they ended in 2013. Allegiant is now the only airline flying nonstop to Orlando, via the Orlando–Sanford International Airport (SFB).In 1960 Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy made campaign stops at ABE.
Construction began on the present terminal in 1973 and the project, designed by Wallace & Watson, was completed in 1976.The most recent Terminal Renovations were done in two phases.

Phase I (April 2009). Cost: $7,253,235; PENNDOT grant amount: $3 million; general contractor: Lobar, Inc. (Dillsburg, PA); architect: Breslin, Ridyard, Fadero Architects (Allentown, PA); square footage of the Phase I project: 24,000 sq.ft., 7,000 sq.ft. of which is new space.
Phase II (November 2010). Cost: about $7,225,000; PENNDOT grant amount: $3.5 million; general contractor: E.R. Stuebner Construction, Inc. (Reading, PA); architect: Breslin, Ridyard, Fadero Architects (Allentown, PA); square footage of renovated space: 33,600 sq.ft.On May 26, 2016, Solar Impulse 2 (SI2), piloted by Bertrand Piccard, completed the 13th leg (from Dayton, OH) of the first around the world (43,041 km)fuel-less flight by this solar-powered plane landing at ABE. On June 11, 2016, André Borschberg began the 14th leg (ABE to JFK – which included a dramatic Statue of Liberty flyover).  While at ABE, an open house was held for public viewing of the SI2 aircraft.

== Airlines and destinations ==


=== Passenger ===


=== Cargo ===
Amazon.com uses the Lehigh Valley International Airport (LVIA) as one of only 11 locations in the country for their Amazon Air shipping service. LVIA was one of the first airports selected for the pilot concept of the program due to its close proximity to large population centers, cost-effectiveness, robust infrastructure, and comparative ease of use. This location now ships more merchandise, has more flights, and serves more people (over 75 million from Boston to Washington, D.C., as of late 2016) for Amazon than any other facility in the country. Both Amazon and LVIA continue to invest heavily in the local area to better support the ever-increasing demand for air cargo driven in large part by the explosive growth of e-commerce and the need for faster, more efficient delivery of merchandise.Due to the same aforementioned reasons for Amazon increasing its operations at the airport, FedEx Ground has selected an area near LVIA to construct its largest terminal in the country.(ABE) currently, has six cargo parking spots for cargo operations.


=== Charter Operations ===
Kalitta Charters Operates service for H.E. Tex Sutton Airlines' horse transport on the Boeing 727, and flies in from various destinations, primarily Lexington. Other destinations include Ontario, Seattle, and Stewart.
Kalitta also flies cargo charters on the DC-9. 
Sun Country operates military charters to the airport. Sun Country also operates charters for various sports teams. 
Ameristar Also operates cargo charters into the airport via DC-9.
Air Canada Jetz Occasionally operates charters for the Toronto Marlies hockey club from Toronto, via Philadelphia.


== Bus service ==
Trans-Bridge Lines runs several daily buses from ABE to Manhattan, stopping at both Newark (EWR) and New York (JFK) Airports. Travel time to EWR is about 75 minutes.United Airlines also has a bus service to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). Continental Airlines, which later merged into United, previously operated flights from Allentown to Newark but switched to a bus service in 1995 due to constant delays from air traffic control. The distance is 79 miles (127 km). As of 1997 the service was eight times daily. Today, the service is offered 3 times daily By February 2010 the bus was the only form of service offered by Continental after it cancelled its Allentown to Cleveland Hopkins Airport flights.LANta provides local bus service to the airport with routes 215 (Bethlehem), 319 (Lehigh Valley Mall-Bethlehem Square), and 325 (Allentown).

== Reception ==
A.W. of The New York Times wrote in his review: "The parlay of Groucho Marx, Marie Wilson, William Bendix, to say nothing of a horse-racing mix-up, the United States Navy and sabotage should have paid off in plenty of laughs. But 'A Girl in Every Port,' which breezed into the Paramount yesterday, brimming with these ingredients, is merely an involved m√©lange of obvious antics and gags, only one or two of which are likely to generate chuckles."

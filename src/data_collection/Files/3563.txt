Aspects: {'F. pratensis'}

Festuca pratensis, the meadow fescue, is a perennial species of grass, which is often used as an ornamental grass in gardens, and is also an important forage crop.
It grows in meadows, roadsides, old pastures, and riversides on moist, rich soils, especially on loamy and heavy soils.
It is a tall, tufted grass similar to the tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea.  Tall fescue differs by having minute hairs on the auricles.  It can hybridise with 
Lolium perenne and Lolium multiflorum.

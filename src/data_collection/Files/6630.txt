Title: Toyota Land Cruiser (J40)
Aspects: {'J20'}

The Toyota Land Cruiser (J40),  is a series of Land Cruisers made by Toyota from 1960 until 2001. Traditional body on frame  SUVs, most 40 series Land Cruisers were built as 2-door models with slightly larger dimensions than the similar Jeep CJ.
The model was available in short (J40/41/42), medium (J43/44/46) and long (J45/47) wheelbase versions, with petrol and diesel engines.

== Models ==

The J40/41/42 was a two-door short wheelbase four-wheel-drive vehicle, with either a soft or a hardtop (V). It was available with various petrol or diesel (from 1974) engines over its lifetime. It was replaced on most markets from 1984 by the J70 series (70/71).
The FJ42 is 4X2 model, for only The Middle East.
The J43/J44/46 was an extremely rare two-door medium wheelbase four-wheel-drive vehicle, with either a soft or a hard-top (V). It was replaced on most markets from 1984 by the J70 series (73/74).
The J45/47 was a long-wheelbase four-wheel-drive vehicle, available in two-door hardtop, three-door hardtop, four-door station wagon and two-door pickup models. The four-door station wagon model (FJ45V-I) was the shortest-lived of the J40 series, as it was replaced by the FJ55G/V in 1967.
The Bandeirante TB25/TB41/TB51 Series are J25 series Land Cruisers built in Brazil by Toyota do Brasil Ltda from 1962 to 1968. In 1966 they were replaced by the OJ32 (soft top) and OJ31 (hard top) for the TB25, and the TB81 for the TB51; for an unknown reason the TB41 would keep its J2 code until 1968 when Toyota do Brasil switched to the J40 series.
The second generation Bandeirante OJ40/OJ45 Series (1968 to 1973), OJ50/OJ55 Series (1973 to 1994) and BJ50/BJ55 Series (1994 to 2001) are J40 series cars built in Brazil by Toyota do Brasil Ltda from 1968 to 2001. Identical to the BJ40 in almost every respect, it had a few stylistic modifications to the grille (models produced from 1989 on featured square headlights, instead of the round ones used before) and used Mercedes-Benz OM-314/OM-324/OM-364 diesel engines (replaced by Toyota 14B inline 4 direct injection Diesel engine in 1994) for much of its production life; another visible major characteristic are the entire hind doors (like at Land Rover) rather than the traditional Toyota two-wing hind doors at the Bandeirante's hard top models.

== Engines ==
The J40 series was produced with both diesel and petrol engines. The F series was a 6-cylinder petrol motor, B series a 4-cylinder diesel, and H series a 6-cylinder diesel.  The diesel trucks were never sold to the general public in the United States, though some found their way in as mine trucks.  Some engines are similar within their series; for example, the F and 2F engines share many of the same parts. However the H and 2H designations have almost nothing in common. 
Engines included (power and torque figures may vary depending on the market):


== Features ==
A pair of jump seats folded behind the front seats, maximizing cargo space compared to the full width folding rear seat of the Jeep CJ series.
Original factory optional winches were  P.T.O. driven. Later models were electric powered.


== Replacement ==

Toyota still offers many replacement parts for the J40,  available through Toyota parts departments worldwide.  Its essence lives on in the J70 series, which is essentially a J40 with an updated front half and slightly different engine offerings. It sells in many countries, but was never available in the United States.For 2006, Toyota introduced the FJ Cruiser, a modern SUV with trendy contemporary styling.  The FJ Cruiser (FJC) went on sale in the spring of 2006.


== In Brazil ==
In Brazil, the J40 was known as the Toyota Bandeirante, and made from 1968 until 2001. Those  built from 1958 to 1962 received the series code FJ25 (topless) and FJ25L (soft top) but are often referred to as FJ-251, and in 1961 thanks to a new motor called 2F - not to be confounded with the later 2F engine from 1975 - there still came out some few units with the series code FJ-151L (soft top). Bandeirantes built from 1968 to 1993 - with Mercedes-Benz engines - received OJ40/45 (OJ50/55 from 1973) series chassis codes and those built from 1994 to 2001 - with Toyota engines - have BJ50/55 series model codes.
Even though its production ended in Brazil many years ago, the Toyota Bandeirante is still very sought after, due to its good off-road performance. Thus Bandeirantes reach high prices in the Brazilian used car market, especially the rare 1993 models which were the only ones fitted with a Mercedes-Benz engine married to a five-speed transmission.

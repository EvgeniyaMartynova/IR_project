== Critical response ==
220 received a positive rating from music critic Phillip Mlynar of HotNewHipHop. He said that "While perhaps not as hungry as he was during his prime, Snoop Dogg has aged gracefully, owning his role as hip-hop's favorite uncle. Lyrically, he's still the same Snoop we all know and love; the iconic voice and infectious charisma never left."

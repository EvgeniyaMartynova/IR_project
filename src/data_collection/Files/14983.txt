Title: Washington Executive Airport
Aspects: {'W32'}

Washington Executive Airport (FAA LID: W32), also known as Washington Executive Airpark or Hyde Field, is a public use general aviation airport located 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of the central business district (CBD) of Clinton, in Prince George's County, Maryland, USA.
Hyde Field is one of the "Maryland 3" airports located within the Washington, D.C. Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ), so it is subject to the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) restrictions imposed by the FAA after the September 11 attacks.
It is located just 1.10 nautical miles (1.27 mi) east of a slightly smaller airport called Potomac Airfield.


== History ==
Hyde opened in 1934 as a training field for United States Army aviators. Due to the onerous SFRA restrictions leading to declining revenues at the airport, in 2008 there were plans to shut it down and redevelop the land. However, the airport has remained open and operational.


== Facilities ==
Washington Executive Airport/Hyde Field covers 140 acres (57 ha) and has one runway:

Runway 5/23: 3,000 feet (910 m) x 60 feet (18 m), Surface: Asphalt

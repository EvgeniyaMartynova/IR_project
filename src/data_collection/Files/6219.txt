=== 52nd Street Theme ===
A contrafact based loosely on rhythm changes in C, and was copyrighted by Monk under the title "Nameless" in April 1944. The tune was also called "Bip Bop" by Monk, and he claims that the tune's latter title was the origin of the genre-defining name bebop. It quickly became popular as an opening and closing tune on the clubs on 52nd Street on Manhattan where Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker played. It was first recorded by Dizzy Gillespie's sextet February 22, 1946 under the title "52nd Street Theme". Leonard Feather claims he gave the latter title.


== A ==


=== Ask Me Now ===
A tonally ambiguous ballad in D♭ first recorded on July 23, 1951 for the Genius of Modern Music sessions. It also appears on 5 by Monk by 5, and Solo Monk. Jon Hendricks wrote lyrics to tune and called it ”How I Wish”, and was first recorded by Carmen McRae on Carmen Sings Monk.


== B ==


=== Ba-Lue Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are ===
A riff-based blues in B♭ first recorded on October 9, 1956 for Brilliant Corners. The title references Pannonica de Koenigswarter's troubles with her stay at the Bolivar Hotel, where her parties would disturb the management of the hotel. It also appears on Les Liaisons dangereuses 1960, and on Monk's Dream; on the latter release, it was retitled "Bolivar Blues" or "Blue Bolivar Blues."  Live versions also appear from the albums recorded at the It Club and the Jazz Workshop.


=== Bemsha Swing ===
A tune Monk wrote with Denzil Best and was first recorded on December 18, 1952 for the album Thelonious Monk Trio. The tune is also known as "Bimsha Swing", because the word Bemsha is a re-spelling of "Bimshire". "Bimshire" is a colloquial nickname for Barbados, where Denzil Best was born. A 16-bar tune with an AABA-form. The 4-bar A-section is essentially in C major but borrows tones from the parallel C minor scale, and is transposed up a fourth to create the B section of the form. The tune also appears on Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants and Brilliant Corners, featuring Max Roach with a timpani drum added to his set, this inspired Monk's son "Toot" Monk to play the drums. Live versions appear on the albums recorded in Italy, Tokyo, It Club, Jazz Workshop, and the album Misterioso (Recorded on Tour).
Notable versions of the tune include Cecil Taylor's version on Jazz Advance, John Coltrane and Don Cherry's version on The Avant-Garde, Bill Evans's version on Conversations with Myself.
The funk rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers covered the song during their 1989-90 Mother's Milk Tour, renaming their version "F.U." with added lyrics. A live version can be found on their Out In L.A. album. Their bassist, Flea, is reportedly a huge fan of Thelonious Monk.


=== Bluehawk ===
A blues in B♭ first recorded on October 21, 1959 for Thelonious Alone in San Francisco. Monk wrote the tune after a visit from Guy Warren in 1958, the melody is borrowed from Warren's "The Talking Drum Looks Ahead" from the album Themes for African Drums. The title is a tribute to Monk's friend Coleman Hawkins, and the Black Hawk club in San Francisco.


=== Blue Monk ===
A blues in B♭ written in the studio and first recorded on September 22, 1954 for the album Thelonious Monk Trio, and is by far the tune Monk recorded the most. The melody is partly borrowed from Charlie Shavers' "Pastel Blue". Versions of the tune appear on Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers with Thelonious Monk, and Monk's Blues. The tune appears on almost every single live album by Monk, including the albums from Carnegie Hall, Five Spot, Town Hall, Tokyo, Newport (1958, 1959, 1963), It Club, and at the Jazz Workshop. Abbey Lincoln wrote lyrics to the tune around 1961, and was recorded by Carmen McRae as "Monkery's the Blues" on the album Carmen Sings Monk.


=== Blues Five Spot ===
A blues in B♭ dedicated to the Five Spot Café, and appears on Misterioso, Monk's Dream, and Live at the It Club.  It's also known as "Five Spot Blues".


=== Boo Boo's Birthday ===
A 21-bar tune in AAB-form. It was only recorded once, on December 21, 1967, for the album Underground. "Boo Boo" was the nickname of Monk's daughter, Barbara Evelyn Monk (September 3, 1953-January 10, 1984).


=== Brake's Sake ===
A tune that was recorded only twice, and the form is different on both versions. It was first recorded by Gigi Gryce with Monk as a sideman on October 15, 1955 for Gryce's album Nica's Tempo, and the second version was recorded February 10, 1964 for the album It's Monk's Time. Both versions have the AABA form, where the last A-section has an extended coda. The version from 1955 has 10 bars in the last A-section, while the version from 1964 has 12 bars, accordingly.


=== Bright Mississippi ===
A contrafact of "Sweet Georgia Brown" that Monk developed during the European tour in 1961, where the melody consists of staccato notes that outline the harmony. It was first recorded November 1, 1962 for Monk's Dream. Live versions also appear from the albums recorded at the It Club and the Jazz Workshop.


=== Brilliant Corners ===
A notoriously difficult 22-bar tune in ABA-form (8-7-7 bars respectively), where the head is first played slowly and then in double-time. The choruses in the solos also follow this form. The tune was first recorded October 15, 1956 for the album Brilliant Corners, and the song had notoriously 25 incomplete takes of the tune, and the final version was completed by producer Orrin Keepnews by cutting together the incomplete takes. The tune was later recorded in a simplified version November 20, 1968 for Monk's Blues with Oliver Nelson's orchestra.


=== Bye-Ya ===
A 32-bar Latin-tune in AABA-form that was originally titled "Playhouse" (as a dedication to Minton's, where Monk was the house pianist in the early '40s with Kenny Clarke). It was originally supposed to be arranged by Gil Fuller, when Monk was the pianist in Dizzy Gillespie's big band, but wasn't recorded until October 15, 1952 for the album Thelonious Monk Trio under the name "Bye-Ya". Producer Bob Weinstock wanted to call the tune "Go", but because of the Latin influence, Weinstock asked for a Spanish translation, thus "Go" became "Vaya", and "Vaya" became "Bye-Ya". The tune was later recorded for Monk's Dream, and live versions appear on the albums recorded at Carnegie Hall, Five Spot, and Lincoln Center.


== C ==


=== Children’s Song ===
A 16-bar (AA-form) composition in E♭, derived from the traditional children's counting song "This Old Man." It was only recorded once, on October 7, 1964, for the album Monk.The original stereo LP referred to the song as “That Old Man” on both the jacket and the label, but the mono LP listed the song as “That Old Man” on the jacket and “Children’s Song” on the label, as have later reissues of the stereo LP.  A 1984 European LP listed it as simply “Children’s Song,” but it has generally been known as “Children’s Song (That Old Man)” since the 2002 CD issue.


=== Coming on the Hudson ===
A 19-bar tune in AAB-form that Monk wrote in 1958 during his stay at Pannonica de Koenigswarter's house at Weehawken, New Jersey, where the house had a good view of the Hudson River. It was first recorded February 25, 1958 with Clark Terry, Johnny Griffin and Pepper Adams with Monk's rhythm section. This performance currently appears on Monk's Complete Riverside Recordings, though it first appeared on the 1984 rarities compilation Blues Five Spot. A live version appears on the 1958 album Thelonious in Action: Recorded at the Five Spot Cafe, and it was later recorded in studio for the album Criss-Cross.


=== Crepuscule with Nellie ===
A through-composed tune that is played without solos. Monk composed the tune throughout May 1957. The tune was originally titled "Twilight with Nellie", but Pannonica de Koenigswarter suggested instead to use the French word for twilight, which is crepuscule. The tune was first recorded with Monk's septet for Monk's Music; on that album (and on many of its reissues), "Crepuscule" was spelled "Crepescule" (3 e's, 1 u).  The tune also appears on Les Liaisons dangereuses 1960, Criss-Cross., and on the live albums from Carnegie Hall, Town Hall, France and Italy.


=== Criss-Cross ===
"Criss-Cross" (originally titled "Sailor Cap") was one Monk's very first compositions, he wrote early in 1944 as response to a collaborative project between Monk, Mary Lou Williams, and Bud Powell. It was first recorded July 23, 1951, for the Genius of Modern Music sessions, and was later featured on the 1964 album of the same name. On the first version, the tune is in a standard 32-bar AABA-form, but in the last version, the two last bars of the B-section are dropped.The tune inspired Gunther Schuller to compose variations on Criss-Cross, which premiered May 17, 1960, and was later released on Jazz Abstractions, featuring Ornette Coleman and Eric Dolphy as soloists.


== E ==


=== Epistrophy ===
"Epistrophy" (initially called "Fly Rite" or "Iambic pentameter") was co-written with Kenny Clarke, and was copyrighted June 2, 1941, and was the first tune copyrighted by Monk. It is a relatively atonal 32-bar tune in ABCB-form, though the key center is C♯.
The main melodic theme was composed by Clarke, after experimenting with fingerings on the ukulele, and the chords where written by Monk. The title "Epistrophy" is not a word in any dictionary. However, the word "epistrophe" is defined by Merriam-Webster as "the repetition of a word or expression at the end of successive phrases, clauses, sentences, or verses especially for rhetorical or poetic effect".
The tune appears on almost every single live album by Monk, as it was the closing tune of each set from Monk's days at Minton's Playhouse onwards. The first recording was by Cootie Williams on April 1, 1942, and it was later recorded by Clarke's band September 5, 1946. It was not recorded by Monk before July 2, 1948 for the Wizard of the Vibes sessions, featuring Milt Jackson. It was later recorded for Monk's Music and was an outtake from the It's Monk's Time sessions.


=== Eronel ===
A 32-bar tune in AABA-form originally composed by Sadik Hakim, co-written with Idrees Sulieman. It was recorded July 23, 1951 for the Genius of Modern Music sessions. However, Monk repeatedly changed notes and the chords to the tune and added the B-section, eventually making it "his" tune. Hakim originally wrote the tune in dedication to an old flame of Hakim, Lenore Gordon (Eronel is Lenore backwards). When the recording was released, it was only credited to Monk - Hakim and Sulieman didn't receive the composer's credit until Monk's death. It later appeared on Piano Solo, and on Criss-Cross.


=== Evidence ===
A contrafact of "Just You, Just Me". The title is a corruption from "Just You, Just Me" to "Just Us" to "Justice" to the final title "Evidence". The tune was first recorded July 2, 1948 for the Wizard of the Vibes sessions, featuring Milt Jackson, later on Piano Solo, and on Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers with Thelonious Monk. The melody and chord progression of the tune continued to evolve, finally gelling into a "definitive" form in later 1957, as heard on at Carnegie Hall and Thelonious_in_Action. Live versions appear on the albums recorded at Carnegie Hall, Five Spot, Blackhawk, Tokyo, Lincoln Center, It Club and the Jazz Workshop.

A 36-bar tune in AABA-form (8-8-8-12). It that was first recorded October 24, 1947 for the Genius of Modern Music sessions. It was also later recorded for the album Solo Monk.
The tune is notable for its radical chord progressions and form, as it is borderline atonal. In most jazz standards, the A-section is used to establish the key, while the B-section has tonal excursions, but in "Introspection", the roles of the sections are reversed. The A-section doesn't land on a stable chord until bar 6 where it lands on DΔ7, but the B-section establishes D♭Δ7 as a new key center. The last extended A-section finally lands on D♭Δ7 in the 4-bar coda.

Dianne Reeves sang the tune on her 2003 album A Little Moonlight.


=== Rhythm-A-Ning ===

The tune was later retitled "Ruby, My Dear" after Rubie Richardson, Monk's first love and his older sister Marion's best friend.

== S ==


=== San Francisco Holiday ===
A 32-bar tune in AABA-form that Monk composed New Year's Eve, 1959. The tune was initially titled it "Classified Information", but he opted to retitle it to "Worry Later", when recording it for the first time April 29, 1960 for the album Thelonious Monk at the Blackhawk. When it appeared on the album Monk in Italy, it finally appeared under the title "San Francisco Holiday", which Monk named after his family's long stay in San Francisco.

=== Sixteen ===
A 16-bar tune in AABA-form, and the title is from the tune's number of bars. Its only recording was done May 30, 1952, for the Genius of Modern Music sessions, but was not released officially until Mosaic Records released their compilation of Monk's Blue Note sessions.


=== Skippy ===
A 32-bar tune in ABAC-form, and is based entirely on cycling dominant chords (or their tritone substitutions). The tune's tonality is completely hidden until the last 4 bars clearly establish A♭-major. The tune was named after Nellie Monk's sister, whose real name was Evelyn. Its only recording was done May 30, 1952, for the Genius of Modern Music sessions, but has since the 2000s became a popular tune, with many cover versions. It is commonly agreed that the "Skippy"'s changes are based on Monk's reharmonization of "Tea for Two" (which he would later record on The Unique Thelonious Monk, and on Criss-Cross,) but Ethan Iverson argues that Monk composed "Skippy", then applied the changes to "Tea for Two".


=== Something in Blue ===
A 12-bar blues in B♭. It was only recorded once, at the marathon Black Lion Records session of November 15, 1971.


=== Straight, No Chaser ===

It has been recorded numerous times by Monk and others and is one of Monk's most covered songs.Lyrics were written by Sally Swisher and the song was recorded in 1988 by Carmen McRae as part of her studio album Carmen Sings Monk. For copyright reasons, the song was renamed "Get It Straight".
Music educator Mark C. Gridley wrote about Monk's composition style: "Monk employed simple compositional devices with very original results. His "Straight, No Chaser" involves basically only one idea played again and again, each time in a different part of the measure and with a different ending."


=== Stuffy Turkey ===
A 32-bar tune in D♭ major that was only recorded once, on February 10, 1964 for the album It's Monk's Time. The A-section is based on rhythm changes, and is borrowed from Coleman Hawkins's tune "Stuffy".

The A-section is based on a riff that Monk used very often, dating back to his days as the house pianist at Minton's Playhouse. The riff contains only the pitches B♭ and A, insisting on the tonic, and is reharmonized with descending chords.


=== Think of One ===
A 32-bar tune in AABA-form. The tune was first recorded November 13, 1953 and appears on the album Monk, and later appears on the album Criss-Cross. The tune is very similar in conception to "Thelonious", as the melody insists the tonic, with albeit more unexpected changes than in "Thelonious".


=== Trinkle, Tinkle ===
A 32-bar tune in AABA-form that is notorious for its difficult melody. It was first recorded December 18, 1952 for the album Thelonious Monk Trio, and later appears on the album Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane and on Monk's Blues.There are two stories about the origin of the title, the first explains that producer Ira Gitler may have misheard when Monk said the title of the tune in studio - Gitler reports that Monk may have said "Trinkle, Tinkle, like a star" instead of "Twinkle, Twinkle, like a star". It is also believed that the title is a corruption of the term "tickler", which was what the old stride pianists used to call themselves.


=== Two Timer ===
A tune that was never recorded by Monk, but was first recorded by Jackie McLean for his album A Fickle Sonance, under the title "Five Will Get You Ten". The tune was credited to Sonny Clark, who was struggling with heroin addiction at the time, and was a frequent visitor to Monk's friend, Pannonica de Koenigswarter's house. It is believed that since Monk kept most of his sheet music in Pannonica's house, Clark stole the lead sheet and claimed as his own, in hopes of the tune being a hit. The original lead sheet was later discovered around the '90s, and was first recorded by Monk's son for his album Monk on Monk.

=== Ugly Beauty ===
A 32-bar tune in AABA-form, and was only recorded once, on December 21, 1967, for the album Underground. It was Monk's drummer Ben Riley suggestion to play the tune as a waltz, and "Ugly Beauty" is therefore significant for being Monk's only waltz. Mike Ferro later wrote lyrics to the tune, and the song was recorded in 1988 by Carmen McRae as part of her studio album Carmen Sings Monk. For copyright reasons, the song was renamed "Still We Dream".

=== We See ===
A 32-bar tune in AABA-form, and was first recorded May 11, 1954 for the album Monk. It later appears on the albums Piano Solo under the name "Manganèse", and on Straight, No Chaser. The tune was initially called "Weetee", which was the nickname for Monk's cousin, Evelyn. Margo Guryan also wrote lyrics for the tune.


=== Well, You Needn't ===
A 32-bar tune in AABA-form that is one of Monk's most popular tunes, and is famous for its chromatically ascending/descending chords. The tune was earlier known as "You Need 'Na". The tune was first recorded October 24, 1947 for the Genius of Modern Music sessions. It later appears on Piano Solo, Monk's Music, and on Les Liaisons dangereuses 1960. Live versions appear on most of Monk's live albums.
The title was inspired by jazz singer Charles Beamon. Monk wrote a song and told Beamon he was going to name it after him, to which Beamon replied, "Well, you need not".There are three widely played versions of the tune;

Monk's version uses an F pedal in the A section, with an obbligato figure in addition to the melody. The line rises chromatically from C for each bar, then descends when it has reached E. The bridge starts on D♭, then ascends and descends chromatically to C, the dominant.
Monk would in later versions play alternatingly F and G♭ when comping, but keep the bridge as it was.
Miles Davis's version of the tune is comparatively more popular. Davis alters the A section's main motif, and tritone substitutes Monk's changes during the bridge. Therefore, Miles Davis starts the melody of the bridge a half-step too low. He later recorded a contrafact of the tune, called "I Didn't", and appears on the album The Musings of Miles.Mike Ferro later wrote lyrics to the tune, and the song was recorded in 1988 by Carmen McRae as part of her studio album Carmen Sings Monk. For copyright reasons, the song was renamed "It's Over Now".

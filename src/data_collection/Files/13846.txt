Title: U.S. Route 30 in Ohio
Aspects: {'U.S. Route 30N'}

U.S. Route 30 (US 30) is a United States Numbered Highway that runs from Astoria, Oregon, to Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the US state of Ohio, it is a major, 245-mile-long (394 km), east–west highway that runs through the northern section of Ohio. Overall, the highway runs through rural areas of the state dominated by farm fields or woodlands; some segments are urban in character in the Mansfield and Canton areas.
The first transportation routes along US 30 in the state was the Lincoln Highway. In the early 1920s, two different state routes in the initial state route system. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US 30 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several cities and villages in the area. Future improvements to the route of US 30 includes a proposed easterly extension of the four-lane divided highway from Canton to SR 11, near Lisbon.


== Route description ==
US 30 runs for 249.69 miles (401.84 km) through northern Ohio. Between the Indiana state line and Canton, US 30 is a divided highway, with sections of freeway between Van Wert and Delphos, Upper Sandusky and Mansfield, around Wooster and a final section in the area of Massillon and Canton. Like other state routes, it is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). All of US 30 in the state has been listed on the National Highway System.The portion of US 30 within Hancock County is designated "Congressman Michael G. Oxley Memorial Highway", in honor of the late former U.S. representative, who was born in and represented that area of Ohio.

== History ==
The Lincoln Highway was the first route to follow the corridor of US 30 in Ohio. The Lincoln Highway was established in 1913, following the current route of SR 309 and SR 81. Improvements and realignment to the highway were planned in 1917 and was to start in the spring of 1918. The route was built to relieve some of the railroad congestion. The Lincoln Highway realignment project was completed in 1939 and moved the Lincoln Highway to the modern US 30 corridor. The Lincoln Highway in Ohio became known as SR 5 between Indiana state line and Mansfield, SR 10 between Mansfield and Wooster, and SR 5 between Wooster and Pennsylvania. In 1925, the Federal Highway Association was established and one year later US 30 was established. US 30 followed the current route of SR 309. US 30 eastern terminus in Ohio was relocated to the West Virginia state line, in 1928. The route became divided in 1932, with US 30N taking the current alignment of US 30 and US 30S taking the current alignment of SR 309.The bypass around the south side of Dalton was completed in December 1953. In 1966 and 1967 a four-lane section of US 30 opened between SR 49 and US 224. US 30 became a four-lane highway between Indiana state line and SR 49 in 1969. Between 1970 and 1971, US 30 between Delphos and Beaverdam was completed. In 1971 the section of road between current SR 172, West of East Greenville, and SR 21 was open to traffic. The divided routes were removed in 1974 with US 30S, becoming SR 309 and US 30N becoming US 30. In 1979 the section of four-lane road between Van Wert and Delphos open to traffic. Also in 1979 US 30 between Dalton and the I–77 interchange was upgraded to a four-lane divided highway and opened to traffic. Between 1983 and 1985 the section from I–77 to Trump Avenue was opened to traffic. In 1999 a four-lane section of US 30 was opened between SR 696 and SR 235. The highways between Upper Sandusky and Ontario was upgraded to a four-lane limited access highway and open in 2004 and 2005. During 2007 and 2008, the upgraded section of US 30 between SR 235 and Upper Sandusky, was opened to traffic.


== Future ==
The section of US 30 between Canton and SR 11 has been studied many times for upgrades since at least 1989. The route was studied several times between 1991 and 2001. The route was studied again was in 2010. In 2012, the ODOT was studying the section again, with plans to create a toll highway along the corridor. Plans to toll the future highway were rejected in 2013. The expansion was discussed further in 2014, with a consensus brewing that local funding must be involved for the project to go ahead. In September 2016 the director of the Ohio Department of Transportation approved a regional transportation improvement project allowing the counties of Stark, Carroll, and Columbiana, the three counties along the corridor, to work collectively to secure funding for the extension.

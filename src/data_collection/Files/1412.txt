Title: Harish-Chandra's c-function
Aspects: {'C-function'}

In mathematics, Harish-Chandra's c-function is a function related to the intertwining operator between two principal series representations, that appears in the Plancherel measure for semisimple Lie groups.  Harish-Chandra (1958a, 1958b) introduced a special case of it defined in terms of the asymptotic behavior of a zonal spherical function of a Lie group, and Harish-Chandra (1970) introduced  a more general c-function called Harish-Chandra's (generalized) C-function.  Gindikin and  Karpelevich (1962, 1969) introduced the Gindikin–Karpelevich formula, a product formula for Harish-Chandra's c-function.

The c-function has a generalization cw(λ) depending on an element w of the Weyl group.

        c

        )
        =

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c(\lambda )=c_{s_{0}}(\lambda ).}
  The c-functions are in general defined by the equation

  
    
      
        
          A
          (
          s

          =

              s
            
          
          (

            ξ

    {\displaystyle \displaystyle A(s,\lambda )\xi _{0}=c_{s}(\lambda )\xi _{0},}
  where ξ0 is the constant function 1 in L2(K/M). The cocycle property of the intertwining operators implies a similar multiplicative property for the c-functions:

  This reduces the computation of cs to the case when s = sα, the reflection in a (simple) root α, the so-called 
"rank-one reduction" of Gindikin & Karpelevič (1962). In fact the integral involves only the closed connected subgroup Gα corresponding to the Lie subalgebra generated by 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              g
            
          
          
            ±
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}_{\pm \alpha }}
   where α lies in Σ0+. Then Gα is a real semisimple Lie group with real rank one, i.e. dim Aα = 1,
and cs is just the Harish-Chandra c-function of Gα. In this case the c-function can be computed directly and is given by

== Plancherel measure ==
The c-function appears in the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions, and the Plancherel measure is 1/c2 times Lebesgue measure.


== Generalized C-function ==


== p-adic Lie groups ==
There is a similar c-function for p-adic Lie groups. 
Macdonald (1968, 1971) and Langlands (1971) found an analogous product formula for the c-function of a p-adic Lie group.

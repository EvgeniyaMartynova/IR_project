Aspects: {'A Merry Little Christmas'}

A Merry Little Christmas is a Christmas album by American singer/songwriter/producer Linda Ronstadt, released in 2000.  It was the final release under Ronstadt's recording contract with the Elektra/Asylum Records label for whom Linda had recorded since 1973 (twenty-seven years to that point).  John Boylan returned to the scene as Linda's producer - and manager - for this disc.  Boylan remains Linda's official representative as of 2019.
It was the biggest-selling Holiday album of the 2000 Christmas season.  It peaked at #179 on Billboard's main album chart and continued to sell year in and year out.

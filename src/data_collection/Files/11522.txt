Title: Korea Media Rating Board
Aspects: {'R rating'}

The Korea Media Rating Board (KMRB) is a ratings organization in South Korea. They rate movies, videos, stage performances, and phonogrames. The current chairperson is Kyung-Soon Lee. It was founded in 1966 as "South Korea Art and Culture Ethics Committee" before changing into current name in 1999.
Initially, the KMRB also rated video and computer games; However, they rated a gambling game machine called Sea Story (Bada Iyagi) as if it were an ordinary game, due to a bribe, confusing the Korean game industry. After some controversy, the Korean government established the Game Rating Board for rating games in 2006.

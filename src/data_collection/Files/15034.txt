== History ==

Hasanuddin Airport, originally named Kadieng Flying Field, was built in 1935 by the government of the Netherlands Indies, approximately 22 kilometers to the north of Makassar. An airfield runway with grass-sized 1600m x 45m (Runway 08-26) was inaugurated on 27 September 1937 by a commercial flight from Singapore, a Douglas Aircraft D2/F6 operated by KNILM (Koninklijke Nederlands Indische Luchtvaart Maatschappij). In 1942, the government of Japan expanded the field using POW labor and renamed it Field Mandai. In 1945, the Dutch built a new runway.
In 1950, Indonesia's Department of Public Works, Section Flying Field, took over the field, and in 1955 it was transferred to Civil Aviation, now the Directorate General Air Transportation, which extended the runway to 2345m x 45m and renamed the airport Air Mandai. In 1980, the 13–31 runway was built—2500m x 45m; in the same year the name changed to Air Port Hasanuddin. In 1985 the Port of Hasanuddin Air changed its name to Hasanuddin Airport.
On 3 March 1987, management of the airport was transferred from the Directorate General of Air Transport to Perum Angkasa Pura I, based on Government Regulation No. 1 / 1987 of 9 January 1987. On 1 January 1993 the company name changed to PT (Persero) Angkasa Pura I. On 30 October 1994, Hasanuddin Airport, now International Airport in accordance with the decision of the Minister of Transportation, KM number 61/1994 dated 7 January 1995, was inaugurated by the Governor Level I Regional Head of South Sulawesi Province. 28 March 1995 marked the flight by Malaysia Airlines directly from Kuala Lumpur to Hasanuddin, followed by a Silk Air flight from Singapore Changi Airport. Since 1990, Hasanuddin Airport has been used as an embarkation / disembarkation point for Hajj pilgrimages to Jeddah.
Hasanuddin Airport serves the Eastern Indonesia Area and South Sulawesi Province. On 20 August 2008 the new terminal opened, replacing the old terminal which was subsequently transferred to the Indonesian Air Force.
On 8 January 2010, the airport inaugurated its newly built 3100 m runway (03/21) for commercial flights. With the opening of the 2nd runway, Hasanuddin became the second commercial airport in Indonesia that has two runways, the other being Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta. It is also one out of only two airports in Indonesia to include cross runways, with Budiarto Airport near Serpong which serves as flying school.

The airport now handles three wide-body aircraft per day - one 747-400 to Medan and Jeddah and two Airbus A330-200s to Jakarta. The local government plans to extend the runway from 3100m to 3500m to accommodate larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380, and is pending local clearance.
In October 2014 the airport implemented silent boarding, which means no announcements are made until the final boarding call.


== Terminals ==

The old terminal was completely vacated after the opening of the new terminal in 2008 and is currently used is used by the TNI-AU (Indonesian Air Force) which houses Skadron Udara 11 (Air Squadron 11).
The new terminal is located just south of the old terminal. It has the capacity to handle 7 million passengers and in 2010 served 5 million, It is five times larger than the old terminal, and includes six jetbridges. It is the first airport terminal in Indonesia designed in a high-tech architecture style.
The terminal will be expanding soon and 2 more aerobridges will be added for International Flight


== Traffic figures ==

Since the beginning of the new millennium, passenger numbers have increased more than sixfold. Historically air freight traffic has played a minor role in Makassar from an economic standpoint. 
It has developed slowly in part due to the relatively high license fee by the operator, currently 25 rupiah per kg of body construction and 15 rupiah per kg for the goods introduction.

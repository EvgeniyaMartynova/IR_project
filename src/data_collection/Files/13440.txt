Title: European Federation for Transport and Environment
Aspects: {'T&E'}

The European Federation for Transport and Environment, commonly referred to as Transport & Environment (T&E) is a European umbrella for non-governmental organisations working in the field of transport and the environment, promoting sustainable transport in Europe; which means an approach to transport that is environmentally responsible, economically sound and socially just. 


== History ==
T&E was created in 1990 with the realisation that many political decisions that influence the environmental damage caused by transport - both positively and negatively - are taken at a European level. These involve getting transport prices right, vehicle emission limits, fuel quality standards, taxes, funding of infrastructure, safety requirements, air quality standards, deregulation and liberalization and more.


== Mission ==
Transport & Environmentâ€™s mission is to promote, at EU and global level, a transport policy based on the principles of sustainable development. Transport policy should minimise harmful impacts on the environment and health, maximise efficiency of resources, including energy and land, and guarantee safety and sufficient access for all.

=== Mind the Gap ===
Issued every year, this report examines the difference between the official laboratory test results and real-world CO2 emissions and fuel economy of cars. The difference between official laboratory test results and real-world car performance is jumping from 9% in 2001 to 28% in 2012 and 42% in 2015. It is expected to reach 50% before 2020. One of the sources for real-world fuel consumption values used in this study is the data set provided by Spritmonitor.

Title: Suzuki V-Strom 1000
Aspects: {'V-Strom'}

The Suzuki V-Strom 1000, also known as the DL1000, is a dual-sport motorcycle  with a 996 cc V-twin engine and a standard riding posture. It has been manufactured in Japan by Suzuki since 2002, although sales in Europe ended in 2009.
The name V-Strom combines "V" referring to the bike's engine configuration with the German Strom, meaning stream or power.
The V-Strom motorcycle is based on the V-twin engine initially designed for the Suzuki TL1000S and TL1000R motorcycles.  It incorporates design elements from other Suzuki motorcycles including fuel injection based on the GSX-R models. A smaller-engined version, V-Strom 650 is also manufactured.
Kawasaki marketed an identical version of the bike named the KLV1000 in Europe.

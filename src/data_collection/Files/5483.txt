Title: Point of View (Cassandra Wilson album)
Aspects: {'I Am Waiting'}

Point of View is the debut studio album by American jazz singer Cassandra Wilson, recorded in Brooklyn, New York, in December 1985, as the fourth release of the German JMT label in 1986. It was also one of the first albums of a group of musicians around Steve Coleman, that became known as M-Base. 


== Reception ==
Writing for Allmusic on the occasion of the albums reissue on Winter & Winter in 2001, Scott Yanow gave the album a star rating of four out of five and praised Wilson's effort to "find a role for her voice" among "overcrowded ensembles". He described Wilson as a "chance-taking singer in a funky M-Base setting."

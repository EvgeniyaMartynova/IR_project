Aspects: {"O'Donovan Rossa GAA"}

Ardboe O'Donovan Rossa GAC (Irish: CLG Ard Bó Uí Dhonnabhain Rosa) is a club based in east County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, close to the shores of Lough Neagh. The club was formed in 1947 but Gaelic games had existed under different banners from the early 20th century. 
The club has won a total of seven Tyrone Senior Football Championships, the last in 1998 when they defeated Omagh. 
Notable past players include Frank McGuigan and Fay Devlin. Current Tyrone senior panellists include McGuigan's sons Brian and Tommy. Kyle Coney was a member of the 2008 Tyrone team that won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship. Ger Teague (son of Enda) also played for tyrone u15 but was unfortunately dropped from the panel in 2017


== Michael Coney Park ==
Michael Coney Park is the home ground of Ardboe O'Donovan Rossa GAC, situated on the Kilmascally road near to the main parish centre. 
In the 1970s the club constructed the main pavilion building and the surrounding facilities. In the following years new fencing was erected and a new covered stand and terracing to further improve the club's grounds. 
In recent years the club purchased a new training field near the current playing field. Both pitches became Prunty pitches and floodlights were installed, permitting training during the winter months.

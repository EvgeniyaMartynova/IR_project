Leanos initially asserted that the relationship was forced by the couple's record label, Columbia. However, weeks later he appeared to walk back this claim in an interview on Open Late with Peter Rosenberg, stating "Honest to God, I would say like most of the reason the breakup happened was because of me. It was my fault. We could have still been together, but I just feel like I fucked everything up. It also put me in a darker place because I was getting slammed left and right." He went on to say that he had "nothing but love for the Cyrus family."Leanos has been open about his former addiction to benzodiazepines (particularly Xanax) as well as opiates.

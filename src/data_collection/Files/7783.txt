Title: Leptolalax gracilis
Aspects: {'L. gracilis'}

Leptolalax gracilis is a frog species in the family Megophryidae. It is endemic to northern Borneo: Brunei, Kalimantan (Indonesia), and Sarawak (Malaysia). Earlier record from the Malay Peninsula and Thailand refer to other species (at least Leptolalax platycephalus, an unnamed species, and possibly Leptolalax melanoleucus). Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests, moist montane forests, and rivers. It is becoming rare due to habitat loss.

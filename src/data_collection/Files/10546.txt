Title: Palaeospheniscus gracilis
Aspects: {'P. gracilis'}

Palaeospheniscus gracilis is a species of the extinct penguin genus Palaeospheniscus. It is the smallest species of its genus, with a height of 40 to 60 centimetres (16 to 24 in). Average individuals, thus, were about the size of the Galapagos penguin.


== Description ==
This species was long believed to have first been found in Early Oligocene deposits. However, it seems that the type specimen, a tarsometatarsus, was recovered not from Early Oligocene rocks, but was found on top of them, having been displaced there from a later stratum. The location where the bone was found seems to have been near Cabeza Blanca. At any rate, all later specimens were found in the Early Miocene Gaiman Formation; those that have locality data are from the area around Trelew and Gaiman in Chubut Province, Argentina.Some recent researchers have suggested that this species should be considered a synonym of Palaeospheniscus bergi.

== Work ==
Nash's prolific career as a director of fiction films, often from works by popular authors of the day, such as Hall Caine and W.P. Drury, was ended by the official condemnation of his 1921 film How Kitchener Was Betrayed. The film suggested that the vessel carrying Lord Kitchener had been sunk by enemy action rather than a mine, leading to a de facto ban on the film in Britain.
After this setback, Nash worked on a number of documentary films for the Federation of British Industries on topics including the Manchester Ship Canal, Oxford University Press and the British underwear industry.His wide experience on films with naval subjects saw him work as an advisor on Walter Summers' 1927 film The Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands.

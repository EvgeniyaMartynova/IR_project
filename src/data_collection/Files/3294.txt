The expressway is an important route connecting the greater Osaka area with Takamatsu, the capital of Kagawa Prefecture. Beyond Takamatsu, the route follows a westerly course parallel to the Seto Inland Sea to its terminus with Matsuyama Expressway and Kōchi Expressway in Shikokuchūō. 
The speed limit is 80 km/h along the majority of the route, there are some 100 km/h sections between Naruto Junction and Tsuda-Higashi Interchange and Takamatsu-Nishi Interchange and Kawanoe Junction.

The first section of the Takamatsu Expressway to open was between Zentsuji and Mishima-Kawanoe interchanges on 16 December 1987. The final section of the expressway (9.1 km between Takamatsu-Chūō and Takamatsu-Nishi Interchanges) was opened on 30 March 2003. The 16.2 kilometres (10.1 mi) long Takamatsu-higashi Road was incorporated into the Takamatsu Expressway on 21 November 2017.


== List of interchanges and features ==
IC - interchange, SIC - smart interchange, JCT - junction, SA - service area, PA - parking area, BS - bus stop, TN - tunnel, TB - toll gate


=== Naruto TB - Takamatsu-Nishi IC ===
Due to open the expressway from Takamatsu towards Matsuyama, kilometer markers between Naruto Toll Gate and Takamatsu-Nishi Interchange show the distance from Naruto Toll Gate plus 100 (the marker at Naruto Toll Gate is 100.0 while the marker at Takamatsu-Nishi Interchange is 165.4). Therefore, the exit numbers continue from the sequence of the Takamatsu-Nishi Interchange, starting at 7. 


=== Takamatsu-Nishi IC - Kawanoe JCT ===


=== Sakaide Route ===
To prevent confusion with the main route, kilometer markers along the Sakaide Route show the distance from Sakaide Junction plus 500 (the marker at Sakaide Interchange is 500.0 while the marker at Sakaide Junction is 502.0).

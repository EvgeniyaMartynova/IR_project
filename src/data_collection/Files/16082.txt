Title: Yokohama Municipal Subway
Aspects: {'Y Train'}

Yokohama Municipal Subway (横浜市営地下鉄, Yokohama-shiei chikatetsu) is the rapid transit network in the city of Yokohama, Japan, south of Tokyo in Kanagawa pref. It is operated by Yokohama City Transportation Bureau as two lines, though three continuous lines exist.


== Lines ==

The Yokohama Municipal Subway lines are line 1, line 3 and 4.
Lines 1 and 3, connecting Shonandai station and Azamino station, are operated integrally, nicknamed the Blue Line.
Line 4 Hiyoshi station - Nakayama station is nicknamed the Green Line. Upon the opening of this line on March 30, 2008, the Blue Line and Green Line monikers came into official use.


=== Blue Line ===
The Blue Line (line 1 and line 3) is operated as an integral route of 40.4 kilometres (25.1 mi) between Shonandai station and Azamino station. The Blue Line is Japan's second-longest subway line, after the 40.7 km (25.3 mi) Oedo Line on the Toei Subway in Tokyo.
In July 2011, the "mobile phone power off area" was set up in each vehicle, and it was decided to officially ban the use of mobile phones except for calls outside the area.


=== Green Line ===
The Green Line (line 4) opened on March 30, 2008 at Hiyoshi Station-Nakayama station, operating distance 13.0 km (total extension distance 13.1 km).
It was originally scheduled to open in 2007.  The opening was postponed for one year due to the difficulty of expropriation of land in the vicinity of Hiyoshi honcho from Hiyoshi station to Hiyoshi-Honmachi station.


=== Planned extensions ===


==== Blue Line ====
An extension of the Blue Line (line 3) is being studied from Azamino station to the new Yuri-Oka station in Kawasaki City.


==== Green Line ====
The Green Line was built as part of a larger master plan to construct the Yokohama Ring Railway. The Ring Railway is a proposed C-shaped line that connects to the Yokohama station, which is connected to the Motomachi-Chinatown station via Hiyoshi station, Zhongshan Station, Futamatagawa Station, Higashi-Totsuka station, Kami-Ooka station and Negishi station from Tsurumi station.


=== Canceled Line 2 ===
Line 2 was planned as a 11.4 km (7.1 mi) line from Kanagawa Shin-machi station. Although it had been considered as a bypass line for the congestion easing of the Keikyu main line in parallel, the need for construction was obviated when the Keikyu line increased its capacity. In 2004, the Yokohama Minatomirai Railway Company opened the Minatomirai Line on a slightly different path.
The original plan for Line 3 called for it to connect Honmoku and Katsuta, and a portion of the tunnel toward Honmoku was completed from the Kannai station yard. In 1975, construction of the line caused criticism from the port industry; groups such as the Yokohama Port Union Association and the Yokohama Shipowners' Association claimed thatr subway construction was increasing traffic around the port and affecting its usefulness, asking for the postponement of the project. As a result of the ensuing negotiations, the construction started after completion of the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway Yokohane Line Yamashita Interchange and Yamashita Nagatsuta line. When the MM21 plan was announced in 1981, the construction of the line to Honmoku was frozen; the corresponding business license was withdrawn in 1988, sealing the project's fate.


=== Station numbering ===
Numerical designations for the stations on the Blue Line were introduced in 2002, coinciding with the city hosting the finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup and the subway's 30th anniversary, starting from Shonandai station (1) to Azamino station (32). With 32 stations on the line and 32 teams in the World Cup, each station was themed after a country. Alphabetical designations were added when the Green Line opened. The Blue Line stations are B01 through B32, while G01 on the Green Line is Nakayama Station. At two stations—Center South Station and Center North Station—where both lines overlap, a different station number is attached to each route.


== Adult fares ==
Normal passenger fares (for children half-price and IC cards are rounded down less than 1 yen, rounded up less than 10 yen for ticket purchases). Revised on October 1, 2019, the same day.


=== Ticket ===


==== One day ticket ====
"One-day subway ticket" (Adult 740 yen), "bus and subway Common day ticket" (adult 830 yen) and have been released (both children are half-price, rounded up less than 10 yen).


==== "Vouchers that can be used repeatedly" ====
Tickets can be used even if the section of the same fare is different as the Tokyu Corporation and the Tokyo Metro. In addition to regular tickets, the discount tickets for daytime, Saturdays and holidays on weekdays (not available on Saturdays and holidays until June 1, 2014) are available on Saturdays and holidays only.
There is also a discount ticket for schools that are available for communication students in the office of a certain station (see the Yokohama City Transportation Bureau subway ticket).


==== "Children anywhere 110 yen" ====
During the summer holidays, the children's fares are 110 yen, and the children's fares are 110 yen in all sectors. In this case, the passenger buys a ticket of 110 yen at the train station, enters from the automatic ticket gate, and passes the ticket to the attendant at the station where it gets off (generally put in the box and the bag). It may be put in the automatic ticket gate as it is normally in the 110 Yen section originally.
In addition, because the section of 110 yen is cheaper than 108 yen to use the IC ticket, such as Suica and Pasmo, it is also conveyed to that effect in the poster
The increase in the consumption tax from April 1, 2014 was 100 yen before the hike from June 1, 2006.

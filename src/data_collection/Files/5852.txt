Gaebel was born on 13 January 1975 in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, into a musical family. His younger brother Denis Gäbel plays tenor saxophone in the Tom Gaebel big band. Colin Gäbel is a singer and guitarist in addition to being a TV presenter and reporter about computer games; he is a member of the rock band Mondo Kane. Gaebel started music lessons at an early age. He plays several instruments, including drums, violin, trombone, and piano. During high school, he was a member of bands, including two big bands and a rock band called Goresaw.  He attended the Conservatorium van Amsterdam. In October 2004, he received a major in jazz singing from the Conservatorium. After performing and singing in big bands, such as The Young Sinatras and the Tobias Kremer Big Band, he formed his own group in 2005.
His debut solo album, Introducing: Myself, was released in 2005 and became a best seller. A live DVD, Live in Concert, followed in 2006. His second album, Good Life from 2007, featured more of Gaebel's original numbers. Don't Wanna Dance spotlighted Gaebel expanding his style to pop and soul, with songs influenced by Motown. In 2010, he released two new albums. Music to Watch Girls By focused on the style of late 1960s easy listening ballads and uptempo numbers, and a Christmas album, Easy Christmas, which includes songs for the season written by Gaebel.

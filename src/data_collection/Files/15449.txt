The KTM X-Bow (pronounced crossbow) is an ultra-light sports car for road and race use, produced by Austrian motorcycle manufacturer KTM. It represented the first car in their product range and was launched at the Geneva Motor Show in 2008.

KTM developed the X-Bow in collaboration with Kiska Design, Audi, and Dallara. The X-Bow uses a turbocharged four-cylinder 2.0 litre Audi engine. The 2008 model produces 237 hp (177 kW; 240 PS) at 5,500 rpm and 310 newton metres (230 lb⋅ft) of torque between 2,000 and 5,500 rpm, and can accelerate from 0-62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.9 seconds. Its top speed is 217 km/h (134.9 mph). 
In the 2011 X-Bow R model, the Audi engine is further tuned to produce 300 hp (224 kW; 304 PS) and 400 newton metres (300 lb⋅ft) of torque at 3,300 rpm.Originally, KTM planned a production of 500 units per year; however, the company increased production to 1,000 cars a year and built a new plant near Graz due to high demand.

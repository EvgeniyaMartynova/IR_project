Title: Jeep J8
Aspects: {'J8'}

The Jeep J8 is a military vehicle based on the Jeep Wrangler platform. It is also used in underground mining. The model was introduced at the Defence Systems & Equipment International (DSEi) trade show on September 13, 2007. The J8 is assembled in Egypt and in Israel. AIL markets the vehicle to sectors of the government as the AIL Storm III.
Recently, the J8 has been submitted as a replacement for the Toyota Tacoma, Toyota Hilux, Mitsubishi Triton and HMMWV for US Special Forces.


== Design ==

The J8 is equipped with larger brakes, axles and suspension components than the civilian version and has a payload capacity of 1,339 kilograms (2,952 lb). The J8 also differs from the civilian model by utilizing rear leaf springs. The Jeep J8 is powered by a VM Motori 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine that produces 145 kW (194 hp) and 460 N⋅m (339 lb⋅ft) of torque, providing towing capability of up to 3,500 kilograms (7,716 lb). The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission.  The J8 also features a unique air-intake system with special filtration and a hood-mounted snorkel that enables the J8 to wade in water up to 762 mm (30 in) deep and tackle sandstorm conditions for up to five hours.
Available as a two-door with an extended pickup bed for personnel or equipment transport, or a four-door multipurpose vehicle, it may be produced with numerous vehicle-body and seating configurations in either right-hand- or left-hand-drive.
While not designed for front-line combat operations, the Jeep J8 is fully armour capable (BRV 2009 VR7) and can be used for a variety of duties ranging from command vehicle, troop/cargo carrier, ambulance or communications vehicle.  Heavy-duty bumpers with tow eyes allow the Jeep J8 to be easily transported by fixed wing aircraft or helicopter.


== Production ==
 
The J8 was first planned for assembly at a Chrysler joint-venture facility in Cairo, Egypt. On July 2, 2008, the production version of the Jeep J8 was unveiled at Euro Camp Jeep 2008, a customer event in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.On November 13, 2008, Chrysler LLC and Arab American Vehicles officially announced the manufacturing launch of the Jeep J8 at AAV's assembly plant in Cairo.Jeep J8 is also assembled in Israel, by Automotive Industries Ltd. (AIL) of Nazareth. It is locally badged Storm 3, and will be supplied as a command vehicle to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF). A pair of production J8s was tested by Israeli web magazine Jeepolog.com journalists in April 2009. It was dubbed "probably best Jeep ever". A civilian version was apparently considered for the local Israeli market, but the idea was abandoned.In 2012 a variant of the Storm 3 was introduced by AIL in Israel under the name Storm 3 Type R. According to Israeli Blog Jeepolog.com, this is a door-less, no windshield Jeep J8, running on 35" tires, and sporting metal tube fenders and roll-cage. It is intended for special forces use in the border patrol, pursuit, and deep strike missions.American Expedition Vehicles, a Montana-based Jeep aftermarket parts producer, has struck a deal with Chrysler to sell 120 J8 "component chassis" in the US. These chassis are sold fully assembled but without an engine or transmission. This allows the customer to install or have installed either a 2.8L VM Turbodiesel with 339 lb.-ft. of torque (460 N • m) or a 5.7-liter V-8 Chrysler HEMI. The vehicle can then be legally registered as a "component vehicle".Underground Mining
A special version of the J8 was developed in 2009 by Jeep and VM Motori for the underground mining market.  This version is equipped with a version of the 2.8L VM Turbodiesel that is approved by MSHA and CANMET for use in underground mines.

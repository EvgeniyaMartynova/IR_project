Title: Harbin Z-20
Aspects: {'Z20'}

The Harbin Z-20 is a medium-lift utility helicopter produced by the Harbin Aircraft Industry Group (HAIG), first flight on 23 December 2013.  it has a maximum takeoff weight in the range of 10 tonnes (22,000 lb), can drop troops at locations of up to 3,000 ft (910 m) altitude, and could operate from the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning. It is thought to be comparable to the US-made Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, the civilian Sikorsky S-70C-2 variant of which has been used by the People's Liberation Army since 1984.


== Development ==
The People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) has had a requirement for a high-altitude medium utility helicopter for operations in the mountainous west region since the 1980s. Initially they acquired 24 Sikorsky S-70C-2s with enhanced General Electric T700-701A engines, which gave unmatched performance even in comparison to the Mi-17V5 purchased later. Development of the so-called "10-tonne helicopter project" started in 2006, and the Z-20 made its first flight on 23 December 2013.In addition to the PLAAF, the Z-20 will likely find service throughout the People's Liberation Army. For the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), it could fill the role of a multi-role naval helicopter small enough to be interoperable across all PLAN vessels while still being able to have a full suite of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities installed, something the current Ka-28 and Changhe Z-8/Changhe Z-18 cannot do.


== Design ==
Some sources suggest that the Z-20 is a copy of the Black Hawk  because the Peoples Liberation Army Air force had bought 24  Sikorsky S-70-C2 which the Blackhawk is based on and link the design to the Black Hawk that was abandoned by US special forces in Pakistan during the operation to kill Osama bin Laden on 1 May 2011. The sources say that Pakistan allowed Chinese officials to examine the Black Hawk  wreckage. However, Aviation Week also points out that although some aspects of the design do appear similar, such as the tail wheel arrangement, there are also marked differences. For example, the Chinese Z-20 has a five blade rotor compared with the Black Hawks' four blades.While the Z-20 bears a strong resemblance to the S-70/UH-60 Black Hawk series, there are several key differences including a five-bladed main rotor and more angular tail-to-fuselage joint frame, giving it greater lift, cabin capacity, and endurance than the Black Hawk, as well as a fly-by-wire design. It also has fairings installed aft of the engine exhausts and on the tail spine, which are likely housings for satellite communications or the BeiDou  satellite navigation system. The Z-20 is believed to be powered by the domestic WZ-10 turboshaft engine providing 1,600 kW (about 2,145 shp), compared to the latest GE T700-701D engine that produces 1,500 kW (about 2,011 shp). These features enable it to conduct operations at altitudes up to 4,000 m (13,200 ft).

Title: Fatir
Aspects: {'Q35'}

Fāṭir (فاطر, "Originator"), also known as al-Malāʼikah (ﺍﻟملائكة, "The Angels"), is the 35th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur'an with 45 verses (āyāt).
Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbāb al-nuzūl), it is an earlier "Meccan surah", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.


== Exegesis ==
Abu Hamza al-Thumal recorded from a parchment containing a speech on asceticism given by Imam Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin in which the following verse from Surah Fatir was referenced: (35:28)"Those truly fear Allah, among His Servants who have knowledge: for Allah is Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving." Concerning this verse, Zayn al-Abidin comments that the knowledge, by Allah, and the deeds are nothing but two harmonious matters. The one who recognizes Allah fears him, and the fear urges him to the deeds in obedience to Allah; the heads of knowledge follow him, recognize Allah, and strive to do good deeds.

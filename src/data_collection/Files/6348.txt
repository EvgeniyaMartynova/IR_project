You know the most effective public diplomacy I've seen? It's been basketball...There's a J.D. Walsh right now in basketball, he's a Maryland graduate, he's in India doing this same thing, but he's expanded on the idea. He's using it to also, as they teach basketball, to have HIV/AIDS testing, to teach courses in nonviolent conflict resolution.

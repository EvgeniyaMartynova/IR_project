== Route description ==

SR 22 begins at a tangent intersection with US 250 (Richmond Road) in the community of Shadwell in eastern Albemarle County.  The state highway heads northeast as Louisa Road, a two-lane road that parallels CSX's Piedmont Subdivision and passes under Interstate 64.  The state highway and railroad diverge in the hamlet of Keswick.  SR 22 meets the southern end of SR 231 (Gordonsville Road) in Cismont and crosses over the Piedmont Subdivision rail line in Cobham before entering Louisa County.  The state highway intersects US 15 in the hamlet of Boswells Tavern, also known as Waldrop, and crosses the upper reaches of the South Anna River.SR 22 begins to run concurrently with US 33 (Spotswood Trail) at Trevilians, where the state highway begins to parallel the railroad again.  The two highways enter the town of Louisa as Main Street.  At the east end of the downtown area, SR 22 and US 33 intersect SR 208 (Courthouse Road), which joins the two other highways east a short distance to where US 33 diverges as Jefferson Highway.  SR 22 and SR 208 continue east parallel to the railroad along Davis Highway, which passes to the north of Louisa County Airport.  East of Louisa County High School, the two highways turn south into the town of Mineral, where the two highways follow Piedmont Avenue.  SR 22 reaches its eastern terminus at the highways' intersection with US 522.  US 522 heads south as Mineral Avenue through downtown Mineral.  The northbound direction of the U.S. Highway and SR 208 turn east onto 1st Street, cross the railroad tracks at grade, then turn north on Louisa Avenue to exit the town.

Title: List of Intel Atom microprocessors
Aspects: {'N550'}

The Intel Atom is Intel's line of low-power, low-cost and low-performance x86 and x86-64 microprocessors. Atom, with codenames of Silverthorne and Diamondville, was first announced on March 2, 2008.
For Nettop and Netbook Atom Microprocessors after Diamondville, the memory and graphics controller are moved from the northbridge to the CPU. This explains the drastically increased transistor count for post-Diamondville Atom microprocessors.

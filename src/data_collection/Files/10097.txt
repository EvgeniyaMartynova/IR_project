Title: Rho
Aspects: {'P (disambiguation)'}

Rho (; uppercase Ρ, lowercase ρ or ϱ; Greek: ῥῶ) is the 17th letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 100. It is derived from Phoenician letter res . Its uppercase form uses the same glyph, Ρ, as the distinct Latin letter P; the two letters have different Unicode encodings.


== Uses ==


=== Greek ===
Rho is classed as a liquid consonant (together with lambda and sometimes the nasals mu and nu), which has important implications for morphology. In both Ancient and Modern Greek, it represents a trilled or tapped r.
In polytonic orthography, a rho at the beginning of a word is written with a rough breathing, equivalent to h (ῥ rh), and a double rho within a word is written with a smooth breathing over the first rho and a rough breathing over the second (ῤῥ rrh). That apparently reflected an aspirated or voiceless pronunciation in Ancient Greek, which led to the various Greek-derived English words starting with rh or contain rrh.
The name of the letter is written in Greek as ῥῶ (polytonic) or ρω/ρο (monotonic).


=== Other alphabets ===
Letters that arose from rho include Roman R and Cyrillic Er (Р).


=== Mathematics and science ===
The characters ρ and ϱ are also conventionally used outside the Greek alphabetical context in science and mathematics.

    {\displaystyle \varrho }
  ) (note: \Rho is not defined by default)

=== Chi Rho ===
The letter rho overlaid with chi forms the Chi Rho symbol, used to represent Jesus Christ.


=== Rhodes Scholars ===
Former Rhodes Scholars are entitled to use the Greek letter rho as a designation of their status.  When used, the symbol should precede the name.

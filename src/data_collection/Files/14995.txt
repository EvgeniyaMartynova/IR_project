Title: W50 (nebula)
Aspects: {'W50'}

W50 or SNR G039.7-02.0, once referred to as the Manatee Nebula,  is a Supernova remnant located in the constellation Aquila, about 18,000 light years away. In its centre lies the micro-quasar SS 433, whose jets are distorting the remnant's shell. Most likely W50 and SS 433 are related objects, remnants from a supernova which occurred about 20,000 years ago.

Title: Ginetta Junior Championship
Aspects: {'G20 (disambiguation)'}

The Ginetta Junior Championship is a one-make racing series based in the United Kingdom. From the 2010 season teams will use the Ginetta G40, having previously used the Ginetta G20.
The cars use sealed Ford Zetec 1.8-litre engines, and feature tubular steel chassis, fully integral FIA approved roll cages and fibre-glass shells which ensure safe, controlled racing.


== Race weekend ==
Meetings are usually made up of two 15-minute races. The starting grids for the two races are determined by a 15-minute qualifying session. Each driver's fastest lap in this session sets their starting position for the first race, whilst their second fastest lap sets their starting position for race two.

The common shiner can be found in cool clear creeks and small to medium rivers, usually in the faster pools near riffles and in the shallow littoral of ponds and lakes. Its preferred water temperature is 21.9 °C.
The common shiner reaches sexual maturity by 1–2 years of age, and produces between 400 and 4000 eggs per year. Common shiners spawn in spring between May and June, at temperatures of 16-26 °C. Common shiners often spawn over the nest of a creek chub, river chub, or fallfish, although some males will make their own small nests. Gravel in riffles is also possible. Once the eggs are ready the male guards the nesting site.Common shiners are known to hybridize with other shiner species.Common shiners live for about 5–7 years.

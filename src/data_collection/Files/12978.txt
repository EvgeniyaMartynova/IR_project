The song peaked in the top 20 of the US Billboard Hot 100, and had acquired 235 million YouTube views and 240 million Spotify plays by January 2018.
Music critic Simon Reynolds praised "T-Shirt" as "vocal alchemy via Auto-Tune, turning profane tales of fast lane life into a holy trance, a choral weave of glistening rap, ecstatic ad libs, and a wordless backing ripple of Gregorian gurgles and droning moans."

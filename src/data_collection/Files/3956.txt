Title: Alacrite
Aspects: {'F90'}

Alacrite (also known as L-605, Cobalt L-605, Haynes 25, and occasionally F90) is a family of cobalt-based alloys. The alloy exhibits useful mechanical properties and is oxidation- and sulfidation-resistant.One member of the family, XSH Alacrite, is described as "a non-magnetic, stainless super-alloy whose high surface hardness enables one to achieve a mirror quality polish." Originally developed for manufacturing aircraft components, L-605 has also been used in aerospace components and turbine engines as well as drug-eluting and other kinds of stents due to its biocompatibility. The Institut National de MÃ©trologie in France has also used the material as a kilogram mass standard.


== Composition and standardization ==
L-605 is composed primarily of cobalt (Co), with a specified mixture of chromium (Cr), tungsten (W), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe) and carbon (C), as well as small amounts of manganese (Mn), silicon (Si), and phosphorus (P). The tungsten and nickel improve the alloy's machinability, while chromium contributes to its solid-solution strengthening. The following tolerances must be met to be considered an L-605 alloy:
When used for implantable medical devices, the ASTM F90-09 and ISO 5832-5:2005 specifications dictate how L-605 is manufactured and tested.

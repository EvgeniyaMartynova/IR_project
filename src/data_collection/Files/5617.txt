Title: Gap Band IV
Aspects: {"I Can't Get Over You"}

Gap Band IV is the sixth album (contrary to the title) by The Gap Band, released in 1982 on Total Experience Records. The album reached #1 on the Black Albums chart and #14 on the Pop Albums chart, achieved platinum status, and is considered their most successful project. 
The album produced the singles "Early in the Morning" (#1 Black Singles, #13 Club Play Singles, #24 Pop Singles), "You Dropped a Bomb on Me" (#2 Black Singles, #39 Club Play Singles, #31 Pop Singles), and "Outstanding" (#1 Black Singles, #24 Club Play Singles, #51 Pop Singles). It also achieved a rare feat in which every song on the album received radio airplay.
This was the first album producer Lonnie Simmons released directly on his label, Total Experience Records. The album was later reissued on CD in 1994 by Mercury Records.

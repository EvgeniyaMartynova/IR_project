Aspects: {'J. T. Thomas'}

Forq is an American jazz fusion band from New York and Texas.


== History ==
Forq was co-founded by keyboardist Henry Hey and Snarky Puppy member, bassist Michael League.  The original formation of the band included guitarist Adam Rogers, and drummer Jason "JT" Thomas. Hey, a founding  member of the band Rudder, had played a few Rudder shows, sharing the bill with Snarky Puppy before suggesting a collaboration with League, starting with a few live shows in New York City. The group's debut self-titled album was released on Snarky Puppy's label, GroundUP Music, in 2014. Rogers left the group and was replaced by Snarky Puppy guitarist Chris McQueen early in 2015 prior to a tour of Europe. The group's sophomore album, Batch, was issued in June 2015. The group played at Snarky Puppy's GroundUp Festival in February 2017 and released a third album, Threq, in mid-2017. Since the release of Threq, bassist Michael League has been replaced by bassist Kevin Scott.

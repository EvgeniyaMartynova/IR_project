Die geilste Single der Welt (German for The Horniest Single in the World or The Coolest Single in the World) is a song by German eurodance group E-Rotic. It is the first single from their "Greatest Hits"-Compilation Greatest Tits. It is a megamix including "Fred Come to Bed", "Willy Use A Billy... Boy", "Fritz Love My Tits", "Sex on the Phone" and "Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex".

== Reception ==
After completing their test of the new camera, the Digital Photography Review web site provided this conclusion: "The Nikon Z7 ... is also its most well-rounded camera for stills and video, and an exciting indicator for what's to come from the 101 year-old company. But first generation products are rarely perfect, and the Nikon Z7 is no exception". The overall score was 89%.
The positive specifics were briefly stated: "the camera feels, handles, and operates like a smaller, lighter full-frame Nikon DSLR - from button placement to menu layout, to the robustness of the build quality and the comfort of the grip. But there are some small differences, namely in the way the AF system operates. It is also the first Nikon full-framer with a truly useful silent shutter and mechanical in-body stabilization. On the cinema side it offers a wide variety of 4K video capture options that should satisfy both home-movie-makers and advanced videographers alike, but possibly not established professionals".
The site provided this summary of the less positive aspects: "the Z7 technically offers the same calculated Raw dynamic range as the D850, on sensor AF points lead to banding/striping which limits usable DR [dynamic range]. Autofocus, while reliable in good light, hunts more than we'd like as light levels drop. And AF tracking as a whole lags behind the competition, as well as Nikon's own full-frame DSLRs, both in terms of reliability and usability".

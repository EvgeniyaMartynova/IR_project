Title: 85 Sky Tower
Aspects: {'T&C'}

85 Sky Tower, formerly known as the T & C Tower or Tuntex Sky Tower (Chinese: 高雄85大樓; pinyin: Gāoxióng 85 Dàlóu; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Ko-hiông 85 Tōa-lâu), is an 85-story skyscraper in Lingya District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The structure is 347.5 m (1,140 ft) high. An antenna increases the pinnacle height to 378 m (1,240 ft). Constructed from 1994 to 1997, it is the tallest skyscraper in Kaohsiung, and was the tallest in Taiwan until the completion of Taipei 101 in 2004.
There is no 44th floor in the building (see Tetraphobia); the 43rd floor connects directly to the 45th floor. The pyramid shaped crown is the equivalent of three stories high and is hence marketed as 83-85 to arrive at a round number. There is no elevator access to floors above 80. 
The building was designed by C.Y. Lee & Partners and Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, and has an unusual 'prong' design with two separate 39-floor sections, which merge into a single central tower rising to a spire. This unique design leaves a substantial space below the central part of the tower. The design was inspired by the first Kanji and Chinese character of the city's name (changed to Takao (Japanese: 高雄) during Japanese rule). John W. Milton was Project Director on behalf of Turner International Inc. (New York), a subsidiary of Turner Construction.
The building was owned by the now defunct Tuntex Group, and is mainly offices, but includes residential space, and a department store; and the 85 Sky Tower Hotel occupies the 38th to 70th floors. An observation deck on the 74th floor offers views over Kaohsiung City, the Love River and the Kaohsiung Harbour, and it is accessed by high speed elevators that are capable of speeds of 10.17 m/s.


== Occupancy ==
Floor 34 and 35 are currently leased by Look Hotel Group (Chinese: 樂活商旅租). The 85 Sky Tower Hotel (Chinese: 君鴻國際酒店) occupies floors 37 to 85, and it owns the observation deck. Office space and studio apartments occupy each side of the lower floors.


== Atrium ==
There is an Atrium that extends from Level 45's Shimmer Ballroom (as of 2015 the entire floor is dark and unoccupied) to Level 83; it is one of the highest continuous atriums in the world.

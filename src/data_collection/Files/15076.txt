Title: Hoeksche Waard
Aspects: {'Waard'}

The Hoekse Waard (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɦuksə ˈʋaːrt]; pre-1947 spelling: Hoeksche Waard) is an island between the Oude Maas, Dordtsche Kil, Hollands Diep, Haringvliet and Spui rivers in the province of Zuid Holland in the Netherlands. The island, part of the namesake municipality of Hoeksche Waard, is a mostly agricultural region, south of Rotterdam. The Hoeksche Waard consists of reclaimed land (polders): after the Saint Elisabeth flood of 1421 most of the area was flooded. The land has been reclaimed gradually in the following centuries.

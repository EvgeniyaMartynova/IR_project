== Writing and recording ==
After Nash wrote and composed the original version, he recorded it in London with members of the Fabulous Five Inc., and produced it himself. Its arrangements and style are both heavily laced with reggae influences. Nash had collaborated with Bob Marley in the past, and his approach drew strongly from Marley's reggae style.

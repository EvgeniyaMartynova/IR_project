Title: Phalaenopsis gigantea
Aspects: {'P. gigantea'}

Phalaenopsis gigantea is named for the giant size of its leaves, which can grown over 2 feet in length on a mature plant.  This orchid is endemic to Borneo and was first described in 1909. It is the largest known Phalaenopsis species.


== Species Description ==

A very short monopodial stem with 5-6 large silvery-green pendent leaves that can measure over 60 cm across
flowers are ~5 cm across (up to 6.5 cm), cream background with raised red-brown spots, and varying degrees of green around the column, waxy
Mature, specimen-size plants are capable of producing hundreds of flowers on pendent, branching inflorescences reaching 40 centimeters
blooms have sweetly fragrant citrus scent
flowers can last many months
inflorescence can rebloom over many seasons 
Although widespread belief that this orchid takes anywhere from 8 to 12 years for a seedling to reach flowering size, it may be possible to flower seedlings in 4 years with ideal culture 


== Species variants ==
Phal. gigantea var aurea: has a brighter yellow background color throughout the sepals and petals 


== Growing Conditions ==
warm to hot growing orchid
although not difficult to grow, (gigantea) seedlings take significantly longer to reach maturity than other species
particularly susceptible to rot if water gets trapped between the leaves
allow potting media to dry out completely between watering
Phal. gigantea needs its entire root system to keep the large leaves hydrated, so as a result is very sensitive to getting its roots disrupted
prefers higher light than most phalaenopsis

Title: Chase YCG-14
Aspects: {'G14'}

The Chase CG-14, also known as the G-14 or Model MS.1, was an assault glider manufactured by Chase Aircraft for the United States Army Air Forces during the Second World War. The aircraft failed to progress beyond the prototype stage, being overtaken by larger, improved glider designs.


== Design and development ==
The first aircraft to be developed by Chase after its founding in 1943, the CG-14 was developed in preference to the Laister-Kauffman CG-10. Constructed from marine-grade mahogany, as spruce wood was being used by the war effort in higher priority projects, the XG-14 featured improved crash protection when compared to preceding gliders.


== Operational history ==
The XCG-14 made its maiden flight on January 4, 1945, and following successful flight trials the aircraft was developed into two improved versions, the wood-and-metal XCG-14A and the enlarged YCG-14A.The CG-14 was one of the few glider projects to be continued after the end of the war; however, it was quickly superseded by an improved aircraft, the XCG-18.

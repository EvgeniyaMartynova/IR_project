== History ==

KHTT was originally KMMM, and it was also known as "K-Triple M" (the three Ms in its call letters, which also stood for "Muskogee's Music Machine") and at times it was called "The New K107 FM". It targeted only Muskogee and the surrounding areas at the time. Very little format history is known for KMMM; one of the formats known for the station is urban contemporary. The station mixed in a few top 40 songs during the daytime and aired a straight ahead Urban presentation by evenings. By 1982 KMMM went dark.
In 1982, the station signed back on the air with an upgrade in its signal now allowing it to target Tulsa. It changed its format to a full length Top 40/CHR format and became known as KAYI but still kept the moniker as "K107 FM". In the early 90s, KAYI evolved in an Adult CHR direction, but the change did not bring success. In November 1993, the station changed its call letters to KHTT and its slogan to "K-HITS." It remained an adult-leaning top 40 station for a few more years. Then in the summer of 1996, "K-HITS" shifted to a more mainstream top 40 format, which it has since used with an astounding success.

== Gunman ==
On Jan. 13, 2010 just after 1PM, 58-year-old Barry Styles brought a gun to the offices of KHTT and sister station KBEZ, and walked up and down the hallways demanding to speak to KBEZ morning show DJ Carly Rush. When the receptionist informed the man she had left for the day, he walked out of the office then immediately returned brandishing a pistol. The receptionist escaped to the back of the office and called the Tulsa Police Department. The gunman trapped the employees inside the office and guarded the exit. After approximately 10 minutes, the police department had arrived on scene. When the gunman refused to drop his weapon, police fired shots hitting him in the waist. Shortly after, the police handcuffed the man and he was taken to a hospital where he was listed as being in serious condition.

Title: Austin Independent School District
Aspects: {'Oak Hill Elementary'}

Austin Independent School District is a school district based in the city of Austin, Texas, United States. Established in 1881, the district serves most of the City of Austin and surrounding towns, the City of Sunset Valley, the Village of San Leanna, and unincorporated areas in Travis County (including Manchaca). The district operates 129 schools including 84 elementary schools, 19 middle schools, and 17 high schools.
As of 2013 AISD covers 172.4 square miles (447 km2) of land within the City of Austin, making up 54.1% of the city's territory.


== Academic achievement ==
In 2011, the school district was rated "academically acceptable" by the Texas Education Agency. Forty-nine percent of districts in Texas in 2011 received the same rating. No state accountability ratings will be given to districts in 2012. A school district in Texas can receive one of four possible rankings from the Texas Education Agency: Exemplary (the highest possible ranking), Recognized, Academically Acceptable, and Academically Unacceptable (the lowest possible ranking).

== Finances ==
Like other Texas public school districts, AISD is funded through a combination of local property taxes, general state revenues (such as occupation taxes, Texas Lottery profits, and returns from the Permanent School Fund), and federal education funds. The district also funds some facilities construction and improvements through the issuance of debt by bond elections; AISD's most recent bond election was in 2017.

== Demographics ==
In the 1970s white flight to Westlake and other suburbs of Austin that were majority white began. In 1970 the student body of AISD was 65% non-Hispanic (Anglo) white. In the late 1970s the student body was 57% non-Hispanic white, 26% Hispanic and Latino, and 15% African-American. Until 1978 AISD categorized Hispanics and Latinos as "white" so they could integrate them with African-Americans while leaving non-Hispanic whites out of integration. That year it was forced to integrate Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites. In 2000 the student body of AISD was 37% non-Hispanic white. The Hispanic student population peaked in 2011, at 52,398 students. As of the 2016-17 school year, there are 48,386 Hispanic students, 22,761 non-Hispanic white students, and 6,578 African-American students.

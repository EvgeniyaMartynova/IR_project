Title: University of Baltimore School of Law
Aspects: {'UB Law'}

The University of Baltimore School of Law, or the UB School of Law, is one of the four colleges that make up the University of Baltimore, which is part of the University System of Maryland. The UB School of Law is one of only two law schools in the state of Maryland, with the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law; both are located in downtown Baltimore. The University of Baltimore School of Law is housed in the new John and Frances Angelos Law Center, at the northeast corner of West Mount Royal Avenue and North Charles Street on the University of Baltimore campus in the city's Mt. Vernon cultural district. The 12-story building, designed by German architect Stefan Behnisch, opened in April 2013 and was rated LEED Platinum by the U.S. Green Building Council.


== History ==
The School of Law was founded in 1925 as part of the then-private, nonprofit University of Baltimore, with the first class of 38 students receiving diplomas in 1928. Created initially to serve the working population of the Baltimore area with a part-time evening program, the school added a full-time day division in 1969. In September 1970, the University of Baltimore School of Law merged with Eastern College and its Mount Vernon School of Law, which was founded in 1935. On Jan. 1, 1975, the school became a public institution when the University of Baltimore joined the State of Maryland's system for public higher education.
An alumni body of approximately 13,000 includes many prominent figures, including Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles; Maryland's former first lady, the Hon. Catherine Curran O'Malley; Thomas Condon, widely considered the most powerful agent in professional football; and U.S. Rep. C.A. "Dutch" Ruppersberger III. More than one-third of Maryland's sitting judges are UB School of Law graduates, and the number of University of Baltimore law alumni who serve as Maryland elected officials is second only to that of the University of Maryland, College Park. The John and Frances Angelos Law Center offers 192,000 square feet of space and is among the most environmentally sustainable academic buildings in the nation. This 12-story facility, located on the northeast corner of the intersection of North Charles Street and West Mount Royal Avenue, houses all of the school's clinics, centers and classrooms and affords students countless options for indoor and outdoor study.


== Post-graduation employment and academics ==


=== Employment outcomes ===
Of Class of 2017 graduates, 67.3% found employment in positions for which bar admission was required. An additional 13.8% of the Class of 2017 found employment in positions for which a J.D. was required or preferred by the employer. (Of 222 graduates, 96.9% reported their employment status.) Nearly 33% of graduates -- 32.7% -- secured judicial clerkships.


=== Costs ===
The School of Law's total cost for full-time attendance (tuition and fees) is $31,954 in-state and $46,622 out-of-state for the 2018-2019 academic year. Students in Washington, D.C., and certain areas of Pennsylvania, Delaware and northern Virginia are eligible to receive Maryland in-state tuition.


=== Degrees and concentrations ===
The University of Baltimore School of Law produces many of the leading lights of Maryland's legal community -- practitioners, judges, public defenders, prosecutors, scholars and community and civic advocates. More than one-third of judges on the Maryland state bench are UB alumni. The UB School of  Law offers the juris doctor (J.D.) degree and master's degrees (LL.M.) in tax and U.S. law. The school offers several concentrations for J.D. students, including:

Business Law
Criminal Practice
Estate Planning
Family Law
Intellectual Property
International & Comparative Law
Litigation & Advocacy
Public and Governmental Service
Real Estate Practice
Tax LawIn conjunction with the law school's and University's other programs and schools, the law school offers joint degree combinations of JD/MBA, JD/MPA, JD/MS in criminal justice, JD/MS in negotiations and conflict management, JD/Ph.D. in policy science and JD/LL.M. in taxation.


=== The Law Center ===
Former UB President Robert L. Bogomolny called for a path-breaking building that would provide a strong foundation for activities central to the School of Law's mission: community involvement, public interest, diversity. "As an educational institution, we envision a building whose design teaches critical lessons about how to create and sustain healthy urban environments," Bogomolny said before construction began in 2010. "As an institution committed to excellence, we envision a signature building whose materials reflect the quality of our aspirations." In support of these requirements, the Abell Foundation funded a $150,000 design competition for the new facility, a move that brought national and international interest to the project. On Nov. 17, 2008, UB announced that Behnisch Architekten of Stuttgart, Germany, in partnership with Baltimore's Ayers/Saint/Gross Inc., won the international competition to design the new John and Frances Angelos Law Center at UB. Of the winning design, Bogomolny said: "Stefan Behnisch has articulated an initial concept for our new law center that is truly forward-thinking. Stefan's ideas about sustainable design and his creativity in responding to the evolving needs of higher education place him in the forefront of 21st-century architecture."
The building, rated LEED Platinum by the U.S. Green Building Council, features innovative air-handling systems and the active capture of light and water that would otherwise go to waste.


=== Centers & Clinics ===
UB is home to six law centers: Sayra and Neil Meyerhoff Center for Families, Children and the Courts; Center for International and Comparative Law; Center on Applied Feminism; Center for Sport and the Law; Center for Medicine and the Law, and Center for the Law of Intellectual Property and Technology. The School of Law has 13 clinics: Saul Ewing Civil Advocacy Clinic, Community Development Clinic, Criminal Practice Clinic, Juvenile Justice Project, Human Trafficking Prevention Project, Mental Health Law Clinic, Bronfein Family Law Clinic, Immigrant Rights Clinic, Innocence Project Clinic, Pretrial Justice Clinic, Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic, The Bob Parsons Veterans Advocacy Clinic, and the Mediation Clinic for Families. All of the University of Baltimore School of Law clinics and centers are housed in the John and Frances Angelos Law Center.
The University of Baltimore School of Law annually provides nearly 200 students the opportunity to participate in a broad range of clinical programs and externships. These programs provide both day and evening students a broad range of experiential learning opportunities as licensed student-attorneys (clinics) and closely supervised law clerks (externships).
While students in the clinical program at the University of Baltimore School of Law receive unmatched, real-life practical experience, they also generate significant results that benefit the Baltimore region and Maryland as a whole. In addition, the school's proximity to Washington, D.C., allows students to participate in externships in a wide range of governmental, public-interest and private-sector placements. Clinics represent, on average, 200 low-income clients every year, including adults, children, neighborhood associations and other nonprofit organizations.
Under the supervision of faculty, most clinics allow students to provide the full range of representation to clients. Clinic work includes interviewing, counseling, planning case strategy and appearing in court or before administrative agencies. Certain clinics, such as the Community Development Clinic, provide experience in transactional work.
Finally, most clinics also allow students to engage in more systemic work, including drafting and testifying in support of legislation and participating in state and national task forces on issues such as child neglect, domestic violence, protection for consumers and the promotion of affordable housing.
The clinic facility is run as a law office with a teaching and a public-service mission.

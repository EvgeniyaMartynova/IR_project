Title: V14 engine
Aspects: {'V14'}

A V14 engine is a V engine with 14 cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two banks of seven. It is a relatively rare layout, which is used on large medium-speed diesel engines used for power generation and marine propulsion.


== Marine use ==
MAN B&W offers V14 layout for all its current medium-speed diesel engines except V28-33D and L58-64, with output ranging from 7,000 to 16,800 kW (9,400 to 22,500 hp). MAN V14 engines have been installed for example on Explorer Dream and Norwegian Spirit, both of which are powered by four 14V48/60 generating sets producing 14,700 kW (19,700 hp) each. However, other major manufacturers do not normally offer medium-speed engines in V14 configuration. Wärtsilä has only recently begun to offer V14 versions of its latest engine models, 31 and 46DF.In the past, V14 engines have also been offered by other manufacturers. In 1982–1987 nineteen SA-15 class arctic cargo ships were built with two 14-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14ZV40/48 engines producing 7,700 kW (10,300 hp). SEMT Pielstick, nowadays part of MAN B&W, also produced four-stroke engines with 14 cylinders in V-configuration (14PC2 and 14PC4). They were used for example on RFA Bayleaf, a Leaf-class support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

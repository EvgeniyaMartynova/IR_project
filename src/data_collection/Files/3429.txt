Title: F (Los Angeles Railway)
Aspects: {'F Line'}

F was a line operated by the Los Angeles Railway from 1911 to 1956.


== History ==


=== Fourth Street Line (1898-1911) ===
The Fourth Street Line was originally built by the Los Angeles Traction Company and opened in 1898. This route ran from a Downtown terminus at 3rd Street and Stephenson Avenue (present-day Traction Avenue) to 1st Street by way of Boyle Heights by way of Stephenson, Merrick Street, 4th Street, and Fresno Street.
In 1910, the LAIU was taken over by the Pacific Electric Railway who ran it as a local line for one year, extending the route to 4th and Hill by way of 3rd and Hill Streets.


=== Sunnyside Division (1888-1911) ===
The Sunnyside Division was the second division to be built by the Los Angeles and Redondo Railway, the world's first suburban railway. From the LA&R terminus at 2nd and Spring Streets, the Sunnyside Line ran to Redondo Beach by way of 2nd Street, Broadway, 7th Street, Grand Avenue, Santa Barbara Avenue, Sunnyside Avenue (present-day South Hoover), a private right of way between 69th Street and Florence Avenue, Vermont Avenue, 166th Street, Redondo Beach Boulevard, Ripley Avenue, and Anita Street.
During the Great Merger of 1911, the southern portion of the LA&R was incorporated into the Pacific Electric Railway, while the northern portion became local routes of the Los Angeles Railway. At this point, the Fourth Street and Sunnyside Lines were merged into a single route.


=== F Line (1911-1956) ===
LARy streamlined the Fourth Street and Sunnyside Lines, avoiding Stephenson Avenue entirely and running the Downtown segment through Main Street. The new route followed Fresno Street, 4th Street, Main Street, Jefferson Boulevard, Grand Avenue, Hoover Avenue, a private right of way, and Vermont Avenue, terminating at Manchester Avenue, where a less frequent shuttle could be taken to the Pacific Electric's Delta Station. In 1920, the shuttle was eliminated; the main line ran all the way to Delta and was renamed "F."


==== After Union Station ====
The opening of Union Station in 1939 resulted in the creation of a loop segment on the building's north side, which served as the new northern terminus for the line. The 4th street track was eliminated, and the new loop connected to the remainder of the route by way of Macy Street and Main Street. The southern terminus was also cut back to the intersection of Vermont Avenue and Manchester Avenue. In 1950, the Hoover section was eliminated, and the F car ran straight from Santa Barbara to Vermont Avenues.
In 1956, the F Line was the last route to be removed by Los Angeles Transit Lines, although it had long been one of the least used routes in the system.

Title: White-winged tanager
Aspects: {'P. leucoptera'}

The white-winged tanager (Piranga leucoptera) is a medium-sized American songbird. Formerly placed in the tanager family (Thraupidae), it and other members of its genus are now classified in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). The species' plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family. Along with the red-headed tanager and red-hooded tanager, it is sometimes placed in the genus Spermagra.
This bird is about 12.2-15 centimeters (4.8-5.9 inches) long and weighs about 13-14.5 grams (0.46-0.51 ounces). The male is mostly red, with black wings and white wing bars. The female is dull olive-yellow but retains the black wings and white wing bars. Juvenile is similar to female.
It is found in Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.

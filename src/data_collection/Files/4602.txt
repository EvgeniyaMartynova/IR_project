The seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series consists of the BMW G20 (sedan version) and BMW G21 (wagon version, marketed as 'Touring') compact executive cars. The G20/G21 has been in production since 2019 and is often collectively referred to as the G20. 
The G20 was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show on October 2, 2018, and released in March 2019.The M340i, one of the first models in the range became available for sale in the spring of 2019, with the 330e hybrid model scheduled for launch in 2020. The 3 Series Gran Turismo fastback body style was discontinued for the G20 generation.


== Development and launch ==
The G20 3 Series is based on the Cluster Architecture (CLAR) platform and features increased use of high-strength steel and aluminium. The G20 has a double-wishbone front suspension and multi-link rear suspension, with a hydraulic damping system to better absorb impacts.The G20 has a flat and covered underbody, resulting in a reduced drag coefficient from 0.26 Cd to 0.23 Cd for the 320d. Compared to its predecessor, the G20 is 55 kg (121 lb) lighter, 85 mm (3.3 in) longer, and 16 mm (0.6 in) wider. The car retains a 50:50 weight distribution and has a 50% increase in body rigidity. Boot capacity is identical to the F30, at 480 litres (17 cu ft).The windshield uses double-glazed acoustic glass and the A-pillars have increased insulation. The handbrake is now electronically operated and no longer uses a manual lever. Engine coasting is also now available in both Eco Pro and Comfort modes, and both petrol and diesel models receive engine particulate filters.In November 2015, a final design proposal out of 3 total, was chosen by BMW management, as reported by Auto Bild in October 2015.The 320d and M340i are available in both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive (xDrive) variants.The Touring variant (G21) was launched on 12 June 2019.

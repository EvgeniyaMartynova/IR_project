Title: Hirth F-23
Aspects: {'F23'}

The Hirth F-23 is a twin cylinder, horizontally-opposed, two stroke, carburetted or optionally fuel injected aircraft engine designed for use on ultralight aircraft.


== Development ==
The F-23 is intended to compete with the 50 hp (37 kW) Rotax 503 and is differentiated from the Rotax powerplant by offering a horizontally-opposed cylinder layout. The F-23 uses free air cooling and piston-ported induction, with dual Bing 34mm slide or optional diaphragm type carburetors. The cylinder walls are electrochemically coated with Nikasil. Standard starting is recoil start. A belt reduction drive system, fuel injection, tuned exhaust and electric start are optional.The engine runs on a 50:1 pre-mix of unleaded 93 octane auto fuel and oil. Recommended time between overhauls is 1000 hours.The F-23 produces 50 hp (37 kW) at 6150 rpm and 40 hp (30 kW) at 5500 rpm.

Title: MTR CNR Changchun EMU
Aspects: {'S Train'}

The Changchun EMU or CNR Changchun EMU is an electric multiple unit train type of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system in Hong Kong. It is designed and manufactured by Changchun Railway Vehicles, a member of CNR group (now part of CRRC Corporation). They were the first MTR heavy-rail stock to be manufactured in Mainland China, while past orders came from England, Japan, Europe or South Korea.
The trains come in two versions: the C-Train, a manned eight-car train which is used mainly on the Kwun Tong line; and the S-Train, a driverless three-car variant which operates on the South Island line since its opening in December 2016. Similar trains have been ordered for the future East West Corridor, also known as EWL C-Train, which entered service on the Ma On Shan line on 12 March 2017; however, these trains bear a resemblance to the older SP1900 EMUs.


== History ==
Designed in 18 months, the first C-Train rolled off the production lines at CNR's plant on 6 December 2010. It was transported to Hong Kong on 28 April 2011. By 16 October, 4 sets had arrived and were undergoing testing on the Kwun Tong Line, where were first expected enter service sometime in November of the same year.On 22 July 2011, MTR ordered 12 eight-car C-trains to increase the urban line fleet for the West Island Line extension and 10 three-car S-Trains for the first phase of the South Island Line.The first C-Train entered service on the Kwun Tong Line on Wednesday, 7 December 2011 in the evening. They were introduced on 29 May 2012 to the Tsuen Wan Line and on 13 May 2013 to the Tseung Kwan O Line. The last of the 8-car trains was handed over on 5 September 2013, and entered service on the Kwun Tong Line shortly after.The S-Trains began operating on 28 December 2016, the day the South Island Line commenced service.


== Train configurations ==


=== Kwun Tong line (contract number C6554-07E - 22 sets) ===


=== South Island line (contract number C6554-12E - 10 sets) ===
In this configuration, the pantograph is situated on the end cars (A car), while all three cars will have a motor each (no trailer cars). Like the converted M-Trains used on the Disneyland Resort line, these trains are fully automated, but unlike the DRL trains, the driver's cab has been replaced by extra passenger space, with an unobstructed view out the front windows (similar to that of the HKIA automated people mover). However, every train has at least one staff for patrol in the traffic hour who able to control the train manually because of the requirement of the Fire Services Department since its commencement. The trains feature a different interior compared to the Kwun Tong Line configuration as well as a different paint scheme and headlight styling. Designed in sixteen months, all ten three-car trains are now in service.

I Live Alone is recognized as one of the "Real-Variety" shows in Korean television. The program is unscripted using documentary techniques with variety show elements, which follows the format of other reality television programs such as Infinite Challenge, which airs on the  same network.  
Every Friday night, this program plays footage from selected Rainbow Club members' everyday lives, both in and out of their homes. As proclaimed on its official homepage, there are about 5 million singles in South Korea and about one-third of South Korean entertainers are not in a relationship. This program shows viewers how single celebrities live, and has attained great popularity due to the relatability of the single lifestyles of various celebrities, which are shown without significant filtering.
Since its inception, each host of the program has gathered other celebrity guests to form a club called the Rainbow Club (Korean: 무지개; RR: Mujigae).

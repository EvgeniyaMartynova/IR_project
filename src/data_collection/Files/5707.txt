Title: I Could Be the One (Stacie Orrico song)
Aspects: {'I Could Be the One (disambiguation)'}

"I Could Be the One" is the fourth and final mainstream single from Stacie Orrico's self-titled second album. It was a limited release (only being released to radio stations in the UK and Poland). It did not fare as well as the first three singles but nonetheless became her fourth top 40 hit in the UK.


== Music video ==
The video for the song was done in the same vein as the "Stuck" video which was also directed by Diane Martel and also featured Orrico's cousin, actor Trevor Wright. The version of the song in the video was slightly longer to the one that appeared on the album, with an extra chorus between the breakdown and third verse. This version, however, has never been commercially available.

Title: General Electric J73
Aspects: {'J73 (disambiguation)'}

The General Electric J73 turbojet was developed by General Electric from the earlier J47 engine. Its original USAF designation was J47-21, but with innovative features including variable inlet guide vanes, double-shell (inner and outer) combustor case, and 50% greater airflow was redesignated J73. Its only use was in the North American F-86H.


== Design and development ==
An engine, uprated from the J47, was required for the F-86H. The mass flow was increased by relocating accessories from the centre of the compressor inlet to the underside of the engine. This allowed a reduction in blade hub diameter, which together with an increase in tip diameter, gave a bigger area for air to enter the compressor. The area through the combustion chambers also had to be increased.This was done by replacing the multiple individual chambers with a single annular casing with individual flame tubes or cans known as cannular.The pressure ratio was increased and variable inlet guide vanes fitted to prevent low-RPM problems (rotating stall/blade flutter) with the higher design pressure ratio. A 2-stage turbine was required.A low boost (10% at take-off) afterburner was fitted. It was known as a tailpipe augmentation (TPA) system.

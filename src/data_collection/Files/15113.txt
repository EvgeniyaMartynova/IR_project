== Legislative history ==
On 13 November 2017,  the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, announced plans for a new Bill to enshrine the Withdrawal Agreement, if any, between the UK and the EU in domestic law by primary legislation. Upon further questioning in the House of Commons, Davis clarified that if MPs chose not to pass the bill, the UK would remain on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 without a deal as a consequence of invoking Article 50 in March 2017, after the passing of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017.Described by The Independent as the government "caving in" to Tory rebels, the new bill would allow MPs to scrutinise any agreement "line-by-line", as well as make amendments. Conservative MP, Steve Baker, writing for The Times, claimed the new bill "gives whatever deal we strike with the EU proper standing in British law" and that it was consistent with the referendum result, in providing "more control over how we are governed to the UK Parliament."

== Music video ==
The video consists of the same scene of Akon getting out of a Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé and seeing a girl he likes. The first time he ignores the girl and walks into the club. He then arrives at another club and sees the girl for a second time and attempts to talk to her, but she is with another man. On the third attempt he is successful and walks home with the girl, entering her house with her. The chorus scenes involve Akon standing while T-Pain playing the piano, with a white Lamborghini Murciélago in the background.

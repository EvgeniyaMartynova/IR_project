Title: Ross R-6
Aspects: {'R6'}

The Ross R-6 is a tandem two-seat, high-wing glider that was designed by Harland Ross and first flown in 1956.


== Design and development ==
Ross designed the R-6 as a two-seat sailplane with the intention of setting new multi-place records with it. The aircraft was initially designed to use the same 55 ft (16.8 m) span wing as the highly successful Ross-Johnson RJ-5, but with a gross weight of 1,226 lb (556 kg) as opposed to the RJ-5's 850 lb (386 kg) this gave the R-6 one of the highest wing loadings for a glider of its day.The R-6 was constructed with a metal fuselage, which was a departure from Ross's earlier designs. The passenger seat is behind the pilot's seat, aft of the wing spar and has no windows, visibility is provided by a removable plastic overhead dome. The wing features dive brakes. The wingspan was later increased to 60 ft (18.3 m), lowering the wing loading somewhat, but increasing the high aspect ratio to 28:1. Originally taking off from a dolly and landing on a fixed skid, the R-6 later had a retractable monowheel landing gear installed.


== Operational history ==
In one four-day period in 1958 Ross flew the R-6 to set four records. He set new World Record marks for the multi-place glider category in 100 km (62 mi), 200 km (124 mi) and 300 km (186 mi) speed triangles and also set a US National Record for out-and-return distance of 234.66 mi (377.65 km). Two of the three World Records exceeded the standing single-place record at the time.In 1959, Ross flew the R-6 solo from Kent, Texas to Farley, New Mexico for his diamond distance and won the Barringer TrophyThe R-6 was later owned by Bob Storck of Waldorf, Maryland who loaned it to the National Soaring Museum, where it is currently listed as in storage.

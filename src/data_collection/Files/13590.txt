Title: List of state highways in Utah
Aspects: {'U road'}

The U.S. state of Utah operates a system of state routes that serve all portions of the state. The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) is responsible for maintaining all of the Interstate, U.S. Routes and state highways in the state. UDOT also maintains the Utah Scenic Byways system, which includes National Scenic Byways that travel through Utah. In official documents the state of Utah uses the term "state routes" for numbered, state maintained highways, since the legal definition of a "highway" includes any public road. UDOT signs state routes with a beehive symbol after the state's nickname of the beehive state. There are 3,658.04 miles (5,887.04 km) of state routes in Utah.
The numbers and routes of all Utah highways are assigned by the state legislature, currently documented in Utah Code Title 72, Chapter 4. The code also defines the Utah maintained portions of Interstate and U.S. Highways. With the exception of state route numbers assigned to match U.S. Highways and Interstate Highways, Utah state route numbers are not designated per any consistent pattern, though there are a few regional clusters of sequentially numbered highways.
There have been four major changes to the Utah state route system: one in 1953, one in 1962 (moving the legislative routes along the Interstates rather than the US Roads), one in 1969, and one in 1977. Since 1969, the block of numbers between 281 and 320 has been reserved for routes serving state institutions and state parks. With a few exceptions, these routes do not have their numbers publicly posted. Prior to the  1977 renumbering, several highways had an officially designated route number that did not match the number signed along the highway. Since 1977, the legislative designations do not have any concurrencies. For the situations where two numbered roads share the same physical roadbed, one of the designations will have a discontinuity in the legislative designation. For example, Interstate 84 is defined as a highway with two separate segments in Utah code, the part where I-84 is signed concurrent with Interstate 15 is only legally designated I-15.
Two Utah state Routes are special cases. State Route 900 and 901 are actually federal and county-maintained dirt roads that were assigned state numbers as to give the state power to block the transportation of nuclear waste to a proposed dump on Goshute tribal lands.The longest contiguous highway signed as a Utah State Route is State Route 24 at 160.243 miles (257.886 km). However, State Route 30 is longer at 223 miles (359 km) when the unsigned concurrencies with I-84, I-15, and US-89 are included. The longest highway of any type in Utah is U.S. Route 89 at 502.577 miles (808.819 km). The shortest state route is State Route 231, a 0.085 miles (0.137 km) connector route in Fairview, though this route is unsigned. The shortest signed route is State Route 103 at 0.225 miles (0.362 km) long, connecting Hill Air Force Base to I-15 and SR-126.

Title: Selfish Cunt
Aspects: {'I Love New York (disambiguation)'}

Selfish Cunt was a rock band based in London, England. The band was formed in early 2003 by Martin Tomlinson and Patrick Constable, and was noted for provocative lyrics, aggressive stage shows, and electronic-influenced rock. Their mix of electric guitar and electronic drum machines was typically accompanied by politically charged and often sexually graphic lyrics. Later becoming a four-piece band through the addition of drums, bass guitar and ceasing to use a drum machine, they developed a sound which incorporated elements of punk and post hardcore.Reaction from critics was mixed. In 2004 The Guardian placed Selfish Cunt at #40 on its list of "top 40 bands in Britain today".

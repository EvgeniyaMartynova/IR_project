Title: Violadores del Verso
Aspects: {'V de V'}

Violadores del Verso (Spanish: Lyrical Molesters or Verse Rapists), also known as Doble V, are a rap music crew from Zaragoza, Spain. They used the name Doble V but were forced to return to their original long name due to legal issues (Doble V is also the trademark of a Spanish whiskey). The band members are MCs Kase.O (born 1 March 1980), Lírico (born 25 December 1976), Sho-Hai (also known as Hate) (born 19 February 1976) and DJ R de Rumba (born 14 July 1976). They are often considered the greatest Spanish hip hop group in history and one of the most influential Spanish-speaking hip hop artists of all time.


== Biography ==
Violadores del Verso started off in 1997 in Zaragoza, Spain. They were initially 5 MC's, but Brutal (Kase.O's brother) left the group. In 1999 they published their first LP as a group, which increased their popularity on the Spanish rap scene.
They had legal problems with a whiskey company called Doble V so they changed the name of the group back to their original name Violadores del Verso. In 2001 they published two more albums as Doble V. In 2006 they published "Vivir para Contarlo", which is regarded as one of the best Spanish hip hop albums of all time.

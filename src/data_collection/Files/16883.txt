Title: Nissan Z engine
Aspects: {'Z16'}

The Nissan Z engine is a series of automobile and light truck engines that was engineered by Nissan Machinery, manufactured by the Nissan Motor Company from 1979 through August 1989. All Z engines had 4 cylinders, a total of 8 valves and a single overhead camshaft (SOHC). Displacements ranged from 1.6 L to 2.4 L.The Z series' engine blocks were nearly identical to those of the earlier L Series with the exception of the Z24. While the Z16 and Z18 engines had a deck height similar to the earlier L13/L14/L16/L18 variants, the Z24 had a taller deck height to accommodate a longer stroke. The most notable difference between the Z-series engine and its predecessor was the introduction of a new crossflow cylinder head which reduced emissions by moving the intake ports to the right side of the engine opposite the exhaust ports. This change allows the exhaust port velocity to more effectively scavenge the cylinder and reduce reversion pulses to enhance induction. The Z series evolved into the NA and KA engines which, along with the smaller CA series, replaced the Z series .


== Z16 ==
The Z16 made its first appearance in 1978 in a new base-model version of the Nissan Navara (D21), which had debuted the previous year with the then-new Z18. Offered only in selected overseas markets, this version of the engine came with a single downdraft carburetor. Later it was also seen in a few low-end model Datsun Bluebird 910s for the Japanese domestic market and some Nissan commercial vehicles in a single-plug configuration.

== Z18 ==
The Z18 debuted in 1977, the first model of the Z-type engine to be released. Displacing 1,770 cc (1.8 L) with a bore and stroke of 85 mm × 78 mm (3.35 in × 3.07 in), it is essentially an older L18 type series four-cylinder with the new cross-flow cylinder head. A 1980 twin-carburetor version produced 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) at 6,000 rpm (SAE).
Export specification is 77 PS (57 kW; 76 hp) those of Datsun · 180K (C210 type Skyline) at 5,600 rpm (DIN/net [Note 2] ), is 86 PS (63 kW; 85 hp) those of 910-series Bluebird, twin carburetor specifications 910 Bluebird SSS and Sylvia for export was 90–92 PS (66–68 kW; 89–91 hp). Z18 was also available in some of the commercial vehicle engine lineups; those models were of a single plug cylinder head design.

== Z18E ==
The Z18E is a 1.8 L (1,770 cc) fuel-injected engine produced primarily for the Japanese market. Most specs were the same as those of the Z18, but maximum power increased to 115 PS (85 kW; 113 hp) (SAE) at 6,200 rpm in 1980 (Bluebird, Skyline).Applications:

Nissan Bluebird 910
Nissan Skyline 1800TI (C210)
Nissan Skyline 1800TI (R30)


== Z18ET ==
The Z18ET is a 1.8 L (1,770 cc) turbocharged and fuel-injected engine first introduced in the 1979 S110 Silvia/Gazelle. It was produced primarily for the Japanese market and produced 135 PS (99 kW; 133 hp).
Applications:

1979-1983 Nissan Silvia S110
1979-1986 Datsun Bluebird 910 - 135 PS (99 kW; 133 hp) at 6000 rpm, 20 kg⋅m (196 N⋅m; 145 lb⋅ft) at 3600 rpm


== Z20S ==
The Z20S (S denotes carbureted) is a 2.0 L (1,952 cc) engine with a bore and stroke of 85 mm × 86 mm (3.35 in × 3.39 in) that produced from 1979 through 1984. It replaced the L20B while using many of the same bottom-end components.
Applications:

1979-1981 Datsun 510 (88 hp or 89 PS or 66 kW SAE)
1981 Datsun 720
Nissan Cabstar (Europe, 90 PS or 66 kW or 89 hp DIN at 5000 rpm)
1980-1986 Nissan/Datsun Caravan/Urvan/Nissan Homy E23 (105 PS or 77 kW or 104 hp at 5200 rpm, European versions have 87 PS or 64 kW or 86 hp)
1986-1997 Nissan Caravan/Urvan/Homy E24
1979.10-1980.11 Nissan Laurel C230
1980.11-1984.10 Nissan Laurel C31 (110 PS or 81 kW or 108 hp at 5600 rpm)In the US, the Z20S was only available in the 1980-81 510/A10 and 1984 720 pickup with the MPG option.
Nissan Caravans or Homys with this engine could reach a maximum speed of 160 km/h (99 mph). They were noted for being faster than their competition from Toyota primarily because the Z20S engine produced more power than the engines available in the equivalent Hiace.


== Z20E ==
The Z20E is a fuel-injected version of the Z20S engine produced from 1979 through July 1984. It had longer connecting rods and shorter compression-height pistons than the 1980-81 Z20S. It produces 100 PS (74 kW; 99 hp). The Z20E was not available in the 720 pickup, which only used carbureted versions. The Z20 engine was not available at all in US-spec. 720 pickups nor California-spec. D21 pickups.
Applications:

1979-1981 Datsun 200SX
1985-1988 Nissan Pickup D21 (citation needed D21 introduced in 1986 as 1987 model)


== Z22S ==
The Z22S (carb only) was 2.2 L (2,188 cc) produced from 1980 through early 1983. Bore and stroke are 87 mm × 92 mm (3.43 in × 3.62 in); respectively. It produces 86 hp (64 kW; 87 PS) SAE as fitted to the US-market Datsun 720.
Applications:

1981-1982 Datsun 720


== Z22E ==
The Z22E is a fuel-injected version of the Z22 engine produced from 1981 through 1983, mainly for North America. This engine has longer connecting rods and shorter compression-height pistons than the carbureted Z22S engine.
Applications:

1981-1983 Datsun 200SX (103 hp or 77 kW or 104 PS SAE at 5200 rpm)


== Z24 ==
The Z24 was 2.4 L (2,389 cc) produced from 1983 through August 1989. A throttle-body fuel injection version (Z24i) was also produced, beginning in April 1985.
Applications:

1983.5-1986 Nissan/Datsun 720
1986 Nissan/Datsun 720 (Z24i) (ST models only)
1986-1989 Nissan Hardbody Truck (Z24i)
1986-1989 Nissan Pathfinder (E model only)
1987-1990 Nissan Vanette/Nomadvarious Forklift applications Z24 versions in gas and LPG
Note:  All USDM gasoline Z20, Z22 and Z24 engines were known as NAPS-Z (NAPZ or NAPS-Z Nissan Anti-Pollution System), NAPZ motors had dual spark-plugs (two per cylinder) except the pre-82 versions and latest versions of the Z24i as fitted to the Pathfinder. All NAPZ engines sold in California reportedly had dual plug heads regardless of the year.
The fuel-injected version referenced above was denoted as the Z24i (Throttle Body Fuel Injection) and was first available in the Nissan Model 720 ST pickup during the 1985 model year and was replaced in 1990 by the KA24E engine and they share the same bellhousing pattern. Beside the fuel-injection, a significant change for the Z24i was the addition of an optical crank angle sensor in the distributor rather than a vacuum advance and ignition module. This allowed the JECS throttle-body injection system to identify the top dead center (TDC) of cylinder number one.

Title: Yali language
Aspects: {'Yali'}

Yali (Yaly, Jalè, Jaly) is a Papuan language of Indonesian New Guinea. The Yali people live east of the Baliem Valley, in the Western Highlands.
Dialectical differentiation is great enough that Ethnologue assigns separate codes to three varieties:

Pass Valley, also known as Abendago, North Ngalik, and Western Yali; subdialects are Pass Valley, Landikma, Apahapsili.
Ninia, also known as North Ngalik and Southern Yali (Yali Selatan).
Angguruk, also known as Northern Yali.However, almost nothing is known of this language. Not even the pronouns were attested for Ross (2005) to base a classification on. With this said, new data is currently being elicited from correspondence between Quinn Cunningham and Felix Neckweck.

== Description ==
Palafoxia arida var. gigantea is an erect, slender stem grows 30â€“60 cm tall, branching in the lower half and is sparsely leaved. It is glandular and hairy on the upper parts.It has 2-5 inch slender leaves.In the Yuma region of the Lower Colorado River Valley, in semi-shaded sites with annual but sparse rainfall, single plants can grow to be bushy and produce around 100 flowers.
The wind-borne seeds are dandelion-like, but larger and in a smaller quantity per flower. The plant with seed is easily identified since the seeds splay out in a flat circle until broken from the plant by strong wind. The seed is macroscopic in size, with about 10-16 seeds per circular flower-splay, each seed up to 0.6 in before the parachute.

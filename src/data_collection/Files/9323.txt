Title: List of bus routes in Nassau County, New York
Aspects: {'N79'}

The following bus routes are operated in Nassau County, New York. Most of these routes are operated under Nassau Inter-County Express (NICE), formerly MTA Long Island Bus, except in Greater Long Beach, where that city operates its own bus service through Long Beach Bus. Some of them are the direct descendants of streetcar lines (see List of streetcar lines on Long Island and in Queens), and most were previously privately operated prior to 1973. These routes are designated on the buses, bus stop signs, and timetables with a lowercase "n". Previously, the routes were designated with an uppercase "N", akin to routes in bus systems surrounding the area. Note that the buses purchased secondhand from Foothill Transit still display the uppercase "N" on their signs.

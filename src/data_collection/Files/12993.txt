He must defeat them by whatever means necessary in order to protect the city, capturing gang leaders and rescuing injured civilians along the way.


== Development ==
Urban Chaos: Riot Response was known by three different names in development, it was first called Roll Call, a first-person shooter set in a run-down city in the near future. The project became Zero Tolerance, a first-person shooter following a member of an elite anti-gang unit who must defend a city under siege. The game was developed using the Havok physics engine for in-game physics effects. ReplicaNet was used to supply the software in the online and LAN multiplayer action. Perforce Software's Source Control Management (SCM) System was used to manage the game's source code, documents, and digital asset development.

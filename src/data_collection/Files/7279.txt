Title: Smith & Wesson Model 14
Aspects: {'K38'}

The Smith & Wesson Model K-38 Target Masterpiece Revolver Model 14 is a six-shot, double-action revolver with adjustable open sights built on the medium-size "K" frame. It is chambered for the .38 Special cartridge, and most were fitted with a 6 in (150 mm) or 8 3⁄8 in (210 mm) barrel. A small batch were made with 4 in (100 mm) barrels, and even fewer were made with 5 in (130 mm) barrels. First produced in 1947 and originally known as the K-38 Target Masterpiece, it was renamed the Model 14 in 1957 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. It is built on the same medium-sized frame (K-frame) as the seminal Smith & Wesson Model 10 ("Military and Police") revolver. The K-38 model was authorized for duty with the Los Angeles Police Department in the 1960s and early 1970s.


== Variants ==
The Model 14 Masterpiece Single-Action was available in 1961 and 1962. It came with a 6 in (150 mm) barrel and functioned in single-action only. It was otherwise identical to the rest of the Model 14s.
Smith & Wesson also released a Model 14 in their "Classics" line. A nickel-plated version has since been discontinued, but the blued-steel version is still available. Other than the finishes, the revolvers were identical with 6 in (150 mm) barrels, a pinned Patridge front sight, a micro-adjustable rear sight, and wood grips.

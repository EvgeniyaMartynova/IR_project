Title: Fokker F.XXXVI
Aspects: {'F36'}

The Fokker F.XXXVI was a 1930s Dutch four-engined 32-passenger airliner designed and built by Fokker. It was the largest transport designed and built by Fokker.


== Development ==
The Fokker F.XXXVI registered PH-AJA first flew on 22 June 1934 and was a high-wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear. In Fokker tradition, the wing was an all wood structure and the fuselage was fabric covered steel tube. It was powered by four Wright Cyclone radial piston engines mounted in the wing leading edge, and carried 4 crew and 32 passengers in four eight-seat cabins. In an unusual decision, Fokker engineers went to great length in soundproofing the passenger cabin, enabling passenger to converse in a normal voice after take off. It was delivered to KLM and operated on European routes from March 1935. Although it had a good payload its range was much less than and was structurally inferior to (the maintenance advantages of all-metal aircraft were becoming clear) the new Douglas DC-2 and DC-3 and only one was built. KLM sold the aircraft in 1939 to Scottish Aviation for use as a crew and navigation trainer
for the Royal Air Forces No.12 Elementary Flying Training School, which was operated by Scottish Aviation. It was scrapped in 1940 after it burnt out in a take-off accident.
Airspeed Ltd. in Great Britain arranged a license to build F.XXXVIs for the British market as the Airspeed AS.20, but no orders were received.

== History ==
Directions in Groove formed in 1991 in Sydney by Alexander Hewetson on bass guitar, Terepai Richmond on drums and percussion, Rick Robertson on saxophone, Tim Rollinson on guitar and Scott Saunders (ex-Deckchairs Overboard, Beatfish, also in Bellydance) on keyboards. Hewetson, Richmond and Robertson were, "all graduates of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Jazz." Styled as dig they initially performed instrumental acid jazz before Saunders added vocals. They became popular with a residency at Kinselas in Oxford St, Sydney.
The band toured nationally and released a five-track, self-titled extended play, in April 1993 and attracted Polygram records to sign the band. The Canberra Times' Linc Dubwise observed, "[the] acid jazz group, however, delights in the potential of jazz as accessible, entertaining, populist and, above all, danceable. The acid label is no more than a convenient identifier for the current generation of artists melding elements of jazz, fusion, funk, rap, soul and world music." They continued touring in the following year, Hewetson left to join rock, funk, disco group, Swoop; he was replaced on bass guitar by Sam Dixon.dig issued their first full-length album, Deeper, in March 1994. It peaked at No. 6 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and was certified gold by Australian Recording Industry Association for shipment of 35000 units. Nicole Leedham of The Canberra Times observed, "It attracts both older jazz audiences and younger rock followers and keeps them both happy." The group changed their name to Directions in Groove, to avoid confusion with a Canadian group, dig, which was touring internationally. Deeper had its international release via Verve, and they undertook tours in Australia and Europe. In July 1994 they performed at Battersea Park, London for Britain's first B & S Ball. They also toured supporting other artists, Herbie Hancock and Bootsy Collins.
Directions in Groove's second album, Speakeasy, appeared in August 1995, which was co-produced by the group with Jeremy Allom (Incognito, Björk, Massive Attack). It reached No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, compared their first two albums, "[this] was a more mature, confident and ultimately more durable album... It was a fine collection of sweet, funky jazz-grooves backed up impeccable musicianship." Christo of Tharunka magazine felt Dixon provides, "a big thick meaty bass line that pumps solidly through each track. This new bass sound coupled with the beautifully inventive drumming of Terapai Richmond allows the other musicians to fly high, confident in the rock solid rhythm section. The listener is at ease
and floats with the band to places silky smooth and be-bop groovy." A limited release version of Speakeasy included a bonus disc of six live tracks recorded at the Basement, Sydney.At the APRA Music Awards of 1996 they won Most Performed Jazz Work for their three-track EP, Futures (August 1995). The band's most popular tracks are "The Favourite", "Reinvent Yourself", and "Hip Replacement". A third album, Curvystrasse, appeared in 1998, and was co-produced by the group with Lex Wilson.
The original members of the group reformed in the wake of playing to a packed crowd in June 2008. During 2011 Laura Stitt joined on lead vocals, they subsequently recorded their fourth studio album, "Clearlight", which was released on 14 October 2011.

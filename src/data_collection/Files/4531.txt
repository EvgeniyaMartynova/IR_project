== Background ==
After being removed from the hip hop group, Death Threat (hip hop group) on the year 1999, Gloc-9 found himself working in a commissary in Quezon City as a helper. Despite absence in music industry for at least a year, he did not stop recording demos (and submit these to recording companies) using his earnings from his work to record some. Until one day, his demo tape accidentally went to the hands of Enrico Santos when it was found in the bins of scrap demos. After listening to Gloc-9's demo tape, he ordered to look for him. Searching for Gloc-9 took three months since the only details they had was his real name and his town which is Binangonan, Rizal. Instead of being a performer, on year 2000, Gloc-9 was hired as a music researcher of ABS-CBN where his job is to present songs to be used for movies and television shows to be released by the network and its film and television production company and film distributor. But most of the time, the songs he presented were rejected so he decided to create and record more songs especially made for the show. After at least four of his songs were used as soundtrack of several movies, and after being one of the finalists of the songwriting competition, Himig Handog Love Songs on the year 2002, the label, Star Music asked Gloc-9 to write more songs and add to his already created ones to create a full-length album which became his solo full-length self-titled album.

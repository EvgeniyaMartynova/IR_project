Between 2000 and 2006, the first six seasons of Gilmore Girls originally aired on The WB, before it later merged with UPN to form The CW in 2006. All seven seasons are currently available on DVD in Regions 1, 2, and 4. Since the series premiered, it has averaged 5 million viewers per episode over its seven seasons. The series originally aired on Thursday nights 8/7c before Charmed in its first season.

The show placed No. 32 on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list, and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine's "All-TIME 100 TV Shows." The show is known for its fast dialogue with endless run-on sentences. 
Over the course of seven seasons, Gilmore Girls aired a total of 153 episodes. It returned in November 2016 for a limited miniseries titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. The revival consists of four 90-minute episodes and was released on Netflix.

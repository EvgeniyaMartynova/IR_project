Title: I Love the '80s 3-D
Aspects: {"I Love the '80s"}

I Love the '80s 3-D is the follow-up to VH1's 1980s nostalgia show I Love the '80s and its sequel I Love the '80s Strikes Back. It premiered October 24, 2005. Like its predecessors, it premiered in one-hour installments, each describing the events and trends of a year between 1980 and 1989, two shows per night until Friday, October 28, 2005.
The show is actually in 3D, using a process called ChromaDepth that appears in 3D when using a special pair of ChromaDepth glasses, but the process allows the show to be viewable in normal 2D (unlike the anaglyphic 3D process). The ChromaDepth glasses for the show were available free at Best Buy stores across the United States.

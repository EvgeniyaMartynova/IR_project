=== History ===
The name "greenback" refers to the use of paper money for financial transactions at a time when gold and silver coin was the preferred rate of exchange.  The property that Greenback Lane lies on was bought with greenback dollars (United States Note).  The owner is said to have wished to be paid with coin, and became angered when he was not, hence the name "Greenback Lane."Construction to expand Greenback Lane between Dewey Drive/Van Maren Lane and Auburn Boulevard in Citrus Heights from four to six lanes was completed in 2008, creating an entirely six lane thoroughfare within the city of Citrus Heights.

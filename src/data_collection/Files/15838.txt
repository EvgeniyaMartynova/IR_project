Title: Chi-squared distribution
Aspects: {'XAND'}

In probability theory and statistics, the chi-square distribution (also chi-squared or χ2-distribution) with k degrees of freedom is the distribution of a sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random variables. The chi-square distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution and is one of the most widely used probability distributions in inferential statistics, notably in hypothesis testing and in construction of confidence intervals. When it is being distinguished from the more general noncentral chi-square distribution, this distribution is sometimes called the central chi-square distribution.
The chi-square distribution is used in the common chi-square tests for goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical one, the independence of two criteria of classification of qualitative data, and in confidence interval estimation for a population standard deviation of a normal distribution from a sample standard deviation.  Many other statistical tests also use this distribution, such as Friedman's analysis of variance by ranks.

    {\displaystyle Q\ \sim \ \chi ^{2}(k)\ \ {\text{or}}\ \ Q\ \sim \ \chi _{k}^{2}.}
  The chi-square distribution has one parameter: a positive integer k that specifies the number of degrees of freedom (the number of Zi s).


== Introduction ==
The chi-square distribution is used primarily in hypothesis testing, and to a lesser extent for confidence intervals for population variance when the underlying distribution is normal. Unlike more widely known distributions such as the normal distribution and the exponential distribution, the chi-square distribution is not as often applied in the direct modeling of natural phenomena. It arises in the following hypothesis tests, among others:

Chi-square test of independence in contingency tables
Chi-square test of goodness of fit of observed data to hypothetical distributions
Likelihood-ratio test for nested models
Log-rank test in survival analysis
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test for stratified contingency tablesIt is also a component of the definition of the t-distribution and the F-distribution used in t-tests, analysis of variance, and regression analysis.
The primary reason that the chi-square distribution is used extensively in hypothesis testing is its relationship to the normal distribution. Many hypothesis tests use a test statistic, such as the t-statistic in a t-test. For these hypothesis tests, as the sample size, n, increases, the sampling distribution of the test statistic approaches the normal distribution (central limit theorem). Because the test statistic (such as t) is asymptotically normally distributed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large, the distribution used for hypothesis testing may be approximated by a normal distribution. Testing hypotheses using a normal distribution is well understood and relatively easy. The simplest chi-square distribution is the square of a standard normal distribution. So wherever a normal distribution could be used for a hypothesis test, a chi-square distribution could be used.
Suppose that Z is a random variable sampled from the standard normal distribution, where the mean equals to 0 and the variance equals to 1: Z ~ N(0,1). Now, consider the random variable Q = Z2. The distribution of the random variable Q is an example of a chi-square distribution: 
  
    
      
         
        Q
         
        ∼
         
        
          χ
          
            1
          
          
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ Q\ \sim \ \chi _{1}^{2}.}
   The subscript 1 indicates that this particular chi-square distribution is constructed from only 1 standard normal distribution. A chi-square distribution constructed by squaring a single standard normal distribution is said to have 1 degree of freedom. Thus, as the sample size for a hypothesis test increases, the distribution of the test statistic approaches a normal distribution, and the distribution of the square of the test statistic approaches a chi-square distribution. Just as extreme values of the normal distribution have low probability (and give small p-values), extreme values of the chi-square distribution have low probability.
An additional reason that the chi-square distribution is widely used is that it is a member of the class of likelihood ratio tests (LRT). LRT's have several desirable properties; in particular, LRT's commonly provide the highest power to reject the null hypothesis (Neyman–Pearson lemma). However, the normal and chi-square approximations are only valid asymptotically. For this reason, it is preferable to use the t distribution rather than the normal approximation or the chi-square approximation for a small sample size. Similarly, in analyses of contingency tables, the chi-square approximation will be poor for a small sample size, and it is preferable to use Fisher's exact test. Ramsey shows that the exact binomial test is always more powerful than the normal approximation.Lancaster shows the connections among the binomial, normal, and chi-square distributions, as follows. De Moivre and Laplace established that a binomial distribution could be approximated by a normal distribution. Specifically they showed the asymptotic normality of the random variable

Because the square of a standard normal distribution is the chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom, the probability of a result such as 1 heads in 10 trials can be approximated either by the normal or the chi-square distribution. However, many problems involve more than the two possible outcomes of a binomial, and instead require 3 or more categories, which leads to the multinomial distribution. Just as de Moivre and Laplace sought for and found the normal approximation to the binomial, Pearson sought for and found a multivariate normal approximation to the multinomial distribution. Pearson showed that the chi-square distribution, the sum of multiple normal distributions, was such an approximation to the multinomial distribution

    {\displaystyle \gamma (s,t)}
   is the lower incomplete gamma function and 
  
    
      
        P

In a special case of k = 2 this function has a simple form:

  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ;

    {\displaystyle F(x;\,2)=1-e^{-x/2}}
  and the integer recurrence of the gamma function makes it easy to compute for other small even k.

=== Additivity ===
It follows from the definition of the chi-square distribution that the sum of independent chi-square variables is also chi-square distributed. Specifically, if {Xi}i=1n are independent chi-square variables with {ki}i=1n degrees of freedom, respectively, then Y = X1 + ⋯ + Xn is chi-square distributed with k1 + ⋯ + kn degrees of freedom.

  Asymptotically, given that for a scale parameter

=== Cumulants ===
The cumulants are readily obtained by a (formal) power series expansion of the logarithm of the characteristic function:

  
    
      
        
          κ
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          2
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        n
        −
        1
        )
        !
        
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa _{n}=2^{n-1}(n-1)!\,k}
  


=== Asymptotic properties ===
By the central limit theorem, because the chi-square distribution is the sum of k independent random variables with finite mean and variance, it converges to a normal distribution for large k. For many practical purposes, for k > 50 the distribution is sufficiently close to a normal distribution for the difference to be ignored. Specifically, if X ~ χ2(k), then as k tends to infinity, the distribution of 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        −
        k
        )
        
          /
        
        
          
            2
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X-k)/{\sqrt {2k}}}
   tends to a standard normal distribution. However, convergence is slow as the skewness is 
  
    
      
        
          
            8
            
              /
            
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {8/k}}}
   and the excess kurtosis is 12/k.
The sampling distribution of ln(χ2) converges to normality much faster than the sampling distribution of χ2, as the logarithm removes much of the asymmetry. Other functions of the chi-square distribution converge more rapidly to a normal distribution. Some examples are:

chi-square distribution is a transformation of Pareto distribution
Student's t-distribution is a transformation of chi-square distribution
Student's t-distribution can be obtained from chi-square distribution and normal distribution
Noncentral beta distribution can be obtained as a transformation of chi-square distribution and Noncentral chi-square distribution
Noncentral t-distribution can be obtained from normal distribution and chi-square distributionA chi-square variable with k degrees of freedom is defined as the sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random variables.
If Y is a k-dimensional Gaussian random vector with mean vector μ and rank k covariance matrix C, then X = (Y−μ)TC−1(Y − μ) is chi-square distributed with k degrees of freedom.
The sum of squares of statistically independent unit-variance Gaussian variables which do not have mean zero yields a generalization of the chi-square distribution called the noncentral chi-square distribution.
If Y is a vector of k i.i.d. standard normal random variables and A is a k×k symmetric, idempotent matrix with rank k−n then the quadratic form YTAY is chi-square distributed with k−n degrees of freedom.

   where X1 ~ χ²(k1) and X2  ~ χ²(k2) are statistically independent.
If X1  ~  χ2k1 and X2  ~  χ2k2 are statistically independent, then X1 + X2  ~ χ2k1+k2. If X1 and X2 are not independent, then X1 + X2 is not chi-square distributed.


== Generalizations ==
The chi-square distribution is obtained as the sum of the squares of k independent, zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian random variables. Generalizations of this distribution can be obtained by summing the squares of other types of Gaussian random variables. Several such distributions are described below.

   is not known. It may be, however, approximated efficiently using the property of characteristic functions of chi-square random variables.


=== Chi-square distributions ===


==== Noncentral chi-square distribution ====

The noncentral chi-square distribution is obtained from the sum of the squares of independent Gaussian random variables having unit variance and nonzero means.


==== Generalized chi-square distribution ====

The generalized chi-square distribution is obtained from the quadratic form z′Az where z is a zero-mean Gaussian vector having an arbitrary covariance matrix, and A is an arbitrary matrix.

    {\displaystyle X\sim \chi _{k}^{2}}
   is a special case of the gamma distribution, in that 
  
    
      
        X
        ∼
        Γ
        
          (

          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\sim \Gamma \left({\frac {k}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}}\right)}
   using the rate parameterization of the gamma distribution (or

  
    
      
        X

        Γ

   using the scale parameterization of the gamma distribution)
where k is an integer.
Because the exponential distribution is also a special case of the gamma distribution, we also have that if

    {\displaystyle X\sim \operatorname {Exp} \left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)}

The Erlang distribution is also a special case of the gamma distribution and thus we also have that if 
  
    
      
        X
        ∼
        
          χ

    {\displaystyle X\sim \chi _{k}^{2}}
   with even k, then X is Erlang distributed with shape parameter k/2 and scale parameter 1/2.


== Occurrence and applications ==
The chi-square distribution has numerous applications in inferential statistics, for instance in chi-square tests and in estimating variances. It enters the problem of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population and the problem of estimating the slope of a regression line via its role in Student's t-distribution. It enters all analysis of variance problems via its role in the F-distribution, which is the distribution of the ratio of two independent chi-squared random variables, each divided by their respective degrees of freedom.
Following are some of the most common situations in which the chi-square distribution arises from a Gaussian-distributed sample.

    {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}(X_{i}-{\bar {X}})^{2}\sim \sigma ^{2}\chi _{n-1}^{2}}

The box below shows some statistics based on Xi ∼ Normal(μi, σ2i), i = 1, ⋯, k,  independent random variables that have probability distributions related to the chi-square distribution:

The chi-square distribution is also often encountered in magnetic resonance imaging.


== Table of χ2 values vs p-values ==
The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme in a chi-square distribution.  Accordingly, since the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the appropriate degrees of freedom (df) gives the probability of having obtained a value less extreme than this point, subtracting the CDF value from 1 gives the p-value.  A low p-value, below the chosen significance level, indicates  statistical significance, i.e., sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. A significance level of 0.05 is often used as the cutoff between significant and non-significant results.
The table below gives a number of p-values matching to 
  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi ^{2}}
   for the first 10 degrees of freedom.

These values can be calculated evaluating the quantile function (also known as “inverse CDF” or “ICDF”) of the chi-square distribution; e. g., the χ2 ICDF for p = 0.05 and df = 7 yields 14.06714 ≈ 14.07 as in the table above.


== History and name ==
This distribution was first described by the German statistician Friedrich Robert Helmert in papers of 1875–6, where he computed the sampling distribution of the sample variance of a normal population. Thus in German this was traditionally known as the Helmert'sche ("Helmertian") or "Helmert distribution".
The distribution was independently rediscovered by the English mathematician Karl Pearson in the context of goodness of fit, for which he developed his Pearson's chi-square test, published in 1900, with computed table of values published in (Elderton 1902), collected in (Pearson 1914, pp. xxxi–xxxiii, 26–28, Table XII).
The name "chi-square" ultimately derives from Pearson's shorthand for the exponent in a multivariate normal distribution with the Greek letter Chi, writing
−½χ2 for what would appear in modern notation as −½xTΣ−1x (Σ being the covariance matrix). The idea of a family of "chi-square distributions", however, is not due to Pearson but arose as a further development due to Fisher in the 1920s.

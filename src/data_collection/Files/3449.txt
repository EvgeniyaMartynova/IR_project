Aspects: {'F series'}

The Mack F series was the third generation of cabover trucks from Mack Trucks. Its production began in 1962 and ended in 1981. It was produced primarily as a set-forward axle truck but a setback axle version was shipped overseas (from the USA). The cab came in a 50 inch (1371.6 mm) day cab (no sleeper). Sleeper models included a 72 inch (1828.8 mm), 80 inch (2032 mm) and later a "bustle back" was added that lengthened the sleeper to 86 inches (2184.4 mm).

== Chassis ==
The Mack F series truck uses taper-leaf front springs, which helps to provide a smoother ride. Taper-lead springs practically eliminate the inter-leaf friction, which is common with multi-leaf spring systems. The taper concept uses springs of equal length and different contour, to assure the springs do not slide against one another while in normal operation. This arrangement, accompanied by forged aluminum rear brackets and shackles equate to a comfortable ride. 

Front axles rated to 18,000 lb (8,200 kg). Constructed from drop-forged I-beam construction.
Power steering is available.

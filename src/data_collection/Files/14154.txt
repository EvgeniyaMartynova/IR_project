(Tampico's Professional Education), a civil organization that sponsored a Faculty of Law and a Faculty of Medicine that were later incorporated into a public school under the auspices of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. On 5 November 1972 it was recognized as an autonomous university.Since Ciudad Victoria is the Tamaulipas capital city, the rectory building and the main administrative offices are headquartered in there.  The main faculties of business, law, natural sciences, education and agriculture are based there as well. Ciudad Victoria is also the home of the university's football soccer team, the Correcaminos UAT.

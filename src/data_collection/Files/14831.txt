Aspects: {'W.A.K.O. World Championships 1993'}

W.A.K.O. World Championships 1993 in Atlantic City were the joint ninth world kickboxing championships hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization arranged by W.A.K.O. USA president Jim Lantrip.  As with the 1985 championships the organization had suffered a temporary split due to political differences, and a second event was planned later in the month in Budapest, although the differences would be resolved in the near future.
The Atlantic City championships were open to amateur men and women, with thirty-one countries taking part, and styles on offer included Semi-Contact, Light-Contact and Musical Forms.  Christine Bannon-Rodrigues, who had made history at the 1991 championships, repeated the feat by winning a further three gold medals and proving the first time was no fluke.  By the end of the event, hosts USA were the strongest nation, with Hungary second and Germany third.  It was held at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, NJ, USA over three days - starting on Thursday, 4 November and ending on Saturday, 6 November 1993.

The women's competition also expanded, now having five divisions, ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 65 kg/143 lbs.  As with the last world championships in London, Christine Bannon-Rodrigues was the most notable winner as she repeated her three gold medal feat - winning in Semi-Contact as well in Musical Forms (x2), while Lajos Hugyetz would win two golds (winning in Light-Contact as well), and karate fighter Tony Young was a further notable winner.  By the end of the championships the strongest country in Semi-Contact was the host nation USA with four golds, two silvers and six bronzes.

== Light-Contact ==
More physical than Semi-Contact but less so than Full-Contact, points were awarded and fights won on the basis of speed and technique over power, and it was seen as a transition stage for fighters who were considering a move from Semi to Full-Contact.   More information on Light-Contact rules can be found of the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules may have changed since 1993.  As with Semi-Contact, the men and women had new weight divisions, with the men having eight ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 89 kg/+195.8 lbs, and the women five, ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 65 kg/143 lbs.  Notable winners included Lajos Hugyetz (who also won gold in Semi-Contact) and future pro boxing champion Pelé Reid, who added to the gold he had won at the last W.A.K.O. Europeans.  By the end of the championships Hungary was by far the most successful nation in Light-Contact, winning six golds, one silver and one bronze medal.

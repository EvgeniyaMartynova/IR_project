Aspects: {'M. japonica'}

Monocentris japonica,Japanese pineapplefish,is a pinecone fish of the family Monocentridae, found in the tropical  Indo-West Pacific Oceans, at depths between 2 and 100 m and can be found on both rocky and coral reefs. The fish is nocturnal and shelters in caves and under ledges during the day.


== Morphology ==
The pineconefish is yellow with distinct large scales outlined in black.  It has light-producing organs filled with luminescent bacteria on each side of the lower jaw, the purpose of which is not known, but may help it to see at night or to attract prey.  The fish grows to 17 cm, but is more commonly found up to 12 cm.


== In captivity ==
Pinecone fish are often kept by aquarists because they are not aggressive and easy to keep. In aquaria, they are usually fed fresh marine foods or brine shrimp.

== Specifications ==


=== Engine ===

The F12berlinetta uses a 6,262 cc (6.3 L; 382.1 cu in), naturally aspirated 65° V12 engine of the Ferrari F140 engine family. Displacement is shared with the FF, but the F140 FC version installed on the F12 generates a  power output of 740 PS (544 kW; 730 hp) at 8,250 rpm and 690 N⋅m (509 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,000 rpm, making it the fourth most powerful Ferrari road car produced to date, only surpassed by the LaFerrari, F12tdf and its successor, the 812 Superfast.The engine of the F12berlinetta has been designed to be more efficient than that of the 599, as well as more powerful. The engine management system is fitted with Ferrari's HELE start-stop system to reduce fuel consumption when idling. Ferrari reports that the F12berlinetta can achieve 18 mpg‑imp (15.7 L/100 km; 15.0 mpg‑US) – a 30% improvement over the 599 – and produces CO2 emissions of 350 g/km.


=== Transmission ===
Similar to the California, 458 Italia, FF and LaFerrari, the F12berlinetta transmits power through a 7-speed dual-clutch semi-automatic gearbox operated by the driver using paddle shifters present behind the steering wheel. Compared to similar models, the F12berlinetta uses shortened gear ratios to match the power of the engine.


=== Chassis ===

The F12berlinetta is built around an aluminium space frame chassis co-developed with Scaglietti. The chassis is made up of 12 different aluminium alloys and improves structural rigidity by 20% over the 599, whilst reducing weight by 70 kg (154 lb). The centre of gravity has also been lowered by around 25 mm (1 in). The F12berlinetta's weight distribution is 48% front, 52% rear.

Similar to other contemporary Ferrari models, the F12berlinetta uses Ferrari's third generation CCM3 carbon ceramic disc brakes with ABS, SCM-E magnetorheological suspension, an electronic LSD, ESP Premium stability control and F1-Trac traction control. The car's stability and traction control, suspension and other settings are controlled by the Manettino dial mounted on the steering wheel.


=== Tyres ===
The F12berlinetta is fitted with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres, with the tyre codes 255/35 ZR20 (on 20"×9.5J wheels) at the front and 315/35 ZR20 (on 20"×11.5J wheels) at the rear.


=== Aerodynamics ===

The F12berlinetta makes use of aerodynamic techniques based on Ferrari's 599XX and Formula One programmes, developed with wind tunnel and CFD testing. A notable feature is the Aero Bridge, an air channel running from the bonnet, through the flanks and along the sides of the vehicle, creating an effect that increases downforce. Another feature is Active Brake Cooling ducts, which open to direct cooling air only when the brakes are hot, keeping them closed at other times to reduce aerodynamic drag. The F12berlinetta produces 123 kg (271 lb) of downforce at 200 km/h (124 mph) – an increase of 76% over the 599 GTB – and has a drag coefficient of 0.299.


=== Performance ===
Ferrari reports that the F12berlinetta is capable of lapping the Fiorano test circuit in 1 minute, 23 seconds; three seconds slower than the LaFerrari, a full second faster than the 599 GTO, two seconds faster than the Enzo Ferrari, two seconds faster than the 458 Italia, three seconds faster than the 430 Scuderia and three and a half seconds faster than the 599 GTB.Ferrari claimed the F12berlinetta to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.1 seconds, 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 8.5 seconds and to reach a top speed of 340 km/h (211 mph).


== Design ==
The body of the F12berlinetta is designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre and Pininfarina, and shares some styling elements with other recent Ferrari models. This includes a front grille similar to the FF and headlights shared with the FF and 458 Italia. The interior, based on the FF, features new "Frau leather" upholstery with aluminium, Alutex, and carbon fibre trim, and has increased luggage space compared to the 599.The body computer system is developed by Magneti Marelli Automotive Lighting.


== Ferrari F12tdf (2015–2017) ==

The F12tdf (tour de France) is a track-focused version of the F12berlinetta unveiled in October 2015. The name pays homage to the Tour de France automobile race held between 1899 and 1986 and which was regularly won by the Ferrari 250 between 1956 and 1964. The F12tdf shares the same 6.3 litre V12 engine with the F12berlinetta, but with power output increased to 780 PS (574 kW; 769 hp) at 8500 rpm and 705 N⋅m (520 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6750 rpm. The F12tdf is 110 kg (243 lb) lighter than the F12, having a claimed dry weight of 1,415 kg (3,120 lb). Ferrari claimed the F12tdf to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.9 seconds and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 7.9 seconds. The top speed was claimed to be 'in excess of 340 km/h (211 mph)'. The car has recorded a 1 minute 21 seconds lap time on Ferrari's Fiorano test circuit , 2 seconds faster than the standard F12berlinetta and 488 GTB, and just 1.3 seconds behind the fastest lap set by the LaFerrari. F12tdf was designed by Ferrari Styling Centre. Production of the F12tdf was limited to 799 units.

The body also has 3 vents behind each side window, 3 on each side of the rear bumper and 4 vents on each fender inspired by the vents on the racing 275 GTB/C. The "RW" designation stands for the initials of the person who commissioned the car, Florida dentist Rick Workman, who also owns the 599-based Ferrari P540 Superfast Aperta unveiled in 2009 and the F12-based F60 America mentioned above that was unveiled in 2014.


=== Ferrari SP3JC ===
Presented in November 2018, the SP3JC is a one-off roadster based on the F12tdf. There were two matching cars ordered, one in LHD, the other in RHD with different liveries. They were designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre to pay homage to Ferrari roadsters of 1950s and 1960s. They are powered by the V12 engine from the F12tdf which is unchanged from the production car. The body has been completely redesigned, and includes redesigned front and rear fascias, a new front bumper, a rear diffuser, transparent hood vents that show off the engine, roll hoops behind the seats, taillights and wheels from the 812 Superfast and a blue, white and blue paint job that pays homage to the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO. "JC" stands for John Collins, a Scottish collector and founder of Talacrest, a classic Ferrari dealer located in the U.K. He commissioned the car in mid 2014 and it took 3.5 years to complete. Ferrari said the design process alone took 2 of those years.

Title: Honda E engine
Aspects: {'E series'}

The E-series was a line of inline 4-cylinder automobile engines from Honda. These engines were used in the popular Honda Civic, Accord, and Prelude cars in the 1970s and 1980s. One notable technology was CVCC, introduced with this family, which allowed the company to meet strict emissions standards without using a catalytic converter.
The CVCC ED1 was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines of the 20th century list.


== EA ==
Also see the Japanese Wikipedia entryThe EA-series is a water-cooled 356 cc (21.7 cu in) inline two-cylinder engine replacing the N360's air-cooled 354 cc (21.6 cu in) engine. An SOHC design with a timing belt (replacing the chain used in the N360 engine), the EA was first seen in the 1971 Honda Life. This engine was derived from the air-cooled engine in the Honda CB450 and was adapted for water-cooled application. The displacement was reduced to be in compliance with Japanese kei car legislation that stipulated maximum engine displacement. Bore and stroke were 67 mm × 50.6 mm (2.64 in × 1.99 in). A version producing 30 PS (22 kW) at 8,000 rpm was installed in the Honda Life, while the Honda Z and the Honda Life Touring (introduced in May 1972) received a twin-carb model with 36 PS (26 kW) at a heady 9,000 rpm.

== EH ==
The water-cooled SOHC two-cylinder EH was first seen installed in the first generation Honda Acty truck introduced in July 1977, and later in the 1985 Honda Today. It was based on one bank of cylinders from the horizontally opposed four used on the Honda Gold Wing GL1000 motorcycle, with which it shared the 72 mm (2.83 in) bore. The horsepower rating of the 545 cc (33.3 cu in) 72 mm × 67 mm (2.83 in × 2.64 in) engine was 28 PS (21 kW) at 5,500 rpm, and 4.2 kg⋅m (41 N⋅m; 30 lb⋅ft) at 4,000 rpm. When installed in the Today, max power was raised to 31 PS (23 kW) at the same revs, and torque at 4.4 kg⋅m (43 N⋅m; 32 lb⋅ft), with a compression ratio of 9.5:1.Applications:

== ER ==
The long-stroke ER four-cylinder engine,

sold as a 12-valve CVCC-II in Japan and as a simple eight-valve unit in Europe and Asia,
was only used in the AA/VF/FA series City/Jazz from 1981 until 1986.
It was available as a normally aspirated carburated version or with Honda's own PGM-FI fuel injection as one of a very few turbocharged engines built by Honda.
The Japanese market CVCC engine was also known as COMBAX, an acronym of COMpact Blazing-combustion AXiom. The E-series were tuned for economy, with higher gearing and later on with computer-controlled variable lean burn.
As of March 1985, the naturally aspirated ER engines gained composite conrods (a world first in a production car), lighter and stronger these helped further reduce fuel consumption.The lower powered engines in the commercial "Pro" series had a lower compression, a mechanically timed ignition rather than the breakerless setup found in the passenger cars, and a manual choke. The ER had five crankshaft bearings and the overhead camshaft was driven by a cogged belt.

Carburetor versions used either a single or 2bbl downdraft Keihin. The turbocharger in the Turbo and Turbo II was developed together with IHI, the Turbo II being equipped with an intercooler and a computer-controlled wastegate.ER1-4 Honda City


== ES ==
The ES displaced 1.8 L; 111.6 cu in (1,829 cc). All ES engines were SOHC 12-valve engines. The ES1 used dual sidedraft carburetors to produce 102 PS (75 kW; 101 hp) @ 5500 rpm and 14.4 kg⋅m (141 N⋅m; 104 lb⋅ft) @ 4000 rpm. The ES2 replaced this with a standard 3 barrel carburetor for 87 PS (64 kW; 86 hp) @ 5800 rpm and 13.7 kg⋅m (134 N⋅m; 99 lb⋅ft) @ 3500 rpm. Finally, the ES3 used PGM-FI for 102 PS (75 kW; 101 hp) @ 5800 rpm and 14.9 kg⋅m (146 N⋅m; 108 lb⋅ft) @ 2500 rpm.

== ET ==
The ET displaced 1.8 L; 111.6 cu in (1,829 cc) and was an SOHC 12-valve engine. ET1 had a single, downdraft carb with 4-1 exhaust manifold. The ET2 with dual sidedraft carburetors and 4-2-1 exhaust manifold produced 100 PS (74 kW; 99 hp) at 5,500 rpm and 14.4 kg⋅m (141 N⋅m; 104 lb⋅ft) at 4,000 rpm. JDM versions included a triple-barrel carburetted version for the Accord (110 PS or 81 kW or 108 hp at 5,800 rpm) and one with Honda PGM-FI which produced 130 PS (96 kW; 128 hp) at 5,800 rpm.

== EV ==
The EV displaced 1.3 L; 81.9 cu in (1,342 cc) and was an SOHC 12-valve design. 3 barrel carburetors produced 61 PS (45 kW; 60 hp) at 5,500 rpm and 10.1 kg⋅m (99 N⋅m; 73 lb⋅ft) at 3,500 rpm for the US market. The JDM version, featuring 12 valves and auxiliary CVCC valves, produced 80 PS (59 kW; 79 hp) at 6,000 rpm and 11.3 kg⋅m (111 N⋅m; 82 lb⋅ft) at 3,500 rpm. It was available in all bodystyles of the third generation Honda Civic.

== EW ==
The final E-family engine was the EW, presented along with the all new third generation Honda Civic in September 1983. Displacing 1.5 L; 90.8 cu in (1,488 cc), the EWs were SOHC 12-valve engines. Early 3 barrel EW1s produced from 58 to 76 hp (43 to 57 kW) and 11 to 11.6 kg⋅m (108 to 114 N⋅m; 80 to 84 lb⋅ft). The fuel injected EW3 and EW4 produced 92 PS (68 kW; 91 hp) at 5,500 rpm and 12.8 kg⋅m (126 N⋅m; 93 lb⋅ft) at 4,500 rpm. The "EW" name was replaced by the Honda D15 series, with the EW (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) renamed to D15A (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) in 1987. It also received a new engine stamp placement on the front of the engine like the "modern D series" (1988+).

EW5
similar to the EW1, Fuel injected CVCC 12-Valve 4 Aux valves. A third throttle plate in the throttle body supplied intake air to a 5th injector which powered the CVCC ports, The rated power is different between the Civic and the CR-X: the Civic makes 100 PS (74 kW; 99 hp) at 5800 rpm and 13.2 kg⋅m (129 N⋅m; 95 lb⋅ft) torque at 4000 rpm, the CR-X made 110 PS (81 kW; 108 hp) at 5800 rpm and 13.8 kg⋅m (135 N⋅m; 100 lb⋅ft) torque at 4500 rpm. Differences in power are largely down to a more efficient exhaust system on the CR-X it used a factory cast iron 4-2-1 extractor went through a catalytic converter further down the exhaust system and had twin exit tail pipes. The Civic had a short 4-1 design into a catalytic converter and single pipe exit. There was a revised intake manifold for vehicles produced in 1986 and 1987. The EW5 was only available in Japan. It came in the following models: CR-X 1.5i, Civic 25i Hatchback, Ballade CRi Sedan.


== ZA ==
The ZA1 and ZA2 are anomalously named, but closely related to the 1.3-litre EV. With a shorter stroke but the same bore 74 mm × 69 mm (2.91 in × 2.72 in), this 1.2 L; 72.4 cu in (1,187 cc) shared most of the EV's characteristics. It was only sold in the third generation Civic in European and various smaller markets where the taxation structure suited this version.

Title: X Factor (Albanian season 3)
Aspects: {'The X Factor 2013'}

X Factor is an Albanian television music competition to find new singing talents. The third season began on 15 September on TV Klan.
Based on the UK format, the competition consists of auditions, in front of producers and then the judges with a live audience; bootcamp; judges' houses and then the live finals. The producers' auditions for the show began on April 2013 in Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia. The winners were later called back to perform in front of the judges, held from May 19–21 in Tirana. However, the auditions were broadcast in September, when the show started airing. The show will be hosted once again by Albanian singer Alketa Vejsiu, while the judging panel consists of pop singer Altuna Sejdiu, Alban Skenderaj, Soni Malaj and Pandi Laço.
This year, the producers have decided to give more attention to the live shows, extending it to 15 weeks, and not airing bootcamp. The auditions were aired in three shows only, and then the show passed to the judges houses, airing only the finalists' bootcamp performance and result. Thus, to make the live shows longer to give the contestants more time to perform.
The other difference this year, is that there is a variety of contestants who come from different places. Sarah Memmola is from Italy, who challenged herself to take part in the X Factor Albania. There are six contestants from Macedonia this year. There is no soloist from Kosovo this year, and there is a singer from Serbia, Donika Nuhiu, for the first time in the show.

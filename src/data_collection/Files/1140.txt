== Company history ==
In 1999, the newly formed network launched B4U Movies and B4U Music in the UK on the Sky Digital platform as a subscription package along with Sony Entertainment Television. In 2001, the network went on to launch the channels in the United States and Canada and the Middle East by the end of the year.
By 2000, B4U had established itself as a leading brand in Bollywood entertainment for the Indian Diaspora. The launch was surrounded in controversy, with rival network Zee TV claiming that B4U had stolen its database of subscribers in the UK. The B4U management claimed that they had got hold of the database from ex-employees and has been using it to send mailers promoting its service. As well as expanding into Europe, Africa and Asia, the network debuted in India to popular acclaim. B4U brand awareness increased after the company signed a deal with FTV to broadcast Indian fashion shows throughout the world. The network also became involved in local level promotions like showing Indian fashion shows in theatres, promoting new faces and organising fashion shows and contests throughout India and the world. The Network gained further international attention and acclaim after winning 9 Promax Awards in 2001. By this time the B4U company was a main rival to Zee TV and Sony in the Indian broadcasting market. The network then ventured into movie production in 2002, co-producing all films produced by iDream. In addition the B4U network started to produce much more local content for the various local versions of its channels.

Aspects: {'I Cried (disambiguation)'}

"I Cried" is a song written by James Brown and Bobby Byrd. It was originally recorded in 1963 by Tammy Montgomery, better known as Tammi Terrell, for Brown's Try Me Records. It was her first charting single, reaching #99 on the Billboard Hot 100. Brown reused the song's chord progression for his 1966 hit "It's a Man's Man's Man's World". He later recorded "I Cried" himself, released in April 1971 in a version arranged by Dave Matthews that charted #15 R&B and #50 Pop. It was his final single for King Records.

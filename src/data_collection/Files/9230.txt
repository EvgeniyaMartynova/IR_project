== History ==


=== 2011–2012: Formation and early chart success ===
The formation of Nogizaka46 was first announced on June 29, 2011, when it became the first group to be labelled as the "official rival" to the group AKB48, rather than a sister group like NMB48 or SKE48. The group was named after the location of the Sony Music Japan offices near Nogizaka Station. Producer Yasushi Akimoto said that the number "46" was chosen as a direct challenge to AKB48, implying that Nogizaka46 would succeed with fewer members. In contrast to AKB48 and its sister groups, the image of Nogizaka46 is based on the Japanese people's perception of conservatively-dressed private all-girls high school students in France, which carries the connotations of elegance and refinement.Overall, 38,934 people applied to join Nogizaka46. Final auditions for the group were held from 20–21 August 2011, with 56 finalists competing for 36 available places, and 16 members joining as "senbatsu" members specially selected for performances and media appearances. On October 2, 2011, the group launched its first television variety show, titled Nogizakatte, Doko? (乃木坂って、どこ?, Lit: Where is Nogizaka?) and hosted by the comedy duo Bananaman.On February 22, 2012, Nogizaka46 released their debut single "Guruguru Curtain". It ranked second on the Oricon chart and sold 136,309 copies in the first week. Their second single, "Oide Shampoo", was released on May 2 of the same year, and became their first number one song on the Oricon weekly chart, with sales of 156,000 copies. The choreography for "Oide Shampoo" caused a brief controversy, as critics disapproved of the members lifting their skirts over their faces during one part of the performance.In June 2012, Nogizaka46 took part in Yubi Matsuri, an idol festival produced by Rino Sashihara, performing before 8,000 people at Nippon Budokan. They debuted their first musical theater production, titled 16 nin no Principal, at Shibuya Parco Theater in September 2012. By the end of 2012, Nogizaka46 reached number one on the Oricon yearly chart in the newcomers sales category, with annual sales of 870 million yen.


=== 2013–2015: Second generation and national exposure ===
Nogizaka46 held their first anniversary concert at Makuhari Messe in Chiba in February 2013, performing for 9,000 fans. From December 2012 to April 2013, an audition for the second generation of Nogizaka46 members was held, with 14 new members chosen out of 16,302 applicants. Thirteen of these new members were introduced at the musical theater performance of 16 nin no Principal deux, the sequel to the 2012 musical, in May 2013.  The group also launched their first radio program, titled Nogizaka46no, No (乃木坂46の「の」, Lit: Nogizaka46's No), and released their first photobook, titled Nogizaka Ha. The photobook, released in October, ranked fourth on the Oricon weekly book ranking with 27,000 copies sold.

In February 2014, Nogizaka46 held their second birthday concert for 13,000 fans at Yokohama Arena. During the show, the group announced that their musical 16 nin no Principal trois would open at Akasaka ACT Theater on May 30 and run until June 15. The group also released the DVD and Blu-ray versions of their first birthday concert, which reached number one on the Oricon weekly DVD chart, selling 12,000 copies in the first week. On February 24, 2014, at an AKB48 group event, it was announced that Rina Ikoma would join AKB48's Team B, and that Rena Matsui from SKE48's Team E would hold a concurrent position with Nogizaka46. On July 5, 2014, the group performed overseas for the first time, as part of a slate of Japanese performers at the Japan Expo 2014 in Paris.On January 7, 2015, Nogizaka46 released their first album Tōmei na Iro, selling over 220,000 copies in the first week. The album reached number one on the Oricon weekly albums chart. The following month, the group held their third birthday concert, this time  in from of 38,000 people at Seibu Dome in Saitama. Rina Ikoma returned to Nogizaka46, with Rena Matsui returning to SKE48. The group also launched a new television variety show, Nogizaka Kōjichū (乃木坂工事中, Lit: Nogizaka Under Construction), to replace Nogizakatte, Doko? Their first television drama, Hatsumori Bemars, premiered on the TX network in July.

From February 20 through February 22, 2016, Nogizaka46 broadcast an Internet TV program titled Nogizaka46 4th Anniversary Nogizaka 46 hours TV, in which the members produced and performed their own material for forty-six consecutive hours, on six websites simultaneously. In the week following the performance, the group's twelfth single "Taiyō Nokku" was selected for the 30th Japan Gold Disc Award.

The group promoted the second album with a second broadcast of Nogizaka 46 hours TV. On August 5, they released their second photobook, titled 1 Jikan Okure no I Love You, which sold 41,000 copies in the first week and ranked 1st on Oricon weekly book ranking.From July 19 to September 4, 2016, the 3rd generation audition took place, with 13 finalists chosen out of 48,986 applicants. The final stage of the audition involved an appeal by 13 finalists to internet audiences using the SHOWROOM internet streaming service. Twelve candidates passed the final screening.The group's fourth birthday concert was held during the last three days of their summer tour, instead of earlier in the year, due to booking issues caused by 2020 Summer Olympics construction.

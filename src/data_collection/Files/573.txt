Title: A New Day (song)
Aspects: {'A New Day'}

"A New Day" is a non-album single by English post-punk band Killing Joke. It was released by E.G. Records in July 1984 as a 12" and 7" single. The 12" single featured a dub mix of "A New Day" as the A-side and "A New Day" as the B-side. The 7" single featured a shorter version of "A New Day" as the A-side and "Dance Day" as the B-side. A completely different version of "A New Day", which was not a mix, later appeared on the 2008 reissue of Killing Joke's fifth studio album, Night Time. The single reached No. 51 in the UK Singles Chart. A promotional video was filmed for the song, marking the first time the band had made a video for a non-album single.

== Description ==
Adult males measure about 36–43 mm (1.4–1.7 in) (based on two young males) and adult females at least 54 mm (2.1 in) in snout–vent length (size of a young female). The snout is truncate in lateral profile. The tympanum is prominent. Skin is prominently tuberculate dorsally and smooth ventrally. The eyelid bears 1–2 elongated tubercles. The finger and toe discs are small; the toes have lateral fringes but no webbing. The dorsum is dull reddish brown or dull olive-brown with black and reddish brown markings. The venter is dark brown or brown dotted with (grayish) white. The posterior surfaces of the thighs are black with white or blueish white flecks.


== Habitat and conservation ==
Strabomantis cornutus occurs in cloud forests at elevations of 1,150–1,800 m (3,770–5,910 ft) above sea level. It is largely a nocturnal and terrestrial species recorded on the forest floor and stream banks. It is a rare species threatened by habitat loss caused by agriculture, human settlement, and logging. It is known from the Podocarpus National Park (Ecuador) and its range overlaps with a few other protected areas.

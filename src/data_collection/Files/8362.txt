Title: Micropterix elegans
Aspects: {'M. elegans'}

Micropterix elegans is a species of moth belonging to the family Micropterigidae that was described by Stainton in 1867, and is endemic to Israel.
Adults are important pollinators of Cyclamen persicum. They feed on pollen, copulate and oviposit within the flowers. From the rarity of buzz-pollination on their host plant, it is thought that the genus Cyclamen co-evolved with large bees capable of buzz-pollination, but lost its original pollinators for unknown historical reasons. The vacant niche was then open to various unspecialized pollen consumers such as thrips, hoverflies and small solitary bees. These are not specific to C. persicum and seem to play a minor role only, while M. elegans strictly relies upon Cyclamen and seems to be the most efficient pollinator.

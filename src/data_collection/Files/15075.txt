Title: Grote Hollandse Waard
Aspects: {'Waard'}

The Grote Waard or Zuid-Hollandse Waard was a farming region between Zuid-Holland and Brabant, that disappeared in the Sint-Elisabethsvloed (1421). Parts of this polder are now separated by water: Hoekse Waard, Eiland van Dordrecht, the Biesbosch, and parts of Noord-Brabant. The Grote Waard was a damp peat region, which was roughly limited by what now is the Afgedamde Maas between Heusden and Woudrichem, the Boven Merwede and Beneden Merwede, Dordrecht, Maasdam, the Keizersdijk between Maasdam and Strijen, Strijensas, Lage Zwaluwe, and Hooge Zwaluwe.

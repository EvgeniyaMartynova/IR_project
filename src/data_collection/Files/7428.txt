Title: Cult (Apocalyptica album)
Aspects: {'Kaamos'}

Cult is the title of the third full-length LP by the band Apocalyptica released in 2000 with a special-edition released in 2001 containing an extra disc, mixed and mastered at Finnvox. Apocalyptica's first two albums consisted mostly of cover versions; Cult was their first album to feature mainly original composition. Here, Apocalyptica also started using distortion effects much more boldly and frequently, which gave the album a more orchestral sound. There are some versions of the first release with "Path Vol. 2" as the first track and "Path" as the fourteenth. This is the last Apocalyptica album to feature Max Lilja on cello. The song "Hope Vol.2" has a music video which features scenes from the film Vidocq.

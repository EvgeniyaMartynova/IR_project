== Release ==
Released in April 2003 as a "thank you" to Japanese fans, it received a United States release the following year. Sweet stated in the liner notes of the album (which is translated in Japan as: キミがスキ・ライフ) that he wrote the album in the course of one week in January 2002, and enlisted the help of some of his Girlfriend-era bandmates during the recording. Sweet mixed, produced and engineered the album at his house. The album cover was designed by Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara. Also in the liner notes, Sweet described the album's title as an attempt at reverse Engrish: "If I did it correctly, the title should seem a little strange or wrong, but still meaningful! The true definition is supposed to be a 'love you' life, one devoted to loving someone or something, even life itself!"

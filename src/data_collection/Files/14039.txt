== History ==

The Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC) was officially formed on February 28, 1957 by organic law declaration as the result of a movement initiated by a group of professionals, businesspersons, scholars, and students.
This law establishes the principles in which the university was conceived: as a public service institution, separating it from the state's administration but with full judicial capacity.  It assigns the goal of promoting high school and higher education to create professionals, promote scientific research and extend the benefits of culture enrichment.  The law also establishes that in order to achieve such goals, the university is inspired under the principles of freedom of religion and freedom to explore, with the purposes of gathering the flowing scientific and social minds, without engaging in political, pro-militant activities.
On August 2 of the same year, the Pro University State Committee was formed and in 1959, the first university president was elected.  A year later, the schools of Pedagogy, Marine Science, and a high school were formed in Tijuana.
Between 1961 and 1962, the Schools of Economics and Commerce and Administration were incorporated in Tijuana, as well as a high school in Tecate.  In 1969, the School of Tourism was created. Between 1971 and 1979, the School of Medicine, Odontology and Chemical Sciences were formed.  In 1986, the School of Humanities was born and in 1989, the School of Engineering was built in Tecate.
Between October 1980 and January 1981, UABC was the stage of a strike movement carried out by faculty, staff and students in an effort to improve the democratic academic process and labor conditions within the university and the region.  The movement had mixed results where protests turned to riots eventually leading to the involvement of the government and police forces.  Some students, staff, and faculty were forced to leave the university.


=== Recent History ===
The Tijuana Campus was formally established in 2003 as a result of aiming to expand and solidify the academic spectrum and reach the socioeconomic and cultural needs of the region.
Today UABC exerts a fair amount of academic influence in the regional and even national scenery. It is one of the major universities in Mexico. It is composed of 3 campuses, 5 sub-campuses and 3 Units of Basic Formation.


== Governance ==
Although the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC) is a public institution of higher education, it is not under the control of the state's governmental administration, and possesses the complete legal authority to carry out its core functions: instruction; research, cultural diffusion and community service.  As defined by the university's organic law, UABC is a public service institution, decentralized from the state's administration, endowed with full autonomy, judicial personality and its own assets.


=== Administration ===
Administration of the UABC takes place in the form of a shared governance model where the entire institution is headed by a Governing Board, known as the Junta de Gobierno, as vested by the institution's own fundamental law.  A University Council, known as the Consejo Universitario serves as the collegial authority responsible of enforcing all rules and regulations established to allow the organized functionality of all administrative, staff/faculty and student affairs.  A Board of Trustees, known as Patronato Universitario serves as the chief accountant of the institution overseeing expenditures, inventory, and accountability of all resources and assets within the institution.  Student Government affairs take place in what is known as Tribunal Universitario and oversees all issues affecting the student body, including decisions and actions taken by the university governing body.
All administrative departments and operations in the UABC offices are under the final authority of the Rector and each campus operations are under the final authority of their Vice Rector, who reports to the Rector. The Governing Board is the final level of authority for all functions within the UABC.  Article 19 of UABC's organic law establishes the chain of command as follow:

III. Rector;
IV. Board of Trustees (Patronato Universitario);

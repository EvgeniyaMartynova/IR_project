Title: Thlaspi arvense
Aspects: {'T. arvense'}

Thlaspi arvense, known by the common name field pennycress, is a flowering plant in the cabbage family Brassicaceae.


== Description ==
A foetid, hairless annual plant, growing up to 60 cm (24 in) tall, with upright branches. The stem leaves are arrow-shaped, narrow and toothed. It blooms between May and July, with clusters of small white flowers. They have 4 sepals and 4 longer petals. Later it has round, flat, winged pods with a deep apical notch, measuring 1–1 cm (0.39–0.39 in)across. They contain small brown-black seeds.


== Taxonomy ==
The common name 'penny cress' is derived from the shape of the seeds looking like an old English penny.


== Distribution ==
It is native to temperate regions of Eurasia, but is a naturalized introduced species throughout temperate North America and therefore has a circumpolar distribution. In the British Isles it is regarded as an archaeophyte (an ancient introduction).


== Ecology ==
Field pennycress is a weed of cultivated land and wasteland.


== Edible uses ==
The field pennycress has a bitter taste; it is usually parboiled to remove the bitter taste. This is mostly used in salads, sometimes in sandwich spreads. It is said to have a distinctive flavour.


== Use as a source of biodiesel ==
Pennycress is being developed as an oilseed crop for production of renewable fuels. The species can be planted in the fall, will germinate and form a vegetative mass which can overwinter. In the spring, the oil-rich seed can be harvested and used as a biodiesel feedstock.


== Research ==
Pennycress is related to the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Researchers have begun studying the genetics of pennycress in order to improve its potential use as a biofuel crop. For example, the transcriptome of pennycress has been sequenced.

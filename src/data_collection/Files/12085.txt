Title: R36 (South Africa)
Aspects: {'R36'}

The R36 is a provincial route in South Africa that connects the N1 (between Louis Trichardt and Polokwane) with Ermelo, via Tzaneen and Lydenburg. It is co-signed with the N4 for 50 kilometres between Machadodorp and Patattanek, with a tollgate on this section. It used to extend further south past Ermelo to Amersfoort, but this is now designated as part of the N11.

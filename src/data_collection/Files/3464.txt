Title: F-factor (conversion factor)
Aspects: {'F-factor'}

The F-factor, in diagnostic radiology, is the conversion factor between exposure and absorbed dose.  In other words, it converts between the amount of ionization in air (roentgens or coulombs/kg) and the absorbed dose in air (rads or grays).  The two determinants of the F-factor are the effective Z of the material and the type of ionizing radiation being considered.  Since the effective Z of air and soft tissue is approximately the same, the F-factor is approximately 1 for many x-ray imaging applications.  However, bone has an F-factor of up to 4, due to its higher effective Z.

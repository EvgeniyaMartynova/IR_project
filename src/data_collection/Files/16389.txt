== Lyrics ==
The song shows Lamar expressing his inner thoughts, a subject he rarely touches upon in interviews.In the lyrics, Lamar calls out Fox News' reporter Geraldo Rivera, who criticized Lamar's performance of "Alright" at the BET Awards 2015.The song makes multiple references to religion, a theme Lamar would reference multiple times throughout Damn. Lamar specifically references the Book of Deuteronomy, the fifth book from the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. Lamar mentions his cousin, Carl Duckworth, who teaches Lamar about the Book of Deuteronomy and how the book talks about penalties for breaking the rule of God. A voicemail snippet from Carl appears in the song "Fear", also from Damn, during which he espouses the beliefs of the Hebrew Israelite group where he is a member. At one point, Lamar raps "I'm a Israelite, don't call me black no mo'," which is a clear reference to Black Israelism.According to Spin magazine, the song drew influence from American rapper Kanye West's song "Jesus Walks" from his first studio album The College Dropout, a song that also drew biblical allusions.

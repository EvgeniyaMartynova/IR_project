Title: R13 (drug)
Aspects: {'R13'}

R13 is a small-molecule flavonoid and orally active, potent, and selective agonist of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) – the main signaling receptor for the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) – which is under development for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It is a structural modification and prodrug of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) with improved potency and pharmacokinetics, namely oral bioavailability and duration. The compound is a replacement for the earlier 7,8-DHF prodrug R7 and has similar properties to it. It was developed because while R7 displayed a good drug profile in animal studies, it showed almost no conversion into 7,8-DHF in human liver microsomes. In contrast to R7, R13 is readily hydrolyzed into 7,8-DHF in human liver microsomes.

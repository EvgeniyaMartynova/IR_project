Title: Klebsormidium
Aspects: {'K. elegans'}

Klebsormidium is a genus of filamentous charophyte green algae comprising 20 species. The name was proposed in 1972 to resolve confusion in application and status of Hormidium. It occurs mostly in soil and on moist substrates, nevertheless, aquatic and one marine species are also known. Many Klebsormidium-species are able to synthesize substances for UV protection, the so-called mycosporine-like amino acids. The draft genome sequence of Klebsormidium flaccidum was published in 2014.

Aspects: {'Na Na Na'}

24/Seven is the third studio album released by American boy band Big Time Rush, released on June 11, 2013 by Columbia Records before the group's indefinite hiatus. The album experiments with a dance-rock and R&B sound. It also serves as the follow-up to their second studio album Elevate. The band worked with producers Matt Squire and Damon Sharpe, as they had done in the past, in an effort to mature their sound yet not stray away from their well-known qualities. The four members co-wrote thirteen songs (including five deluxe edition bonus tracks) with several hired songwriters.

Musically, 24/Seven marks a shift on the band's signature sound showcasing a more mature, organic and "down-to-earth pop" direction than their previous two albums, BTR and Elevate. In contrast with their past releases, the songs were written primarily by the band, with the exception of the songs "Like Nobody's Around" and "Song for You", each song on the album was either written or co-written by a member of the band. The album features duo Karmin, which appears on the track "Song for You", and rapper Jake Miller on deluxe edition bonus track "Lost in Love". The first version of the song "Love Me Again" was written by Big Time Rush, but Nickelodeon altered the song to be more "kid-friendly".

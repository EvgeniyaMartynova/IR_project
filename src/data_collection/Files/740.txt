== Reception ==
"B-Sides and Rarities is an overall resounding effort by perhaps the smartest members of the now moribund Nü-Metal genre", said Ayo Jegede of Stylus Magazine. He went on to say, "Each of these B-sides and alternates replicates a period in their career, so while the songs themselves may be new, they perfectly encapsulate each album of the band’s catalogue as though they were overarching epochs".

Title: Alacarte
Aspects: {'Ã€ la carte (disambiguation)'}

Alacarte (previously the Simple Menu Editor for GNOME or SMEG) is a menu editor for the GNOME desktop, written in Python. It has been part of GNOME since the 2.16 release.
The menu "Places" is not available for editing.
You can edit the places menu somewhat with this: $gedit ~/.gtk-bookmarks,
or use gconf-editor (e.g. /system/storage/drives/_org_freedesktop_.../mount_options).
An alternative to Alacarte is MenuLibre.

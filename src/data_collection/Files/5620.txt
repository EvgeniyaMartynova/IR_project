== Singles ==
"Me and the Moon" was released as the album's first single on 10 August 2015. Filan has said of the song; "What I love about it is that it has a universal meaning. It's about losing someone you love, but it could be that you've lost a relationship, or someone has died, or you could be miles away from your loved ones on the other side of the world. I can really relate to it in that sense."

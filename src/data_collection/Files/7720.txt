Title: Larinioides cornutus
Aspects: {'L. cornutus'}

Larinioides cornutus, the furrow spider, furrow orb spider, or foliate spider is an orb-weaver spider with Holarctic distribution.
Females reach a body length of about 6–14 mm, males up to 5–9 mm. Leg spans range from 18 to 35 mm.These spiders are most often found in moist areas, especially near water.  The web is built between grass or in low shrubbery. They hide during the day in a silken retreat that opens at the bottom, masked with plant and animal matter and leave it during the night. The web is remade in the evening.

The male lives with the female during mating time, which is in autumn and again in spring. The female produces three to five yellow egg sacs during the summer.There is possibly a distinct species L. folium, which is very similar but occurs in dry habitat.

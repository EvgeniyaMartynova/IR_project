Title: Haplogroup R-Z18
Aspects: {'Z18'}

R-Z18 is a subclade of the R-U106 branch of Haplogroup R.
It includes all men who have the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) designated Z18 in their Y chromosome.  
Z18, also called S493, is defined to be mutation in which the nucleotide at position 14,991,735 along the Y chromosome has mutated from guanine (G) to adenine (A).  
Z18 was discovered during Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project, and entered on 16 August 2014 into the SNP database dbSNP at the National Center for Biotechnology Information as reference SNP cluster report rs767290651.R-U106 is one of the major sub groups of R1b in coastal Western Europe, but Z18 is only about 5-10% of U106.  
R-Z18 has its highest concentrations in the Netherlands and Northern Germany, although there are also samples in southern Sweden and northern Britain.
On the basis of genetic results, the first carrier of this mutation lived around 2200 B.C., with a 90% confidence range of 3000 B.C. to 1400 B.C.Major known subclades of R-Z18 include R-ZP156, R-S11601, R-DF95, R-FGC7637, R-Z2396, R-S6119 and R-Z17.  although they continue to increase as more are found.

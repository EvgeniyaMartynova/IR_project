Title: Primula
Aspects: {'P. nivalis'}

Primula  is a genus of mainly herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. They include the familiar wildflower of banks and verges, the primrose (P. vulgaris). Other common species are P. auricula (auricula), P. veris (cowslip) and P. elatior (oxlip). These species and many others are valued for their ornamental flowers. They have been extensively cultivated and hybridised - in the case of the primrose, for many hundreds of years.  Primula are native to the temperate northern hemisphere, south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia, Indonesia and New Guinea, and in temperate southern South America. Almost half of the known species are from the Himalayas.Primula has about 500 species in traditional treatments, and more if certain related genera are included within its circumscription.


== Description ==
Primula is a complex and varied genus, with a range of habitats from alpine slopes to boggy meadows. Plants bloom mostly during the spring, with flowers often appearing in spherical umbels on stout stems arising from basal rosettes of leaves; their flowers can be purple, yellow, red, pink, blue, or white. Some species show a white mealy bloom (farina) on various parts of the plant. Many species are adapted to alpine climates.


== Etymology ==
The word primula is the Latin feminine diminutive of primus, meaning first (prime), applied to flowers that are among the first to open in spring.


== Ecology ==
Primulas are used as a food plant by the Duke of Burgundy butterfly.


== Garden hybrids and cultivars ==
Primula species have been extensively cultivated and hybridised, mainly derived from P. elatior, P. juliae, P. veris and P. vulgaris. Polyanthus (often called P. polyantha) is one such group of plants, which has produced a large variety of strains in all colours, usually grown as annuals or biennials and available as seeds or young plants.The following hybrid varieties and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-


== Classification ==
The genus Dodecatheon originated from within Primula, so some authorities include the 14 species of Dodecatheon in Primula.


=== Sections of genus Primula ===
The classification of the genus Primula has been investigated by botanists for over a century. As the genus is both large and diverse (with about 500 species), botanists have organized the species in various sub-generic groups. The most common is division into a series of thirty sections. Some of these sections (e.g. Vernales, Auricula) contain many species; others contain only one.


=== Selected species ===
Species include:


=== Hybrids ===
Primula × kewensis = P. floribunda × P. verticillata (Kew primrose)
Primula × polyantha = P. veris × P. vulgaris (false oxlip, polyanthus primula)
Primula × pubescens = P. hirsuta × P. auricula

Title: Fuzuli District
Aspects: {'Yağləvənd'}

Fuzuli or Fizuli is a rayon of Azerbaijan. It was named after the Azerbaijani poet Fuzûlî. Its capital is the town of Füzuli. The western half, including the capital, has been controlled by the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh ever since as part of its Hadrut Province, since the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Horadiz is temporarily center of Fuzuli Rayon due to Fuzuli's occupation by Armenian forces since 23 August 1993.
IDPs from Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions were  moved to Fuzuli rayon from tent settlements around the country. The IDPs live in new houses built by the government.

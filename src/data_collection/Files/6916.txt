Title: Malaysian State Roads system
Aspects: {'K road'}

Malaysian State Roads System (Malay: Sistem Laluan Negeri Malaysia) are the secondary roads in Malaysia. The construction of state roads in Malaysia is funded by Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) of each state. The standard of the state roads is similar with the federal roads except for the coding system, where the codes for state roads begin with state codes followed by route number, for example Johor State Route J32 is labeled as J32. If a state road crosses the state border, the state code will change, for example route B20 in Salak Tinggi, Selangor will change to N20 after crossing the border of Negeri Sembilan to Nilai.

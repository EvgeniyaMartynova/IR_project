== Distribution and habitat ==
This snail is endemic to Cuba. These arboreal molluscs live mainly in coastal habitats in the subtropical forest, with a preference for certain tree species including Chrysobalanus icaco, Metopium toxifera, Metopium brownei, Bursera simarouba and Coccoloba retusa.


== Description ==
Shells of Polymita picta can reach a length of about 20 millimetres (0.79 in). These large shells are shiny and very brightly colored. Normally they show a bright yellow color with a white stripe, but the species is well known for its colourful shell polymorphism, with numerous color varieties.These shells are sought after by poachers and used to make jewelry and trinkets. As a result, the species has become endangered. It is a protected species since 1943 by the Cuban legislation which prohibits the export except for scientific reasons.


== Biology ==

Polymita picta mainly feeds on lichen, moss and on fungal biofilms present on bark and leaves. The life cycle lasts about 15 months, with breeding time during the wet season (September- October). The snails become dormant in the dry season (December- beginning of May).Like most air-breathing land snails, Polymita picta has female and male reproductive organs (hermaphroditic),  it is unable to self-fertilization. Moreover similarly to other gastropods in the superfamily Helicoidea, this species uses love darts as part of its mating behavior.  During the courtship these snails spear the partner with a calcareous dart.

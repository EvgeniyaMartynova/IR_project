Title: List of Ariane launches
Aspects: {'V19', 'V80', 'V81'}

Rockets from the Ariane family have accumulated 246 launches since 1979, 234 of which were successful, yielding a 95.1% success rate. The currently operational version, Ariane 5, has flown 82 consecutive missions without failure between April 2003 and December 2017, but suffered a malfunction during flight VA-241 in January 2018, causing its two satellites to reach an incorrect orbit, and reducing their predicted lifetime as they consumed some of their own fuel to raise their orbits.

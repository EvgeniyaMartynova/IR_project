Title: M2K Mini Tour
Aspects: {'M2K'}

The M2K Tour was a mini tour by American heavy metal band Metallica. The tour ran from late December 1999 to early January 2000. During the tour, "Trapped Under Ice" was requested to be played when they were in Chicago by a fan. The song was only played two other times: on November 17, 1984 in Belgium, and on November 18, 1984 in Paris. Metallica also played the New Year's Eve show in Pontiac, Michigan at the Silverdome in front of 50,000 people. At the show, Metallica broadcast the Times Square Ball Drop, ushering in the year 2000, and played the classic Kiss track "Detroit Rock City" alongside Ted Nugent, Kid Rock, and Sevendust. The setlists for these tour dates, like their Sick of the Studio '07 tour, consisted of old songs and songs that they have not played in many years.

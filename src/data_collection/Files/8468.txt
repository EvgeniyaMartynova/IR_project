Title: Indian spotted chevrotain
Aspects: {'M. indica'}

The Indian spotted chevrotain (Moschiola indica) is a species of even-toed ungulate in the family Tragulidae found in India and possibly Nepal. It has a body length of 23 in (57.5 cm), with a tail length of 1 in (2.5 cm); it weighs around 7 lb (3 kg). It lives in rainforests and is nocturnal. This was earlier included under the name of Tragulus meminna, but studies on the systematics of the group have led to that name being restricted to the Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain.

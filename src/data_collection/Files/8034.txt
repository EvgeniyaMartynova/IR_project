SS Pierre L'Enfant (Hull Number 1001) was a Liberty ship built in the United States during World War II. She was named after Pierre L'Enfant, a French-born American architect who designed what is today Washington D.C.
The ship was laid down on 17 May 1943, and launched on 11 June 1943. The ship survived the war, even shooting down three enemy aircraft, and was sold into private ownership in 1947.  However, in 1970, the ship was wrecked and subsequently abandoned.

Title: V Live (website)
Aspects: {'V Live'}

V Live (stylized as VLIVE), sometimes referred to as V App, is a South Korean live video streaming service that allows celebrities based in the country to broadcast live videos on the internet and live chat with fans. Streaming is available online or on Android and iOS mobile devices, with replays formerly available on PC (no longer available on some computers due to its utilization of Flash Videos). The company is owned by Naver Corporation and was launched in late August 2015.


== History ==
In 2007, Naver Corporation launched its video platform channel, but availability was highly restricted and unavailable in many countries.In early August 2015, Naver Corporation released the live streaming app, V Live. The application was originally available only on the Google Play Store for Android, but later launched on iTunes. The app was aimed at reaching international fan bases, particularly those in Japan, China, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Therefore, there were no region restrictions and the website had a variety of language options, such as English, Chinese and Japanese.
According to Sensor Tower, the application had 200,000 downloads and earned $600,000 in Aug 2017; by May 2018, the V Live app had over 1 million downloads on the Google Play Store and iTunes.


== Services and features ==
V Live has over 700 channels associated with different K-pop stars, including  BTS, Exo, Got7, Big Bang, Monsta X, BtoB, Astro, T-ara, Blackpink, NCT, Twice, Iz One and Seventeen as well as several actors, such as Lee Jong-suk, Lee Dong-wook, and Park Bo-young. V Live may broadcast programs that range from live chat sessions with fans, performances, reality shows, and award shows.
V Live makes it easy for fans to interact with the website. Users are alerted when a channel they follow begins a live stream or uploads new content. Users can also comment or send hearts on videos, which the idol or idols can also see in real time. Every interaction contributes to the user's "chemi-beat". The chemi-beat tracks the users chemistry with a celebrity. Users can increase their chemi-beat by regularly engaging with a channel, turning on push notifications and sharing videos. Having a high chemi-beat increases the user's chances of winning an event hosted by an idol.


=== V Live+ (Plus) ===
V Live+ refers to paid content types that offer unreleased, downloadable and fan catered content. V Live+ content can be purchased with V coins, which roughly amount to 50 for US$1, or redeemed using a code presented with an external purchase, such as an album.


=== CH+ (Channel+) ===
Some idols also offer CH+, a premium channel that can only be accessed with a subscription. CH+ channels can be purchased with V coins on a 30-day, 3 month, 6 month or yearly basis. CH+ channels differ from regular channels in that they provide hidden broadcasts, videos and posts.Reality shows that have aired exclusively on V Live CH+ include Real GOT7 and BTS: Bon Voyage.Behind the scenes of VLive-only dramas can also be seen in the CH+ channel. For example: Welcome to Heal Inn and We See Winter, both series with Fromis 9.

The V Lightstick provides the user with double the “hearts” when tapped, a special on-screen effect when heart milestones are hit and a 3 dimensional interactive object representing the lightstick. 1-day and 30-day passes are available for purchase in the STORE for 50 coins and 150 coins respectively.

=== V Fansubs ===
V Fansubs refers to the subtitling service that allows users to submit their own foreign-language subtitle translations for V Live videos. These subtitles are reviewed by a team from V Fansubs before they are uploaded onto V Live. This subtitling feature has been a significant aspect of V Live’s growth, attracting a large international fanbase outside of South Korea.


=== Chemi-beat ===
Chemi-beat refers to the level of “chemistry and beat” a user has with a certain channel. This corresponds to the amounts of interaction a user has with a certain channel. There are seven levels of Chemi-beat which a user can obtain. In additional, all users of each channel are ranked based on their Chemi-beat. These ranks are updated daily and the TOP 100 users are displayed on each channel’s home page.While there are currently no additional benefits based on Chemi-beat, V Live has stated they have plans to provide additional benefits in the future.


== Awards ==
The platform holds yearly awards, colloquially called the V Live Awards, to honor the most popular people and content on the website. The primary awards, the Global Top 10 and Rookie Top 5, are awarded to the top-ten most popular V Live channels, the latter specifically for new artists. The fifteen channels hold an individual broadcast where they receive the award. Additional popularity awards are selected via online voting.


== Influence on Hallyu ==

V Live is a medium in which Korean celebrities can reach a global audience and has allowed non-Korean speaking fans worldwide to intimately interact with their favorite Hallyu idols. There is an online community on V Live for fan translators who create foreign subtitles so that more people can enjoy the content worldwide. Translators are ranked by the number of lines that they have translated. The subtitling process is made user-friendly so that fans do not need any specific technical skills. Contests and events are held to encourage fan-subbing. For example, fan translators in the past have won V coins and video calls with their favorite idols. Because of fan translators, some videos have as many as 17 subtitle options.According to Alexa Internet, only 18% of users come from South Korea, while 9.4% come from China, 8.5% are from the United States, 5.9% are from Indonesia, and 5.7% are from Thailand.

Moreover, V Live launched special mini-concerts called "V Heartbeat" to connect K-pop and V-pop star together. The first opening show they invited Winner to perform in Vietnam.

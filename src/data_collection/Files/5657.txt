Title: Can't Stop Lovin' You
Aspects: {"I Can't Stop Loving You (disambiguation)"}

"Can't Stop Lovin' You" is a song by American hard rock band Van Halen.  It was released in 1995 as the third single from their tenth album Balance.
The song emerged after producer Bruce Fairbairn asked for a more pop-oriented song. Instead of searching for his archives, Eddie Van Halen decided to write new music from scratch. The song was written by all members of Van Halen and is about everlasting love and friendship.  The song pays homage to Ray Charles' song "I Can't Stop Loving You", particularly in the line where Sammy Hagar sings "Hey Ray, what you said is true..."
The song was Van Halen's most successful single from Balance in the United States, being the only single which reached the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 30. This would be Van Halen's last song to reach the Top 40 in the United States. The song also reached number three on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart.


== Music video ==
The video, directed by Peter Christopherson, is set in an average middle class American home, where it goes back and forth between the band performing the song and people showing their affection for one another, from an old couple celebrating their anniversary, to a teen couple, to a boy and his dog, to a woman and her pet monkey.  There is also a moving moment in the video in which a girl mourns the loss of her dog.
In the beginning of the video, it shows a man taking a gun and his wife worried. In the end, the video shows his wife and his son waiting for him as he leaves the prison. What he did and his time in prison are shown in the video of the song "Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)".


== Legacy ==
The song was performed considerably on the 1995 Ambulance Tour with Sammy Hagar.  It was featured on both Van Halen compilations Best Of â€“ Volume I and The Best of Both Worlds.

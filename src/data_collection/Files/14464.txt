==== V60 Polestar ====
In 2013 Volvo unveiled a special, limited version of the V60 called V60 Polestar. It is a reworked V60 that was developed by Polestar and went on sale in 2014 in limited markets only.

Cosmetic changes include custom 20" alloy wheels, a different front and rear splitter and contrasting coloured interior stitching. When first introduced the only available paint colours were black metallic or "Rebel Blue", later white and silver metallic colours were added.
In 2016, the model year 2017 V60 Polestar received an all new four cylinder 2.0 litre turbo engine replacing the old 3.0 litre six cylinder.

		


==== V60 Plug-in Hybrid ====
A pre-production version of the Volvo V60 diesel-electric transmission plug-in hybrid was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2011. The V60 plug in is the result of close cooperation between Volvo Cars and Swedish energy supplier Vattenfall. The V60 plug-in has a price of around €50,000 (GB£40,000, US$64,600).In September 2012, Volvo announced that the first 1,000 units were sold out before the model year 2013 vehicles were delivered to the dealerships. The carmaker ramped up production of the 2014 model year to 5,000 units for 2013. The first 1,000 units of the Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid were part of a "Pure Limited" edition with electric silver livery. The diesel electric car also has aero designed 17 inch wheels, integrated exhaust tailpipes and a number of bodywork features in glossy black.The V60 Plug in Hybrid features a six speed automatic transmission and the front wheels are driven by a five-cylinder 2.4 litre D5 turbo diesel, which produces 215 hp and maximum torque of 440 Nm. The rear axle features ERAD (Electric Rear Axle Drive) in the form of an electric motor producing 70 hp and maximum torque of 200 Nm, powered from a 12 kWh lithium-ion battery pack.
Volvo expects to achieve an all-electric range of up to 50 km (31 mi), and a fuel economy of 124 miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (1.8 l/100 km), with carbon dioxide emissions averaging 49 g/km. The interaction between diesel and electric power is handled via a control system, and the driver has the option to choose the preferred driving mode via three buttons on the instrument panel: Pure, Hybrid and Power.
In Pure Mode, the car runs only on its electric motor as much as possible. The driving range is up to 50 km (31 mi). Battery range varies with terrain, climate and driving style.
Hybrid Mode is the default mode whenever the car is started. The diesel engine and electric motor interact to provide a balance between driving pleasure and low environmental impact. Emissions of CO2 are 49 g/km (EU Combined), corresponding to diesel fuel consumption of 1.8 l/100 km. The car's total range is up to 1,200 kilometres (750 mi).
In Power Mode, the hybrid system is optimised to give the car the best possible performance. The electric motor's quick torque delivery contributes to the car's 0 to 100 km/h acceleration time of 6.1 seconds.In April 2014, Volvo announced the addition of an R Design version of its V60 Plug in Hybrid, which features a number of unique interior and exterior features that create a sporty look.

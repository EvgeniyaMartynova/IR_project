KHTE-FM is a commercial urban contemporary radio station licensed in England, Arkansas, United States, broadcasting to the Little Rock, Arkansas, area on 96.5 FM. KHTE-FM is currently branded as "96.5 The Box". The station's studios are located in West Little Rock, and the transmitter tower is in Redfield, Arkansas.
KHTE-FM, whose previous formats were Rhythmic contemporary and later Urban contemporary known as "Hot 96.5", began switching directions to a 1990s-based Top 40 format in August 2009, only to adopt an Adult Top 40 direction just two weeks after the flip, and by 2011 evolved to Top 40/CHR. The move allowed them to compete more effectively with Top 40 rival KLAL for 18- to 49-year-old female listeners and to counter KLAL's modern-leaning playlist.
In January 2013, KHTE-FM dropped Top 40/CHR for News/Talk, picking up the format full time from KKSP after it went full-time with their sports format.
On March 17, 2015, it was announced that Salem Media Group, will take over operations of KHTE and KKSP through a local marketing agreement with Crain. On April 2, 2015, KHTE-FM rebranded as "96.5 The Answer", matching the names of fellow stations owned by Salem.On August 1, 2018, KHTE changed their format to urban contemporary, branded as "96.5 The Box".

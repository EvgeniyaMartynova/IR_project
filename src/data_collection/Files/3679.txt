Title: Ferrari F14 T
Aspects: {'F14'}

The Ferrari F14 T (also known by its internal name, Project Code 665) is a Formula One racing car designed by Nikolas Tombazis, Rory Byrne and James Allison for Ferrari to compete in the 2014 Formula One season. It was driven by former World Drivers' Champions Fernando Alonso and Kimi Räikkönen, who returned to the team after a five-year absence. The F14 T was designed to use Ferrari's new 1.6-litre V6 turbocharged engine, the 059/3, replacing the 2.4 litre V8 from the F138.The name of the car was chosen by fans in a poll organised by Ferrari. The "14" represents the year of competition, and the "T" reflects the series' shift to a turbocharged engine formula.The F14 T was the first turbo powered Formula One car for Ferrari since the Gustav Brunner designed F1/87/88C driven by Michele Alboreto and Gerhard Berger in 1988. Even with the lineup of Alonso and Räikkönen, the car was not successful, scoring only 2 podium finishes (both by Alonso) in the entire season. It was also the first Ferrari machine since the Ferrari F93A, from 1993, that failed to score at least one Grand Prix win. A lot of technical changes were made, with the KERS and ERS systems working with the 1.6 litre V6 turbocharged engine, an 8-speed gearbox and a more powerful DRS system . All this power goes to the rear wheels. Sadly, the car did not do well in the Formula 1 season. It did not win a single Grand Prix and had 4 retirements.


== Design ==
The F14 T was unveiled on 25 January 2014. Like all 2014 Formula One cars, the F14 T featured a lower nose, with a flatter concept compared to other 2014 cars. Ferrari retained their pullrod front suspension, despite reports that it would be dropped. The rear was revised to accommodate the new powerplant and rear wing rules.

Title: A Night in Venice (1934 film)
Aspects: {'A Night in Venice'}

A Night in Venice  (German: Eine Nacht in Venedig) is a 1934 German-Hungarian operetta film directed by Robert Wiene and starring Tino Pattiera, Tina Eilers and Ludwig Stössel. It is loosely based on the 1883 operetta Eine Nacht in Venedig by Johann Strauss II.
It was made at the Hunnia Studios in Budapest with three weeks of location shooting in Venice. In common with the practice of multi-language versions at the time, the film was also made in a separate Hungarian language version Egy éj Velencében based on the same screenplay. The Hunnia Studios specialised in such co-productions during the era. The two versions were shot simultaneously. The Hungarian version was co-directed by Wiene and Géza von Cziffra and used a separate cast of Hungarian actors.
The film appears to have been popular with Austrian and German audiences, although its critical reception was less enthusiastic.

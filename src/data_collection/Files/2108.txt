Title: D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose-7-phosphate kinase
Aspects: {'D-beta-D-heptose 7-phosphate kinase/D-beta-D-heptose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase'}

D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose-7-phosphate kinase (EC 2.7.1.167, heptose 7-phosphate kinase, D-beta-D-heptose 7-phosphotransferase, D-beta-D-heptose-7-phosphate kinase, HldE1 heptokinase, glycero-manno-heptose 7-phosphate kinase, D-beta-D-heptose 7-phosphate kinase/D-beta-D-heptose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, hldE (gene), rfaE (gene)) is an enzyme with systematic name ATP:D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate + ATP

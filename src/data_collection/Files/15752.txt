Title: Fujifilm X100
Aspects: {'X100'}

The Fujifilm X100 is a series of digital compact cameras with a fixed prime lens. The series includes the FinePix X100, X100S, X100T and X100F. They each have a large image sensor and a 23 mm lens (35 mm equivalent angle of view in full frame format). All four cameras have received generally positive reviews.


== Fujifilm FinePix X100 ==
The Fujifilm FinePix X100 was initially shown at the photokina show in September 2010 and was subsequently introduced in February 2011. It was the first model in the Fujifilm X-series of cameras and has since been joined by numerous models. It is superseded by the Fujifilm X100S.


=== Key features ===
12.3 MP, APS-C sized CMOS sensor
Hybrid optical/electric viewfinder
23 mm (35 mm equivalent angle of view (AOV) in 35 mm full frame format) fixed prime lens
Classic styling


=== Innovation ===
The FinePix X100 was the first camera to show a number of new technologies developed by Fujifilm. These include a hybrid viewfinder which allows the user to choose between a conventional optical viewfinder with an electronic overlay, or an electronic viewfinder. The combination of APS-C sized CMOS sensor, EXR processor and 23mm (35 mm equivalent) fast aperture lens was also a first.


=== Reception ===
The X100 received generally favourable reviews and a number of awards. These include Innovative Camera of the Year from Ephotozine and Best Premium Camera in the 2011 TIPA awards.
In most cases, the prizes were awarded for the combination of technology and picture quality, but the X100 has also received plaudits for its design outside the photography market, coming top of Stuff magazine's Cool List for 2011 and in October 2012 receiving Good Design Award from Good Design Award (Japan).Digital Photography Review gave it a score of 75% and a silver award, noting that it "combines excellent image quality, solid build and a superb viewfinder with somewhat sluggish and quirky operation", adding that "It's been much improved by multiple firmware updates since its initial incarnation, and despite its flaws, is now a very likeable camera indeed.".


=== Issues ===
Some X100 cameras have reportedly suffered from 'sticky aperture disease' where the aperture blades lock up, leading to overexposure. Fujifilm has acknowledged this issue and will fix it under warranty.
On initial release the X100 was widely reported to have various issues. Many, but not all, of these issues were fixed through a series of firmware updates made available by Fujifilm.


== Fujifilm X100S ==
The Fujifilm X100S is the successor to the Fujifilm FinePix X100. Announced in January 2013, it is a model similar to the X100 yet addressing some of the issues that the X100 had, and resembles it superficially, but with internal changes. It has been compared with the Leica M series.It was replaced in September 2014 with the Fujifilm X100T.


=== Differences from the X100 ===

16.3 MP Fujifilm X-Trans CMOS II sensor instead of 12.3 MP CMOS sensor with primary colour filter (Bayer filter)
Redesign of menus
Quick Menu (Q) button
Uses X-Trans color filter pattern (taken from the X-E1 and X-Pro1), instead of Bayer pattern
No optical low pass filter (OLPF), to give sharper images
Phase detection within the X-Trans CMOS II sensor increasing autofocus speed to 0.08 s in good light
The faster the focus ring is rotated, the quicker the focus is adjusted
Focus mode switch options have been reorganised such that the most commonly used functions (Autofocus Single and Manual Focus) surround the least used function (Autofocus Continuous) for more efficient operation
Hybrid viewfinder switch has been altered in shape to allow for easier one-handed operation
Autofocus point selection has been altered to allow one button default access


=== Reception ===
The X100S received generally positive reviews: 

Digital Photography Review gave it a score of 81% and a gold award, describing it as a "hugely likable, very capable camera with some useful tricks up its sleeve".
Photography Life gave it 4.6 stars out of 5, describing it as "an amazing camera".


== Fujifilm X100T ==
The Fujifilm X100T was announced by Fujifilm on September 10, 2014. It is the successor to the X100S.  It is visually very similar to the X100S, and shares many of its core specifications (including its lens and sensor), but features numerous iterative refinements and enhancements. It has the same 16.3 MP Fujifilm X-Trans CMOS II sensor as the X100S.It was replaced in January 2017 with the Fujifilm X100F.


=== Differences from the X100S ===

Advanced hybrid viewfinder, with electronic rangefinder
Real-time parallax correction in optical viewfinder
±3EV exposure compensation
optional electronic shutter (allowing silent operation and a shutter speed of 1/32000 of a second)
3.0-inch, 1040K-dot LCD screen
"Classic Chrome" film simulation mode
Built-in Wi-Fi
Face recognition (when enabled, focuses automatically on the faces in the frame)


=== Reception ===
The X100T has received generally positive reviews:

Digital Photography Review gave it a score of 81%, criticising its autofocus and video capabilities but noting "there's currently nothing to touch it in terms of the size/price/image quality balance it offers and the style with which it does so".
Pocket-Lint.com gave it 4 stars out of 5, describing it as "a special little camera"


== Fujifilm X100F ==
The Fujifilm X100F, announced on January 19, 2017 is the successor to the Fujifilm X100T. It features a number of improvements and refinements over the previous model, many of which were first introduced with the Fujifilm X-Pro2. The X100F was released on February 23, 2017.


=== Differences from the X100T ===

A third-generation 24.3 MP X-Trans CMOS III sensor
X-Processor Pro image processor
A new button layout with a joystick autofocus control (similar to X-Pro2 and X-T2), making it easier to select AF points
Built-In ISO dial
Added command dial on the front of the camera
C mode on exposure compensation dial, allowing up to 5 stops exposure compensation
A larger battery, model NP-W126S (same as X-T2)
An improved 91-point autofocus system
Improved sensitivity (ISO 200–12800, expandable to ISO 100–51200)
Viewfinder has 6x magnification
Acros film simulation
60 fps EVF refresh rate
Additional continuous shooting mode speeds (3, 4, 5, and 8 fps) along with larger buffer
New LED AF lamp
Digital teleconverter simulating 50mm and 70mm perspectives (JPG only)


=== Reception ===
The X100F was very well received, mostly for its improved sensor and autofocus capability. Digital Photography Review gave it a score of 83% and a gold award, calling it "a true photographers' camera". At the 2017 Technical Image Press Association Awards, the X100F won the award for best professional compact camera.


== Accessories ==
Due to their similarities, the different X100 cameras accept many of the same accessories.


=== Conversion lenses ===
Wide Conversion Lens WCL-X100 II - gives a magnification factor to the 23 mm fixed lens of 0.8×, providing a focal length of 19 mm (28 mm equivalent angle of view (AOV)
Tele Conversion Lens TCL-X100 II - multiplies the 23 mm fixed lens by approximately 1.4×, providing an equivalent focal length of 33 mm (50 mm equivalent angle of view)


=== Flashguns ===
Fujifilm EF-20
Fujifilm EF-X20
Fujifilm EF-42

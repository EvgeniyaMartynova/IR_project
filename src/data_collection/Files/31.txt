== Overview ==
Malcolm Middleton commented on the song:

We all get comfort from knowing that other people are uncomfy too. This idea is most evident in the title track, "A Brighter Beat". To me, it's a support anthem for people who find it hard leaving the house sometimes or socialising in general. If you're on your own at home and feeling depressed it's funny to think that there's millions of other people feeling exactly the same.

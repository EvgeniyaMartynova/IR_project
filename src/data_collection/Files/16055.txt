Title: XEEW-FM
Aspects: {'XEEW'}

XEEW-FM (branded as Los 40) is a Latin Top 40 radio station that serves the Matamoros-Brownsville Metropolitan Area. The station was founded in 1978 by Radiodifusoras del Bajo Bravo and is operated today by RadioDual S.A. de C.V. The station underwent a format change on 17 January 2010 and became affiliated with Televisa Radio under its music radio brand of Los 40 Principales, which is licensed from Grupo PRISA of Spain, thus becoming part of the largest network of Spanish-language music radio stations in the world.
Unlike its other affiliates in Mexico, the station airs its own playlist of both Spanish language and English language pop music along with its own local on-air personalities. The station does, however, air the morning show, "Ya PÃ¡rate" (Get up now), and the afternoon show "El Tlacuache" (The Opossum) from the national feed.

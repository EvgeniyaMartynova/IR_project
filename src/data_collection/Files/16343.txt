== History ==

Yaga Gathering was originally a psychedelic trance music festival called Shambala Festival—named for the mythical hidden kingdom of Shambhala. The first event took place from 18–20 July 2003; it was small and not widely advertised. Organisers produced a second festival in 2005, and by the third festival in 2006 they had added a yoga class, a drum circle, film screenings, lectures, and a sweat lodge.The 2007 festival was renamed Yaga Gathering. Yaga Gathering returned in 2009, and again in 2011 through 2017. There was no Yaga Festival in 2008 or 2010. Yaga Gathering 2017 took place on 3–7 August 2017; the 13th festival, Yaga Gathering 2018, is planned for 9–13 August 2018.In Vedic tradition, a yaga (Sanskrit: याग, romanized: yajna, lit. 'sacrifice') is a ritual performed in front of a sacred fire, or one in which an offering is burned in a fire. The festival's name alludes to spiritual rebirth.

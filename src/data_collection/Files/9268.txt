Aspects: {'N56'}

== Career and sinking ==
Union spent much of her short career operating in the Mediterranean, where she sank the Italian merchant Pietro Querini.  Her success was short-lived however.  Union sailed from Malta at 1 o’clock on the morning of 14 July 1941 with orders to intercept a convoy north of Tripoli the following day.  On 20 July 1941 she was depth charged and sunk with all hands during an attack on the convoy by the Italian torpedo boat Circe south of Pantelleria. When Union failed to return to Malta she was reported overdue on 22 July 1941.

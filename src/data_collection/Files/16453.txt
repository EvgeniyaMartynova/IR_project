Title: YAI: Seeing Beyond Disability
Aspects: {'YAI'}

YAI, previously known as Young Adult Institute, is an organization serving people with Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in New York City. YAI launched as a pilot program at a small school in Brooklyn, New York, in February 1957. The pilot program was run by co-founders Bert MacLeech and Pearl Maze and served seven people with I/DD. Today, YAI has expanded to a team of over 4,000 employees and supports over 20,000 people in the I/DD community. YAI supports people with Autism, Down syndrome, and Cerebral palsy, among others. Operating throughout Downstate New York and Northern New Jersey, YAI now offers more than 300 programs for people of all ages. 
In addition to the 300+ programs, YAI runs directly throughout New York City, Long Island, and Hudson Valley.

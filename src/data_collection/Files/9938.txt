Customers included many of the industry's largest integrated shipping companies such as BAX Global, DHL, Emery Worldwide and UPS.In 1997 Omni entered the passenger charter market with McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10s. In 1998, the company sold its Boeing 727F fleet to focus exclusively on its growing passenger business.

With the addition of these aircraft to its fleet, Omni was awarded 180-minute ETOPS approval by the FAA. This was the second time in the history of US aviation that immediate 180-minute ETOPS approval was granted.

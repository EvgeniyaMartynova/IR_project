Title: K38 Water Safety
Aspects: {'K38'}

K38 Water Safety teaches public and federal safety agencies such as lifeguards, military, fire rescue, and law enforcement how to operate personal water craft (PWC), Jet Skis, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Waverunners, Aquatrax, PWC or RWC (Rescue Water Craft).  K38 teaches personal water craft rescue training in swiftwater rescue, big wave surfing, tow-in surfers, law enforcement, lifesavers, and federal agencies such as United States Navy, United States Marines, United States Coast Guard, U.S. Border Patrol BORSTAR units and Pararescue.

K38 was founded by Shawn Alladio. She is a fourth-generation Santa Ana High School Graduate S.A.H.S. Class of 1979.
Ms. Alladio began teaching in 1989 in Southern California. She purchased her first Kawasaki Jet Ski stand-up in 1979 and became an International Jet Sports Boating Association Professional Racer in 1989. The K38 Way of Training has revolutionized lifesaving around the world with the training standards and applications of personal watercraft, with or without the use of a rescue board that is attached to the stern section of the boat to extricate patients or victims in water incidents. K38 Rescue has trained thousands of agencies worldwide. Shawn Alladio has received numerous awards for her educational and lifesaving efforts.

K38 Water Safety's training programs are for lifesaving purposes using personal watercraft as the best method of insertion to help lifesavers save not only their life, but others in the aquatic environment. The K38 training program evolved over 20 years. There are officially 14 International K38 affiliates.Along with a cadre of professional boating safety instructors, K38 Rescue teaches PWC and RWC courses in swiftwater rescue, flood, open water, surf, lake for recreational and occupational lifesavers.  K38 Water Safety has been instrumental in setting the standards for these small boats for lifesaving and rescue use working closely with boating safety associations and government agencies.

Jon Lee Anderson, a writer for the New Yorker Magazine, rode along with Alladio on her Waverunner the week following the flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. He wrote a story called 'Leaving Desire – The Ninth Ward after the Hurricane' in 2005. Shawn and K38 worked in the lower ninth ward.

Rescue Water Craft Background History
The United States paved the way for using personal watercraft for rescues and patrols. In water rescue applications, they are referred to as 'rescue water craft' (RWC). This began in the late 1970s through the efforts of Kawasaki Motors Corporation U.S.A. The origin of water rescue using PWC's is attributed to these founding fathers:  Brad Southworth and Ronny Kling.  Former Vietnam Veterans and racers whom were asked by Chuck Koontz to provide a rescue application using stand up Jet Skis for the United States Jet Ski Association, which later became the International Jet Sports Boating Association. In 1985 Brad and Ronny began using the 'Fun Tech Wedge' on stand ups, a plastic form that fit around the circumference of the craft making it a more stable rescue platform.  From the Fun Tech Wedge, backboards, litters, modified paddle, body boards, and lines taken to victims and survivors were utilized as transport devices. In the late 1980s rescue board designs adapted to the changing hull designs when two to three-seater craft became available. This became common use for extrication of patients.
The first agencies to receive Jet Skis were Long Beach and Huntington Beach City Lifeguard departments in California.  Brad Southworth and Steve Strickland were hired by Kawasaki on a 'Tropical Tan Tour' to go to lifeguard agencies on the East and West coasts for the purpose of using them on their beaches.  Few agencies during this time applied the stands ups to actual rescue safety applications, but the product was given exposure at local beaches to the public.
The pioneering agencies who have the longest standing tradition of PWC in the United States are Kill Devil Hills Lifeguard Beach Service from North Carolina on the Outer Banks and Taft-Nelson-Delake (TND) Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad out of Lincoln City, Oregon, USA. Both began in the late 1970s and have the distinction of the origins of our PWC rescue heritage.  TND incorporated into 'North Lincoln Fire and Rescue' and both agencies are still using Personal Water Craft in 2010 for operations, over 30 years. In the late 1980s the feasibility of using Jet Skis for rescues began to take on interest from lifeguards and law enforcement.  In 1989 Shawn Alladio began teaching under the name 'Watercraft Awareness Safety Program', after a 10-year development of training concepts and to preserve local riding areas in Southern California. Due to the rapid growth of PWC, her professional development was launched as the product sales increased. This program was eventually named K38 Water Safety. In 1990, the Personal Watercraft Industry Association created the 'Wave Rangers' program to expose law enforcement to these boats in the United States, this lasted a few seasons.
In 2008 Shawn Alladio was invited onto the PWCoffshore.com point-to-point personal water craft endurance race team competing on long distance races called offshore powerboat racing under American Power Boat Association sanctioning. Shawn's first buoy race was in 1980, she has celebrated 30 years of PWC competition, focusing on Offshore and Endurance events, training racers and safety teams for these events. Shawn has competed in offshore PWC racing events ranging from 1,6000 miles to 60 miles since 1989. Such as the LB2CAT a long-standing race event from Long Beach, California to Catalina Island, Avalon and back to Long Beach, and the Mark Hahn 300 a 300-mile memorial endurance race.  Personal Water Craft racing incorporates many different disciplines, such as Closed Course, Obstacle, Sprints, Ovals, Offshore, Endurance, Raids, Slalom, Gran Prix, and Enduros.
In 2011, K38 partnered with the Phoenix Patriot Foundation to create the Phoenix 500 Races and the Purple Heart Patriots PWC Challenge which includes Military personnel who have received the Purple Heart in Afghanistan or Iraq.  These Military personnel operate Kawasaki Jet Ski watercraft in offshore and endurance race events.  The PPF directly supports severely wounded veterans enabling them to fully recover, reintegrate and remain engaged in serving America.Shawn Alladio and K38 Water Safety received the 2005 National Water Safety Congress and National Safe Boating Council Nation Awards for reducing/preventing drowning's across the United States.

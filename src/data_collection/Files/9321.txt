Title: Nokia N78
Aspects: {'N78'}

The Nokia N78 is a 3G smartphone made by Nokia. It was first introduced at the Mobile World Congress on 11 February 2008, and was launched on 26 May 2008 for â‚¬350 before taxes and subsidies. It runs on Symbian 9.3 (S60 3rd Edition, FP2) and was marketed as a more cheaper Nseries device inside a compact, light body. The phone is compatible with the N-Gage 2.0 mobile gaming service.
It is the successor of the N73 and its design shares similarities with the N81, N82 and N96. Despite its relatively low price, the Nokia N78 does still pack numerous standard Nseries features such as A-GPS, HSDPA and Wi-Fi. It has a touch-sensitive Navi wheel like on the N81, and was the first Nokia (and among the first overall, along with Sony Ericsson W980) to feature an FM transmitter. Its keypad is hidden in idle mode and lights up when a key is pressed. It did not however become popular like the N73 was. Later in 2008 the Nokia N79 was introduced.
The Nokia N78 was also the first Nokia phone with the new extended guitar-based version of the Nokia Tune.

Title: Zabadak! (song)
Aspects: {'Zabadak'}

"Zabadak!" is the name of a hit song by the British musical group Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich, written by Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley. It was featured on the 1967 Boxing Day episode of Top of the Pops.The song has been covered by several artists, among them The Sorrows on a single produced for the Italian market.The song uses pseudo-African style percussion (created in the studio by the group), and a nonsense lyric in its repetitive chorus, to highlight the meaning of its two verses (sung in English).  This use of an African motif was typical of the group's dabbling with other world styles of music, such as the Latin style of "Save Me" and the Greek style of "Bend It!"

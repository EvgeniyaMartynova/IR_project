== Career ==
Harvey was born in Walthamstow, London. He was initially being considered as a backing singer and dancer for East 17, however during the initial recording session recording staff heard him singing along, and as a result he was made lead singer of the band.
Harvey's vocal style emulated R&B and new jack swing vocalists from the United States. His vocals put him into a position of the band's frontman, or main member, which was shared with the band's creator, songwriter, instrumentalist, rapper and singer Tony Mortimer.
In 1997 Harvey was sacked from the band after making comments in a radio interview that appeared to condone the use of the drug ecstasy, causing an uproar in the press and the matter being raised in Parliament. Mortimer left East 17 several months later. Harvey eventually rejoined the band under the rebranded name of E-17.As E-17, the band had two UK Top 20 singles between 1998 and 1999 with the album Resurrection reaching the UK Top 50.
In 2000, he collaborated with True Steppers with the song "True Step Tonight" featuring Donell Jones that reached no. 26 in the UK.
After E-17, he signed a record deal with Edel Records and had two singles released in 2001, "Straight Up (No Bends)" (#26 UK) and "Loving You (Ole Ole Ole)" (#20 UK).
In 2004, he appeared on the ITV1 programme I'm a Celebrity...Get Me of Here!, but left early after Janet Street-Porter criticised his flatulence. It was also rumoured that his grandmother died when he was travelling to appear on the show.
On 17 March 2007, Harvey performed a song entitled "I Can" for Making Your Mind Up, the UK's national final for the Eurovision Song Contest. The song was written by singer Conner Reeves. Harvey was eliminated after the first round of voting and the eventual winners were Scooch.In 2014, he released a new single, "Invisible".

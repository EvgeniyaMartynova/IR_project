Title: Arbalète (train)
Aspects: {"L'Arbalète"}

The Arbalète (alternatively written L'Arbalète) was an express train that linked Paris-Est in Paris, France, with Zürich HB in Zurich, Switzerland.  Introduced in 1957, it was operated by the SNCF and the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS).
The train was named after the crossbow used by William Tell to hit the apple on his son's head.
Originally, and for 22 years, the Arbalète was a first-class-only Trans Europ Express (TEE).  On 27 May 1979, it became a two-class InterCity (IC) train, and on 31 May 1987, it was included in the then-new EuroCity (EC) network.  It was discontinued in September 1997, replaced by a TGV service that was routed via Pontarlier and Bern instead of Mulhouse and Basel.

Title: British Rail Class D16/1
Aspects: {'D16'}

LMS No. 10000 and 10001 were the first mainline diesel locomotives built in Great Britain. They were built in association with English Electric by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at its Derby Works, using an English Electric 1600 hp diesel engine, generator and electrics.
Under British Railways, the locomotives became British Railways Class D16/1; they were initially operated primarily on mainline express passenger services on former LMS lines, both in single and in multiple. In 1953, they were transferred to the Southern Region for comparison with O. Bulleid's British Rail Class D16/2 diesel locomotives.
Both units were withdrawn and scrapped in the 1960s.


== Background and design ==


=== Background ===
In March 1947, the LMS announced its intention to operate main line passenger services using diesel traction: initial specifications were for a pair of 1600 hp locomotives with a top speed of 100 mph, capable of hauling express services such as the Royal Scot. The company also announced it intended to use the same type singly on semi-fast suburban and medium weight freight services such as were hauled by 2-6-4T engines ; English Electric engines were specified of similar design to that used on the company's diesel electric shunting locomotives. The LMS signed an agreement with the English Electric Company to construct two 1600 hp locomotives: the mechanical parts were to be constructed at the LMS's Derby Works with H.G. Ivatt responsible as the overall designer; electrical parts and diesel engine were to be supplied by English Electric.The bogies took an American pattern design, which was modified by Edward Fox and his team at Derby to create a smooth riding suspension. The welded bogie frame was derived from Fox's earlier design for Liverpool-Southport electric trains (later renumbered British Rail Class 502).


=== Design ===
The primary suspension consisted of equalising beams with coil springs; the equalising beams were located within the bogie 'sandwich type' side frame, whilst the secondary suspension utilised a two bolsters per bogie incorporating four transverse leaf springs. The locomotive weight was carried on four sliding elements on the bolster, with a center pivot used to transfer tractive forces.The locomotive body was a cowl unit design, consisting of structural longitudinal members, with cross stretchers forming the supports for the internal equipment including the engine-generator. The locomotive superstructure was mechanically separated from the load bearing structures by pivots at either end of the body and incorporated roof doors for access to the diesel engine. The driving cabs incorporating nose sections were also separate structures; each cab was accessible from the other via an inner walkway, and passage between locomotives was enabled by end corridor connections. Each cab 'nose' contained a traction motor cooling fan, and an air compressor.The external design was a streamlined, art-deco style twin cab design in a black & chromatic silver livery. English Electric supplied engine from its Rugby factory, the DC Generator from their Bradford works, and Traction Motors from the Dick,Kerr Works in Preston.  Vacuum brakes were from Westinghouse, and the oil-fired train heat boiler was from Clarkson.The engine, and main and auxiliary generators formed a single unit which was mounted on anti-vibration mounts. For use in the locomotive the engine was rated at 1600 hp at 750rpm; the engine was water cooled. Water, lubricating oil and fuel pumps were driven from one end of the engine's crankshaft. Two Serck radiators were used for cooling, each with water and oil cooling elements.The main generator was a 1080 kW 650 V 1660 A continuous rated self ventilated machine directly connected to the engines crankshaft and supported by an extension of the diesel engines bedplate. The generator used two separately excited field windings whilst generating, using a series winding for battery powered (60 cell, 236 Ahr, D.P. Kathanode) motor starting. An auxiliary generator end connected to the main generator rated at 50 kW, 135V 375A supplied control equipment, compressors, motor cooling blowers, lighting, as well as providing the excitation for the main generator. Both generators projected from the engine room into a separate dust filtered control equipment cubicle.Each axle was powered: the traction motors were axle hung, nose suspended, driving the wheelsets via a single reduction gear. The motors were connected in three parallel connected groups of sets of two motors connected in series; each motor was a series wound machine rated at 220 HP, 300 V, 550 A.Locomotive power control could be varied through 8 notches, obtained via three engine speeds used (450, 620, 750 rpm) with additional control obtained by varying the main generator excitation.

=== Introduction ===
LMS 10000 was officially presented to the Press at Derby Works in December 1947, and the locomotive was also presented at Euston station on 18 December 1947, making a demonstration return journey to Watford.10000 was outshopped only three weeks before nationalisation, and when 10001 appeared in July 1948, it had British Railways livery. Ivatt 'filed' all correspondence from British Railways instructing the removal of the LMS letters, which were only finally removed upon his retirement, in 1951.On 14 and 15 January 1948, No. 10000 underwent tests on the line between St. Pancras and Manchester, the schedule being set to timings based on a standard 4-6-0 (5X) passenger express locomotive. The attached load was a 393-ton tare, 12 carriage train including a dynamometer car; No. 10000 performed the services within the accepted schedule.


=== Operations ===
After initial tests, from February 1948, locomotive No. 10000 was placed on a twice-daily London-Derby (128.5 mile) return passenger service, hauling trains of 300 to 450 gross tons. No. 10001 also began service on the London-Derby route when completed, with a Derby-Manchester service also begun.

In late 1948, both units were withdrawn for modifications based on service experience. They then returned to their midland service, before being transferred to operate express Euston-Carlisle-Glasgow passenger trains. The locomotives were operated in multiple: on 1 June 1949, they operated the 16 carriage "Royal Scot" express of 545 gross tons non-stop from Euston to Glasgow, making a return run on 2 June. At the gradients leading to Shap and Beattock, the engines operated at full power, hauling the trains at 38 and 36 mph in each case. After June 1949, the units operated for over 2 months in multiple formation - working London-Carlisle and later London-Glasgow services.In multiple, the locomotives showed potential for high speed services, on one occasion operating a standard Euston-Carlisle train at an average speed of just over 60 mph, including delays; this was 74 minutes quicker than usually scheduled.From mid 1949, the locomotives began operating singly, with No.10000 worked Euston-Blackpool services, and No.10001 was trialled operating London-Glasgow services. Other services operated included London to Crewe and to Liverpool. On the "Red Rose" express, No. 10001 recorded 82 mph on a down gradient with a gross train load of 490tons.The units were also used on freight services, including express London (Camden) to Crewe, and Crewe-Willesden; the locomotives met the scheduled average speed of 45 mph on the Camden-Crewe trains with a 500-ton train. One notable freight working was the haulage of a 60 wagon, 1100 ton gross coal train, between Rugby and Willesden, achieving 25 mph on a 1 in 133 gradient to Tring Summit.Other operations included a trial on the Settle and Carlisle, and workings to Perth, and, on one occasion, to Aberdeen. Due to boiler problems sometimes leaving them unable to provide carriage heating, they often worked freights in winter and the Royal Scot in summer.In March 1953, they were both transferred to the Southern Region of British Railways to allow direct comparison to be made between them and the SR's 10201, 10202 & 10203 and remained there until spring 1955, notably working the Bournemouth Belle and occasionally through to Exeter, but also visiting Brighton Works. At a low point of their career in terms of reliability, they (and the SR locomotives) were sent to Derby where they were overhauled and received green livery and then ran side by side on London Midland Region duties, including the Royal Scot again in 1957–58.


=== Classification ===
At a meeting between the LMS and English Electric on 20 May 1946, it was agreed that a single locomotive would be equivalent to a Class 5 mixed traffic engine, and that two coupled together would be capable of handling the same loads as a Class 7 locomotive.The original power classification was 5P/5F. Upon transfer to the Southern Region (SR) in 1953, they were given the classification 6P/5F, but no. 10000 was later marked 6P/5FA. At this time, SR practice was to show the loading classification on locomotives, whereas other regions applied the statistical classification. They reverted to 5P/5F at some point after their return to the London Midland Region in 1955; only no. 10000 was marked 5P/5F; no. 10001 was marked 5P/5FA. Their final power classification, allotted in 1957, was simply 5.In 1957, the two locomotives were placed in the Type 3 power group. The classification system introduced in February 1960 for internal use by the Eastern and North Eastern Regions gave these locomotives the code D16/1; in 1962, this was amended to 16/8. Eventually, they were placed in BR Class 34.


=== Withdrawal ===
Both locos were lastly allocated to Willesden. The locomotives were laid up at Derby in 1963 with Bulleid's diesels; No. 10001 was made functional using parts of both, and continued operating until 1966, fitted with a yellow warning panel. No. 10000 was withdrawn in 1963 and scrapped at Cashmores, Great Bridge, in January 1968; between withdrawal and scrapping, 10000 spent some time in storage at Derby, and was one of the locos on display at the Derby Works Open Day and Flower Show in August 1964.No. 10001's later workings were said to be mainly on North London freights to Greenwich, but was also photographed on Wolverhampton expresses and WCML freights during this period. Together, the two units clocked more than 2 million miles. 10001 was withdrawn in 1966 and scrapped at Cox & Danks, North Acton, also in January 1968.


== Legacy ==

The bogie design was used practically unchanged on the EM2 electric locomotives (Class 77). The bogie design incorporating equalising beam suspension influenced a large number of subsequent British diesel locomotives designs.Both locos were subject to preservation attempts from railwaymen who appreciated the change and improvements gained by the switch to diesels. 10000 was offered to Clapham Railway Museum, but was refused on grounds of space and not representing a class. No. 10001 was hidden at the back of Willesden Depot, having been 'overlooked' for removal at least twice.


=== Replica ===
In 2011, the Ivatt Diesel Recreation Society announced plans to build a replica of LMS 10000, using contemporary parts as well as new build components. The Society has achieved charitable status (Reg Charity No.1147032).  Their Honorary President is Mr Stanley Fletcher, a retired English Electric engineer. As of 2012, the Society has sourced an early EE 16SVT diesel engine dating to the 1940s and a Class 58 diesel which will form the frame for the new loco.In 2018 the society purchased the spare pair of EM2 bogies from the EM2 society. These will be refurbished and placed under the class 58 chassis frame

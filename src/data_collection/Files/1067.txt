Brighton and Hove () is a seaside city in East Sussex, in South East England. The towns of Brighton and Hove formed a unitary authority in 1997 and in 2001 were granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II. "Brighton" is often referred to synonymously with the official "Brighton and Hove" although many locals still consider the two to be different towns.  At the 2011 census, the city was England's most populous seaside resort, as well as the largest city in South East England, with a population of 273,400.


== History ==

Brighton and Hove is the result of a number of historic local government reorganisations:

Brighton was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1854, later becoming a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888; it covered the parish of Brighton and part of Preston;
Hove became a local board of health in the late 19th century, originally covering the parish of Hove;
In 1893 the parish of Aldrington was added to Hove local board;
Hove became incorporated as a municipal borough in 1898;
Hangleton, Preston Rural and West Blatchington were added to Hove in 1928;
Ovingdean, Patcham and Rottingdean were added to Brighton in 1928;
Portslade-by-Sea was added to Hove in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. Both Brighton and Hove became non-metropolitan districts of East Sussex.
On 15 October 2004, Brighton and Hove was granted Fairtrade City status.


== City Council ==


=== Political composition ===

Elections are held every four years. Therefore, the last elections occurring on 2 May 2019
Brighton and Hove was the first ever council in the United Kingdom where the Green Party were both the largest group and led the council (from May 2011 to May 2015).
In February 2019 long-standing Labour councillor Anne Meadows defected to the Conservatives. She was deselected as a candidate for the 2019 elections by the Moulsecoomb and Bevendean ward Labour Party in 2018.
Former Labour group leader Councillor Warren Morgan left the Labour Party in February 2019. He affiliated with The Independent Group (TIG) along with fellow former Labour councillor Michael Inkpen-Leissner.
This change in political structure saw the Conservatives become the largest party on the council, as one former Labour seat was vacant following a councillor’s resignation within six months of elections.
In March 2019, an extraordinary council meeting was called by the Conservatives in a bid to take control of the authority in the final weeks before the May 2019 elections. This move was defeated as Green and TIG councillors voted with Labour.


=== Industrial relations ===
In 2013 the council was obliged to finalise single status across its workforce, resulting in a strike of its refuse collectors and street cleaners. Their council reformed their allowances to equalise them with other staff at the organisation conducting similar work.


=== Administration ===
The Leader of the Council and Labour minority administration since April 2018 is Councillor Daniel Yates (Lab Co-op).
The mayor of Brighton and Hove for 2019–2020 is Councillor Alex Phillips  Geoff Raw is the current chief executive.


=== DVLA database ban ===
In 2012 it was revealed that the Brighton and Hove unitary authority has been permanently banned from accessing information from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. This information is normally made available to local authorities for purposes such as enforcing parking fines, but access can be withdrawn if they are found to be misusing the service. The Big Brother Watch organisation, which obtained the information about the ban under a Freedom of Information request, claimed that "the public are right to be worried that their privacy is at risk across a range of government services."

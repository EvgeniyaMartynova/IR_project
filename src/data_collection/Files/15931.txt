Xavier University School of Medicine is a not-for-profit medical school located in Oranjestad, Aruba.


== About ==
Xavier University School of Medicine (XUSOM) was founded in 2004 and is chartered by the government of Aruba with authorization by the Ministry of Education of Aruba to confer the Doctor of Medicine degree. The school is located in Oranjestad, the capital and largest city in Aruba.
The campus has a facility with over 125,000 square feet of space. Each classroom has central air conditioning and is equipped with wireless technology, state-of –the-art smartboards, and anatomy labs. Additional premedical campuses are located in Jordan, Jenin, India, and Ghana.


== Curriculum ==
Xavier offers two programs; the Pre-med Program and the MD program.
The Pre-med program is a five-and-a-half-year program that is for students coming in from high school or for students who have not completed all of their pre-requisites. The first year and half of the course involves taking pre-med courses at our Aruba campus.  After the completion of the year and half, the student can transition into the MD program. 
The MD program at XUSOM is delivered over four calendar years. During the first two years, the program covers the basic sciences. Students study at the university’s campus in Aruba. During the last two years, which cover the clinical sciences, students move on to clinical clerkships at the university’s affiliated hospitals in the United States.
The first two years concentrate on the traditional (integrated) basic sciences discipline. Laboratory experiences are an integral part of these first two years, along with small group discussions designed for systems-based learning and early integration of basic sciences into the clinical experience. The basic science courses use didactic lectures, laboratory instruction, supplemental instruction, case-based learning, question-based reviews, small-group tutorials, and computer-assisted instruction. The school offers the NBME CBSE exam and Kaplan Review course for the USMLE Step1. Xavier has a 94% first-time pass USMLE pass rate.
The total curriculum for clinical rotations is 72 weeks, including 48 weeks of core rotations, 24 weeks of elective rotations, and 12 weeks of hospital rotations (sub internships).  The Clinical rotations are done in the United States.

Title: Ka'apor language
Aspects: {"Ka'apor (disambiguation)"}

Kaapor (Ka’apor, Kaaporté), also known as "Urubú," "Caapor" or Urubú-Kaapor, is a Tupi–Guarani language spoken as a primary language only by the Ka'apor people of French Guiana and Brazil. The language is spoken as a second language by member non-Ka'apor ethnic groups, including Tembé. The language is historically most closely related to the Wayãpi language, however the two languages are currently mutually unintelligible.
There is a high incidence of congenital deafness among the Kaapor people, most of whom grow up bilingual in Urubu-Kaapor Sign Language, which may be indigenous to them.

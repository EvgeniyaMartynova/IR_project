Title: Malaysian Qualifications Framework
Aspects: {'QAD'}

The Malaysian Qualifications Framework (Malay: Kerangka Kelayakan Malaysia) or the MQF is a unified system of post secondary qualifications offered on a national basis in Malaysia. It is administered by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA), a statutory body under the purview of the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE).


== Development of the MQF ==
With the rapid growth of the private education sector in Malaysia, the National Accreditation Board (Malay: Lembaga Akreditasi Negara) or LAN was established in 1996 to oversee the certification of standards and accreditation of academic programs provided by private colleges and universities in Malaysia. In April 2002, a Quality Assurance Division (QAD) was established by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to manage and co-ordinate the quality assurance system in public universities.Prior to the establishment of these bodies, no specific accreditation system existed and institutions of higher education had only to be duly established or registered under the relevant governing legislations:

Public institutions of higher learningUniversities and University Colleges Act 1971[1]Private institutions of higher learningEssential (Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations 1969 (repealed in 1996)
Education Act 1996[2]
Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996[3]In June 2003, a national consultation seminar was held to establish a national qualifications framework that would integrate, rationalise, justify and bring together all qualifications offered on a national basis into a single interconnected system. The MQF was finally adopted in 2007 and both the QAD and LAN were dissolved and their functions taken over by the MQA which was established on 1 November 2007 by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency Act 2007.


== Qualification awarding sectors ==

Title: Sony Vaio Y series
Aspects: {'Y series'}

The Vaio Y series is a line of notebook computer from Sony introduced in January 2010. It is a netbook-inspired model designed for travel use: compared with the other 13.3" models in the Vaio range, the Y lacks an optical drive, and is heavier and cheaper than the premium Sony Vaio Z series, but lighter than the consumer-grade Sony Vaio S series, with better battery life than either, thanks to the use of CULV processors. The weight is 3.92lbs (1.78kg).
The Y series features a 13.3" 16:9 1366x768 screen, 2-8GB of DDR3 RAM, hard drive or SSD, CULV Intel dual-core CPU, Mobile Intel Intel GMA 4500MHD or ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4550 graphics (refreshed models only), integrated VGA webcam, gigabit ethernet, 802.11b/g/n wireless,  and Windows 7 64 bit. Initially the Y series shipped with a Core 2 CULV CPUs; the mid-2010 refresh saw these replaced with newer Arrandale CULV chips.
Battery specs are 5000 mAh (330g - standard) or 7500 mAh (490g - extended).

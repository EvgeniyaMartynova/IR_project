== FCC violation ==
On March 21, 2003, from 8:10 a.m. to 8:15 a.m., former morning show hosts Cosmo & JC aired a prank phone call between the radio station and Life Crisis Services, a gambling addiction hot line. The FCC complaint stated that the radio station personality pretended to have a legitimate gambling problem. Once the representative from Life Crisis realized it was a prank phone call, she hung up.
The station did not inform the hot line the call was for broadcast, which is a violation of Federal Communication Commission (FCC) law Section 73.1206. On April 4, 2003, Mid-Missouri Broadcasting made an official on-air apology to Life Crisis and provided a link on its website for its services, but even so, on November 23, 2004, the FCC fined Mid-Missouri Broadcasting $4000.
Mid-Missouri Broadcasting later sold the station along with others to Cumulus Media.

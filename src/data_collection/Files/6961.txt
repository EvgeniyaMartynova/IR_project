== History ==
In August 1928 a property in Vandalia, Ohio was called the "Dayton Airport".
On December 17, 1936 the airport opened as the "Dayton Municipal Airport" with three 3,600-foot (1,100 m) concrete runways and connecting taxiways.
In 1952 the city named the airport "James M. Cox-Dayton Municipal Airport" in honor of the former Governor of Ohio and Democratic candidate for President of the United States. A ground breaking ceremony was held in 1959 for a new $5.5 million terminal designed by Yount, Sullivan and Lecklider, completed in 1961. The airport's name became "James M. Cox Dayton International Airport" in 1975.
The April 1957 OAG shows 73 weekday departures: 56 TWA, 13 American and 4 Lake Central. TWA had two nonstops to New York but no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago-Detroit-Cleveland-Pittsburgh-Cincinnati. The first jets were TWA Convair 880s from Chicago in January 1961.
The airport was a hub for Piedmont Airlines from July 1, 1982 until its merger with US Airways, which continued the Dayton hub for a year or two. In March 1988 Piedmont had nonstops from Dayton to 27 airports, California to Boston to Florida, plus eight more on its prop affiliate. USAir and successor US Airways kept Dayton as a focus-city. The airport was a hub for Emery Worldwide, a freight carrier.
In 1981 Emery Worldwide completed an air freight hub sortation facility next to Runway 6L–24R. Emery added to the facility until the early 1990s, making it one of the world's largest air freight facilities at the time.
A $50 million renovation of the airport's terminal building, designed by Levin Porter Associates, was completed in 1989. A new 2-lane access road was built.In 1998 the airport started renovating the terminal building. The $25 million project was completed in 2002. The renovations included energy efficient climate control systems, lighting, windows and entry/exit doorways, a new paging system, and ceiling tiles and carpeting. The news, gift shops, and food and beverage concessionaires improved their leased areas in the terminal building.On May 1, 2011 Air Canada Express ended flights to Toronto Pearson, the airport's only international destination, when the airline consolidated its service at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Dayton now has no scheduled international flights.
On August 12, 2012 Southwest Airlines began serving Dayton with flights to Denver International Airport. This was expected to increase passenger traffic by at least 15 percent.In 2013 Concourse D, built in 1978 and used by Piedmont Airlines and US Airways for their mini-hub operation until its closure in 1991, was demolished.  Concourse C was renamed Concourse A.In 2015 Southwest Airlines announced a reduction in flights from Dayton: nonstop flights to Baltimore, Denver, Orlando and Tampa all ended April 11, 2016. This left one nonstop destination from Dayton via Southwest. Passenger traffic is down nearly 9% since 2014, along with aircraft departures down 8%. Fares from Dayton have continued to rise while neighboring airports are lowering fares with new low-cost carriers. Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport has drastically reduced fares since 2014 while also experiencing over 10% growth in passengers.On November 19, 2015 Dayton officials announced that Allegiant Air would add service in April twice a week to Orlando and Tampa. Allegiant Air would become the only low-cost fare carrier at the airport and would fill the gap left by Southwest Airlines' reduction in flights to Florida.
On January 4, 2017 Southwest announced that it would end its flights to Chicago Midway and move services to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, adding eight daily flights there to and from Chicago Midway and Baltimore–Washington International Airport. Southwest's last day in Dayton was June 3, 2017.Today the airport covers  4,200 acres (17 km2), and has 5.0 miles (8.0 km) of runway. It is served by six passenger airlines and has sixteen non-stop destinations. The airport has an estimated $1 billion economic impact on the Dayton area economy.


== Construction projects ==

In 2011, Dayton International Airport completed a new air traffic control tower. The tower is about 254 feet (77 m) high with a 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m2) base building of office and operational space for FAA personnel. The switchover to the new tower was at midnight on June 4, 2011. Construction cost $21 million (the tower project's total cost was $30.6 million including equipment) and will eventually reduce the current staff of 38 controllers in Dayton to 12.The airport broke ground in April 2009 for a new multi-level parking garage, which opened in the summer of 2010.A parking lot improvement project began in October 2008 and provided for: (1) the construction of a new entrance/exit for a new "red" long term parking lot and economy parking lot; (2) reconfiguration and restriping of the existing credit card parking lot; (3) installation of revenue control equipment for the overflow parking lot; (4) upgrade of electrical and lighting within various parking lots. These improvements are to be completed in May 2009. The access road to the terminal has been undergoing several upgrades since October 2007 which involves the rehabilitation of Terminal Drive pavement, drainage system upgrades, installation of underground utilities and erection of new signage and other related roadway improvements.The airport began a multi-year project in October 2006 to the perimeter roadway network to provide access around the airfield and to enhance safety by eliminating vehicle crossing of runways and taxiways. The project was completed in November 2009.In June 2009, the airport completed a project to enhance safety by improving the 6R/24L runway safety area. Runway 6R pavement was extended by 285 feet (87 m) to connect to the taxiway pavement. In addition, a high pressure gas transmission main and an 8-inch (200 mm) service main were relocated from under the footprint of the runway extension. The installation of wildlife fencing, completed in May 2009, enhances airport safety by reducing the movement of wild animals on the airfield.In January 2018 the airport began another expansion focusing on the end of the airport with the ticketing counters and the parking garage. This work is due to finish in August 2018.

== In popular film ==
In the 2008 film Eagle Eye, the two main characters are told to take a bus to the Dayton International Airport. The airport's name was mentioned several other times in the movie, even though there are no actual screen shots at the Dayton International Airport in the making of the movie. The actual airport scenes were shot at the Los Angeles International Airport.


== Accidents ==
On March 9, 1967, TWA Flight 553, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 jet airliner operated by Trans World Airlines, en route to Dayton when it collided with a Beechcraft Baron over Urbana, Ohio. Visual flight rules (VFR) were in effect at the time of the accident. However, the uncontrolled VFR traffic around Dayton airspace contributed to, also with high rate of descent of the DC-9 prompted, Federal Aviation Administration's decision to create Terminal Control Areas or TCAs (either called Class B airspace and Class C airspace) coordination. All 25 passengers and crew of the DC-9 and the sole occupant of the Beechcraft were killed.
On January 12, 1989, a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 operated by Bradley Air Services, bound for Montréal-Dorval International Airport, crashed approximately 1.2 mi (2 km) north of the airport after colliding with trees due to improper instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures by the first officer. Both occupants perished.On July 28, 2007 an aircraft performing a loop over the airport at the Vectren Dayton Air Show slammed into the runway when attempting to finish the maneuver. The pilot, Jim LeRoy, was killed in the crash.On June 22, 2013, a stunt plane carrying wing walker Jane Wicker crashed at the air show, killing both Wicker and pilot Charlie Schwenker.On May 29, 2014, a Cessna 201 with 1 crew on-board landed with the landing gear not lowered. The pilot was not hurt. It was ruled to be caused by "pilot error".
On June 23, 2017, the day before the air show, a United States Air Force Thunderbirds F-16D jet, not scheduled to perform, was taxiing to a staging area after a familiarization flight, when witnesses reported a gust of wind flipped the aircraft onto its top in a grassy area next to the taxiway. Both the pilot and a team crew member were trapped in the airplane for two hours; the pilot suffered only minor injuries while the crew member had no visible injuries. The Thunderbirds canceled their scheduled performances for both days of the air show.

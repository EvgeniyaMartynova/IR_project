Title: E18 Album
Aspects: {'E18'}

E18 Album is the debut album by the band Detektivbyrån released by the Japanese label P-Vine under license from the band's own label Danarkia. It may also be viewed as a compilation album as it mainly contains all the songs from the EP Hemvägen and the single "Lyckans Undulat". Also included on the album is the song "Laka-Koffa", previously released in May 2007 on a limited 500 copies 7" vinyl single "Detektivbyrån - Hemstad" accompanied by the song "Tuff Ungdom" by Hemstad. The song "Home Sweet Home", which is a variant of "Hem Ljuva Hem", was previously unreleased.
The album name E18 Album is a likely homage to the European route E18 that passes through the city of Karlstad, Värmland where the band members grew up.

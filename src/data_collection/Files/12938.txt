== Facility and history ==

Shorewood High School's original facility, built in 1975, spanned 5 city blocks. It had eight single floor buildings with open outdoor corridors.  The 1975 building was built in sections:  the 100s building, closest to N. 175th Street was originally the Ronald Grade School built in 1906 and closed in 1971 due to a failed levy.  The building was then used as a museum until 2010.
Along with the elementary school being closed, five other schools were closed, including Butler Junior High School, an older school originally built in 1953 and closed in 1973 to be rebuilt and become the main campus for the new High School named Shorewood.  The students still in 7th or 8th grade at the time of the closure were sent to either Einstein Junior High School, or Cordell Hull Junior High School, with a few going to Kellogg Junior High School. None of these schools was a "middle" school at that time.  Shorewood was to be the first 4-year high school.  Upon its opening, only the 9th and 10th graders were brought in.  That 10th grade class remained the eldest class at Shorewood until their graduation in the summer of 1978. It was a unique situation for that one class of students as they never had to face upperclassmen. During this transition period for the district, all of the remaining junior high schools became middle schools.  Many of the last class of 7th grade students to enter Butler Junior High School were in the very first graduating class of Shorewood High School in 1978.
Shorewood High School underwent a 6.5 million dollar renovation in 1997.In 2011 the school district approved plans to replace the school building with a new facility on the same site.  The renovation and incorporation of the historic Ronald School building was approved by the Association of King County Historical Organizations.  The ground-breaking ceremony for the new construction was held on October 17, 2011.  The historic building was incorporated into the design as part of the new school's performing arts department and the remainder of the existing buildings were demolished.  Architects for the new school were Bassetti Architects.  The new 220,000 square foot facility opened on time in September 2013 for the 2013-14 school year.

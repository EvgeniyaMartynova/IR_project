Aspects: {'N. montana'}

Neriene montana (aka Linyphia montana) is a species of spider belonging to the family Linyphiidae. With a holarctic distribution, it is found throughout northern Europe.The body length excluding legs is about 4 to 7 mm in both sexes, males having a slimmer abdomen. The carapace is dark brown with a darker midline and margins. The abdomen is marked with a broad brown folium with pale speckles and small indentations, surrounded by a pale area. The legs are yellow-brown with many annulations which, along with its size, help to distinguish N. montana from similar species. It builds a hammock-shaped web among bushes or low vegetation, on tree trunks, or under logs, which it rests beneath.

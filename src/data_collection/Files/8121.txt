Title: Leather & Grace
Aspects: {'L&G (disambiguation)'}

Leather & Grace (L&G) is an organization of Unitarian Universalists who identify with or support the BDSM/kink community. Founded in 2011, L&G is a member of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, and engages in educational and advocacy work for "kink-oriented" UUs within the denomination. The organization's efforts are coordinated by an elected steering committee, which appoints and oversees specialized committees (educational outreach, crisis response, etc.) and local affiliates. The current Moderator is Desmond Ravenstone, a lay leader at the Arlington Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts.
Their logo combines a red flaming chalice with the stripes of the Leather Pride flag.

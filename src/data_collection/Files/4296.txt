Title: Acrocomia crispa
Aspects: {'G. crispa'}

Acrocomia crispa, the Cuban belly palm or Corojo palm, a palm species which is endemic to Cuba.  Formerly placed in its own genus, Gastrococos, recent work found that that genus was nested within Acrocomia.   It is a tall, spiny palm with a trunk that is slender at the base, but swollen in the middle, giving it the name "Cuban belly palm" in English.

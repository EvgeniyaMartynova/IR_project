Title: I Love the '90s (British TV series)
Aspects: {"I Love the '90s"}

I Love the '90s is a BBC television mini-series that examines the pop culture of the 1990s. It was commissioned following the success of I Love the '70s and I Love the '80s, with episodes being 60 minutes long, except for 1990 which was 90 minutes long. In 2019, the series was repeated as a weekly show lasting 30 minutes per year, with I Love 1993 following on from the I Love 1987 episode in BBC Two's Monday night listings.


== Background ==
There were ten episodes, with one devoted to each year from 1990 to 1999.  Each episode recalled major events (such as the 1991 Gulf War and 1997 death of Diana, Princess of Wales) from the given year, along with popular or memorable films, television series, music, video games and fashion trends, as well as short-lived fads, and was hosted by a celebrity (or celebrities, or in one stance cartoon characters) connected with one of the items from that year.
The final episode, I Love '99, ended with the Baz Luhrmann produced hit single of the year, Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen), whilst a montage of all of the BBC "I Love..." episodes, from 1970 to 1999 was shown.

Title: Yahballaha V
Aspects: {'Yahballaha'}

Mar Yahballaha V was the third Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church, from 1578 to 1580.
According to Tfinkdji, he was ordained bishop of Gazireh in 1556 by Patriarch Abdisho IV Maron.
Tisserant says that problems posed by the traditionalist "Nestorians" and the Turkish authorities prevented until 1578 the election of a successor to Abdisho IV (1555−1570). Already old at the time of his election, Yahballaha V died in 1580 without having been able to seek confirmation from Rome.
Heleen Murre-Van den Berg argues that Yahballaha was elected in 1577 and died in 1579.
Both she and David Wilmshurst hold that, after the death of Abdisho IV, this Yahballaha, not yet formally elected as Patriarch, or another of the same name acted as patriarch or at least as administrator of the patriarchate.

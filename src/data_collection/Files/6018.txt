== Release ==
"I Got You" is the first track on Badfinger's 1981 album, Say No More. That same year, the song was released as the follow-up single to the band's previous Say No More single, "Hold On," backed with Tom Evans's "Rock 'N' Roll Contract", However, unlike its predecessor—which had reached #56 in America—it failed to chart. A follow-up to "I Got You" ("Because I Love You") was released, but it was unsuccessful. After these singles, the band split into two separate bands under the Badfinger name until bassist Tom Evans committed suicide in 1983.

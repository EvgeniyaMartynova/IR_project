== Music style and influences ==
Many media outlets compare the band to Queen and Meat Loaf because of its use of theatrics and over-the-top lyrics. Andrew Winney stated, "If Noel Fielding and Freddie Mercury had a love child it would be Foxy Shazam vocalist Eric Sean Nally." The magazine Alternative Press compared the band to bands like Queen, My Chemical Romance, and The Darkness, while also believing that the band has a unique sound that should best be seen live.


== Origin of their name ==
The band name was claimed to have originated from a slang phrase used by students at vocalist Eric Sean Nally's high school. "Foxy shazams" meant 'cool shoes'. (e.g. "Damn, those are some foxy shazams!"). In a Rockline radio interview in March 2012, Nally stated that this was not the case by saying that the truth is not as interesting as real life. He had been lying about it for 5 years and it just stuck. This was later confirmed by Alex Nauth and Aaron McVeigh in an interview with Norse Media in July 2012.

Title: Zbrojovka Z 6 Hurvínek
Aspects: {'Z6'}

The Zbrojovka Z 6 Hurvínek was a car produced by Československá Zbrojovka in the 1930s.


== Design ==
Designed as a smaller complement to the Zbrojovka Z 4, the Z 6 Hurvínek was a two-door sedan powered by a liquid cooled two cylinder two stroke engine. The production car used a two stroke two cylinder 735 cc (44.9 in3) engine with a bore of 90 mm (3 1⁄2 in) and stroke of 77 mm (3 in).


== Performance ==
The Z 5 Express could reach a top speed of 90 km/h (56 mph) and had a typical fuel consumption of between 8 l/100 km (35 mpg‑imp; 29 mpg‑US), which meant that the 20 l (4.4 imp gal; 5.3 US gal) fuel tank was sufficient to drive from Prague to Brno.


== Production ==
The car was announced in October 1935 at the Prague Motor Show and sales continued after the factory moved to military production from 1936, the last car being sold in 1938. 480 examples were sold at a price of 19,800 Kčs.

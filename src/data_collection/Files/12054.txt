Title: Chlorofluoromethane
Aspects: {'R31'}

Chlorofluoromethane or Freon 31 is the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) with the formula CH2ClF. It is a colorless, odorless, flammable gas.


== Uses ==
Pyrolysis of a mixture of dichlorofluoromethane and chlorofluoromethane gives hexafluorobenzene:
3 CHCl2F  +  3 CH2ClF →   C6F6  +  9 HClIt was used as a refrigerant and has an ozone depletion potential of 0.02.


== Additional data ==
Its crystal structure is monoclinic with space group P21 and lattice constants a = 6.7676, b = 4.1477, c = 5.0206 (.10−1 nm), β = 108.205°.At an altitude of 22 km, traces of chlorofluoromethane occur (148 ppt).

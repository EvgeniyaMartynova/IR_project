Eagle's Nest operates a small flight school which currently offers flight instruction towards the private, instrument, and commercial ratings.  The primary flight instructor is Caleb Waite, who holds a Bachelor of Science Degree from LeTourneau University in Aeronautical Science. He is qualified as a single-engine, multi-engine, and instrument instructor, and also works part-time as an aircraft mechanic in Eagle's Nests maintenance facility.  Marianne Blair also is an instrument instructor at Eagle's Nest. Two Cessna 172M aircraft are available for rent: N19868 and N1766V.  N1766V is a former police airplane, and N19868 was acquired in 2007 from a private owner.  The rental rate as of January 2016 is $125.00/hour, or $115.00/hr if prepaid in a 10-hour block.  The flight school and FBO was home to a mascot of sorts, a dog named Lexie until June 2013.

Aerial tours of the Charlottesville/Waynesboro/Shenandoah Valley area are available for $65.00 for a 1/2 hour in the FBO's C-182RG, often piloted by John Trissel.

Title: Westinghouse J30
Aspects: {'J30'}

The Westinghouse J30, initially known as the Westinghouse 19XB, was a turbojet engine developed by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. It was the first American-designed turbojet to run, and only the second axial-flow turbojet to run outside Germany (after the British Metropolitan-Vickers F.2).A simple and robust unit with six-stage compressor, annular combustor, and single-stage turbine, it initially gave 1,200 pounds of thrust but improved to 1,600 in production versions. Its first flight was under a FG Corsair in January 1944. It was developed into the smaller J32, and the successful Westinghouse J34, an enlarged version which produced 3,000 pounds of thrust.

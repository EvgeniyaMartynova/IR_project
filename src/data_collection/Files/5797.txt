Title: Down by the Jetty
Aspects: {"I Don't Mind"}

Down by the Jetty is the debut album by Dr. Feelgood, released in January 1975.
The band's Johnny Kidd & The Pirates influenced originals ("Keep It Out of Sight") appear alongside covers material like "Bonie Maronie" and "Tequila".The album was a primary influence on The Strypes, covering "I'm A Hog For You Baby" on their 2013 debut album Snapshot. Paul Weller and Bob Geldof have also acknowledged the influence of the album, as have Blondie, The Ramones and  Richard Hell, who were introduced to the album by Blondie's drummer, Clem Burke.In 1976, prior to being signed, The Jam demoed a cover of "Cheque Book".  Paul Weller's copy of the album is also glimpsed on the sleeve of The Style Council's 1985 LP, Our Favourite Shop.

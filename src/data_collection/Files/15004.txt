== Release ==
Sony Ericsson W200 was announced in the second quarter of 2007. It was released in three variants: W200a (for the Americas), W200c (for China) and W200i (rest of the world). All the three variants had minor differences, like the languages available in the phone. Sony Ericsson launched W200i as the budget Walkman phone. It retailed at about USD 150 at its launch in the US. In UK it was initially available for 200 pounds and subsequently its price dropped to a 100 pounds.


== Reception ==
W200 is mainly aimed for the youth who are looking for a reasonable yet a good quality music phone. W200 provides all the major music player features at almost half the price of any other phone in its category. This attribute was well appreciated by reviewers at different websites and magazines. CNET.uk said in its review: "The music features are one of the most impressive aspects of the handset."   Many reviewers criticized the lack of Bluetooth, since it was a music phone, but acknowledged the high quality music output and the value for money. With such features, Sony Ericsson W200 has gone on to become one of the best selling Walkman phones.

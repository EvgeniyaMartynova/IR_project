Title: Bedford Y series
Aspects: {'Y series'}

The Bedford Y series was a family of single-decker bus and single-decker coach chassis manufactured by Bedford from 1970 to 1986, when Bedford ceased bus and truck production.


== History ==
Announced in September 1970, the Bedford YRQ was a 10-metre (33 ft) coach chassis intended to replace the Bedford VAM. The engine was mounted centrally under the floor.
In 1972 an 11-metre (36 ft) version, the YRT, entered production as a replacement for the twin-steer Bedford VAL.New more powerful engines were introduced in 1975 with the YLQ (10m) and YMT (11m).
The 1980 YNT was a development of the YMT with a turbocharged engine, while the YLQ became the YMQ and then the YMP.
The 12-metre YNV Venturer with air suspension was the final development of the Y series, announced in 1984.
Bus and truck production by Bedford ceased in 1986.


== Chassis summary ==
The Y series was produced in four different lengths; 8m, 10m, 11m and 12m.  The majority were bodied as coaches, though the 8m, 10m and 11m versions were also built as single-decker buses and midibuses.  Seating capacities varied, but were typically 45 for a 10m bus or coach and 53 for an 11m.  The 12m version was built almost exclusively as a coach, with one exception where a Plaxton Paramount coach body shell was fitted out with bus seats in a high-capacity layout.

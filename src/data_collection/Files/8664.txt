Title: Purranisaurus
Aspects: {'M. potens'}

Purranisaurus is an extinct genus of marine crocodyliform from the Middle to Late Jurassic period of Chile and Argentina. Rusconi originally regarded Purranisaurus potens (the type species) to be a plesiosaur; however, Gasparini demonstrated that it was in fact a metriorhynchid crocodyliform, and that may be a junior synonym of Metriorhynchus.


== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
In the 2000s phylogenetic analysis has shown that Purranisaurus is a distinct metriorhynchid genus. A subsequent study expanded the genus Purranisaurus to include Metriorhynchus casamiquelai and M. westermanni.


=== Valid species ===
P. casamiquelai: Middle Jurassic of Chile (Callovian);
P. westermanni: Middle Jurassic of Chile (Callovian). Although previously considered a junior synonym of P. casamiquelai, it has been revalidated.
P. potens: Late Jurassic (Tithonian) Vaca Muerta of Argentina

Title: China National Highway 104
Aspects: {'G104'}

China National Highway 104 (G104) runs from Beijing to Fuzhou via Jinan, Xuzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Taizhou.
It runs to approximately 2,390 km, and, on a map, runs southeast towards Nanjing and Hangzhou before turning south-southwest at Taizhou.
Leaving Beijing, it first runs as part of South Zhongzhou Road and is also known as Nanyuan Road (for being close to the Nanyuan area). However, it then diverts southwest and becomes the highway unto itself.

Title: Huperzia australiana
Aspects: {'H. australiana'}

Huperzia australiana is a species of small terrestrial plant, a firmoss or tassel fern, in the Lycopodiaceae (clubmoss) family.  It is native to Australia and New Zealand.


== Distribution and habitat ==
The plant occurs at sheltered sites in subalpine and subantarctic regions, in grasslands and around bogs, up to 2000 m above sea level.


== Description ==
Huperzia australiana has decumbent stems with densely tufted, erect branches up to 300 mm long, usually branched 2 or 3 times.  The leaves are crowded, appressed to spreading, 5–9 mm long, 0.5–1.5 mm wide in the middle and tapering to a point.  It reproduces vegetatively through the often numerous small bulbils which form along the stem.  The sporophylls are similar to the foliage leaves; no strobili are formed; the bright yellow, kidney-shaped sporangia are produced in the upper leaf axils.

Title: List of active Ukrainian Navy ships
Aspects: {'U937'}

This list of vessels used by Ukrainian Navy. It includes main naval ships and cutters which are in service or were recently unlisted in the Ukrainian Navy as well as the auxiliary fleet. As of December 2007, the Navy had 27 combat ships and cutters. Some 20 years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the main warships of the Ukrainian Navy are former Black Sea Fleet vessels that were designed and built in the Soviet Union.
Having several shipyards on its territory, the shipbuilding industry of Ukraine was mostly stalled after the fall of the Soviet Union. Following the Orange Revolution, on 9 August 2005 the Cabinet of Ukraine allocated some funding for the first major national program "Corvette" that was initiated by Minister of Defense Anatoliy Hrytsenko. The first warship-class built in the independent Ukraine was expected to produce its first vessel in 2016.As of 24 March 2014, all of the larger ships but one (the frigate Ukrainian frigate Hetman Sahaydachniy) of the Ukrainian Navy were captured by the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Some ships Russia returned to Ukraine. In 2015 Ukraine received 5 small  (7 and 11 meter aluminum) Willard Marine patrol boats; the original order was placed in 2013.

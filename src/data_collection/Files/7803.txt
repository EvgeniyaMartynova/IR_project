Title: Leonard James Rogers
Aspects: {'L. J. Rogers'}

Leonard James Rogers FRS (30 March 1862, Oxford, England, – 12 September 1933, Oxford, England) was a British mathematician who was the first to discover the Rogers–Ramanujan identity and Hölder's inequality, and who introduced Rogers polynomials. The Rogers–Szegő polynomials are named after him.
From 1888 to 1919 he was Professor of Mathematics at the Yorkshire College (then an external college of University of London), which very later became the University of Leeds in 1904.
He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1924. In the late 1920s, he published in the Mathematical Gazette four notes on geometrical problems, including on Malfatti's Problem.

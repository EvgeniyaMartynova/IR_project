Title: Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton album)
Aspects: {'A Christmas to Remember'}

Once Upon a Christmas is a collaborative studio album by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton. It was released on October 29, 1984, by RCA Records.


== Overview ==
The album was accompanied by a Christmas television special titled Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember, which originally aired on CBS on December 2, 1984 and has been rerun numerous times, though never issued on home video, DVD or Blu-ray despite public demand (bootleg copies have been produced in large quantities, however). A single, "The Greatest Gift of All" (No. 53 Country, No. 81 Pop, and No. 40 Adult Contemporary) was released from the album. In the United Kingdom, "Christmas Without You" was issued as the single. This album became one of the biggest Christmas albums of the 1980s and still sells today, with "A Christmas to Remember" played by U.S. radio stations and satellite radio during the Christmas holiday season. In the UK the BBC gives airplay to several of the tracks across its network during the Christmas period. In 1989, it was certified Double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. As of November 2017, the album has sold 1,012,500 copies in the Soundscan era (which started collating sales figures in 1991).

== Alternate version ==
In 1997, the album was released on the BMG Special Products label with a slightly altered track listing. The song order had been slightly rearranged and two songs had been omitted ("The Christmas Song" and "Silent Night"). However, Parton's 1982 recording "Hard Candy Christmas" was added, making a total of nine tracks.

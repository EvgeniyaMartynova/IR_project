Title: K-33 (Kansas highway)
Aspects: {'K33'}

K-33 is a 10.405-mile-long (16.745 km) north–south state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas. It is a two-lane expressway, linking K-68 in rural Franklin County (near Rantoul) to U.S. Route 56 (US-56) in Douglas County, just north of Wellsville. It provides an important link between US-56 and K-68 to Interstate 35 (I-35) in Wellsville.


== Route description ==
K-33 begins at an intersection with K-68 east of Ottawa in Franklin County and heads north on a two-lane road through rolling plains. Approximately four miles (6.4 km) north of this intersection, the route curves to the east momentarily before curving back to the north. Here, the highway intersects I-35 and US-50 at a diamond interchange. North of this interchange, K-33 enters the city of Wellsville. In Wellsville, the highway crosses the BNSF Railway. Continuing north, K-33 leaves Wellsville and Franklin County, and enters Douglas County. About two miles (3.2 km) after crossing the county line, the highway ends at an intersection with US-56 east of Baldwin City.K-33 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-33 does connect to the National Highway System at I-35/US-50 and at its northern terminus. 2017 Annual average daily traffic (AADT) on K-33 ranged from 1410 near the northern and southern terminus to 4870 between I-35/US-50 and Wellsville.


== History ==
K-33 was first designated a state highway in 1927 and went from US-73W and US-50S in Ottawa east then north to Wellsville, then northeastward to US-50 in Edgerton. By 1931 K-33's western terminus was extended southeastward to end at US-50S west of Waverly. By April 1936, US-50S was realigned onto K-33 from south of Ottawa to K-31 east of Waverly and K-68 was extended west on the old US-50S alignment from Ottawa to US-75 by Lyndon. At that time K-33 was truncated to end at US-50S and US-73W in Ottawa. Sometime between April 1933 and April 1936 US-73W was renumbered to US-59. On June 27, 1956, the AASHO Route Numbering Committee approved US-56 to be created. US-56 was routed over US-50 from Kansas City westward to US-59 then followed US-50N, which was eliminated. Also at this time US-50S was renumbered to US-50. By 1963 the section of I-35 from Ottawa to Kansas City was built and US-50 had been realigned to overlap I-35. By 1969, the overlap with K-68 was eliminated and K-33 was truncated to its current southern terminus.

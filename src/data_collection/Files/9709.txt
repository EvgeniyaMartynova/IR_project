The castle fell into ruin in the 18th century.

There is a wide circular staircase to the right of the main door, a small guardroom to the left and a stone fireplace in the left-hand chamber of the first floor. 
There is a circular shot hole cut into the stairs between the first and second floors. The roof houses a chemin de ronde around the gables, a high rectangular chimney crowned with twin lozenge-shaped flues and corbels which once supported a corner bartizan.

Aspects: {'K23'}

K-23 is a 199.117-mile-long (320.448 km) southâ€“north state highway in the U.S. State of Kansas. It starts as a continuation of Oklahoma State Highway 23 (SH-23) and it runs northward to U.S. Route 83 (US-83) and K-383 near Selden.


== Route description ==
K-23 begins its northerly journey at the Kansas-Oklahoma state line northwest of Forgan, Oklahoma, picking up northbound traffic from Oklahoma Highway 23. It traverses flat land with a few hills, passing near Meade Lake, then intersects U.S. Routes 54 and 160 in downtown Meade. After leaving Meade, it starts to traverse rolling hills until K-98, where the road levels out. K-23 intersects U.S. Route 56 on its way to Cimarron, where it junctions U.S. Routes 50 and 400. North of Cimarron, the route alternates between flat and hilly land through farmland. North of Cimarron, the route overlaps K-156 for five miles. After leaving  K-156, the highway turns back north, levels out and heads toward Dighton, the only city in Lane County. There it intersects K-96. North of Dighton the route intersects K-4, and the two routes briefly run concurrent. After leaving K-4, it travels north to Gove City, and continues to Grainfield, where it intersects I-70 and U.S. Route 40, where the three routes overlap for two miles before K-23 turns north again. North of Grainfield, rolling hills alternate with the flatter land. In Hoxie, U.S. Route 24 is intersected. North of Hoxie, the road intersects K-123, turns west, then intersects K-223. K-23 continues west until its northern terminus at U.S. Route 83 and K-383.

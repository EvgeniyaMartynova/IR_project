Title: Nevada County Air Park
Aspects: {'O17'}

Nevada County Air Park (ICAO: KGOO, FAA LID: GOO, formerly O17) is a county-owned public use airport in Nevada County, California, United States. The airport is located three nautical miles (6 km) east of the central business district of Grass Valley, California. It is also known as Nevada County Airport.Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned GOO by the FAA but has no designation from the IATA (which assigned GOO to an airport in Goondiwindi, Queensland, Australia).


== History ==
The air park was first built by local entrepreneur Errol MacBoyle in 1933 in order to fly gold mined by his Idaho-Maryland Mine Corporation to Mills Field now known as San Francisco International Airport and then driven to the San Francisco Mint.  The airport was closed down at the onset of World War II due in part to the government shutdown of mining operations along with the wartime ban on civilian flight within 150 miles of the coast of California.  The airport property was purchased from the MacBoyle estate by Charles Litton Sr. in 1955.  Litton had previously moved his company's engineering lab in 1953.  After acquiring the property, Litton spent $10,000 to repair the runway that had fallen into disrepair and partnered with local government and businesses through the Grass Valley Chamber of Commerce to reopen the airport and build an industrial park in order to attract new business to the region.  The airport was reopened in 1956 and renamed Loma Rica Airport.  The United States Forest Service and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection began utilizing the airport as a base for their wildfire air attack operations in 1958.  A major renovation took place in 1965 when the landing strip was lengthened to 4000 ft.  In 1994 a 3000 square foot terminal was added and the following year the landing strip was again extended.

Title: R28 (South Africa)
Aspects: {'R28'}

The R28 is a provincial route in South Africa that connects Krugersdorp with Vereeniging via Randfontein. The R28 used to connect with Pretoria, but that section of the road is now part of the N14.


== Route ==
The R28 begins at a 4-way intersection with the N14 national route and M47 Johannesburg Metropolitan Route north-east of Krugersdorp (midway between Krugersdorp And Muldersdrift). The R28 used to proceed north-east as the route to Pretoria, but that section of the road was given to the N14 national route between Pretoria and Springbok.
From there, the R28 goes south-west to intersect with the R24 Road from Roodepoort in Krugersdorp Central. After the R24 Junction, the R28 continues by way of a right turn at Main Reef Road, which is the next junction after the railway crossing. It goes south-west for 10 km before intersecting with the R41 from Roodepoort at Randfontein. They are one road for the next 1 km before the R41 splits from the R28 and goes west. The R28 continues to go south, where it meets the v-shaped R559 route.
Afterwards, it proceeds southwards to Westonaria (bypassing Westonaria Central to the east) and meets the N12 Moroka Bypass between Johannesburg south and Potchefstroom. After the N12 Junction, it goes south-east as Randfontein Road for about 30 km towards Sebokeng.
Next, the R28 crosses the N1 Kroonvaal Toll Route between Johannesburg and Kroonstad and enters Evaton, Emfuleni Local Municipality (South Of Orange Farm). Right after the off-ramp, it intersects with the R553 from Johannesburg and joins it going southwards as the Golden Highway, passing through western Sebokeng, for 9 kilometres up to the 4-way junction with the R54 road.
At the junction with the R54 road from Potchefstroom, the R28 stops co-signing with the R553 southwards and begins co-signing with the R54 eastwards towards Vereeniging, bypassing Vanderbijlpark. After 6 km, the R54 becomes its own road eastwards (Houtkop Road, bypassing Vereeniging Central), leaving the R28 as the south-easterly road to Vereeniging central (Boy Louw street). After crossing the R59 highway, the R28 becomes Beaconsfield Road, enters Vereeniging Central and ends at an intersection with the R82 (Voortrekker Street).

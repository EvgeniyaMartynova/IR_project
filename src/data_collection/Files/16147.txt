The station signed on in 1965 as WDAY-FM with a beautiful music format. On January 1, 1983, the station changed to a Top 40 format, and broadcast commercial-free for the first several months. It was owned by Forum Communications, along with WDAY 970 and WDAY-TV 6. For a period in the early 1990s, the station adopted a soft adult contemporary format and was renamed "Mix 93.7". It later reverted to the Y94 name, and was sold to James Ingstad of Fargo in 1996, and sold to Clear Channel in 2000, along with several other radio stations in the area.On September 28, 2006, the Clear Channel station cluster in Fargo (including WDAY-FM) was sold back to James Ingstad, including KDAM which signed on in 2002.

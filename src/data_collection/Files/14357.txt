Title: V5 engine
Aspects: {'V5'}

The V5 engine is a V form engine with five cylinders. GM's Oldsmobile division developed a V5 diesel in 1983 but never put it into production.  In 1997, Volkswagen introduced a 2.3L V5 gasoline engine for the Passat, along with later models of the Golf/Jetta and SEAT Toledo. This V5 engine was based on the existing VR6, designed in the late 1980s.

Volkswagen introduced the first "V5" engine, though this engine is actually a narrow-angle VR5 (i.e., an inline-V with a common head). The engine is derived from the VR6, and is thus a staggered 5 with three cylinders on one bank and two on the other.
Known for its tuneful warble as the revs rise, the V5 is especially popular with motor enthusiasts. Volkswagen's VR5 is a 2.3 litre gasoline engine descending directly from the older VR6 from which VW removed a cylinder, creating the first production block to use five cylinders in a V design which has a 15 degree angle. The first version, with 2.3 L capacity, was capable of 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) and had a maximum torque of 205 N⋅m (151 lb⋅ft). It was introduced in the Passat in 1997 and later that year in the Golf, as well as in the Bora (aka Jetta) and the SEAT Toledo in 1998 respectively. In 2000 the head was updated with 10 more valves, and was equipped with variable valve timing thus raising power to 170 PS (125 kW; 168 hp) and 220 N⋅m (162 lb⋅ft).


== Motorcycle use ==
Honda used a V5 in its MotoGP race bike, the RC211V for the 2002–2006 seasons. This is a 990 cc engine with an angle of 75.5 degrees.

He was the owner of a German discotheque called Griffin's, in the city of Baden-Baden.
His first release was the 7" single "I Hate the Music" in 1977, followed by "I'm in the Race" in 1978.
In 1979, he released "Spiderman" as his third single. Shortly thereafter, the 12" version was released and the song became a major club hit that year.
He had two other club hits between 1980 and 1981. The songs were "Step By Step", which was originally released on Electrola of Germany.

The following year Electrola issued "Inside Out", another up-tempo number. No American company opted to license it, yet it still received good club exposure.
After his music career, he was very successful with several restaurants in Baden-Baden, Achern, Prague, and San Diego.

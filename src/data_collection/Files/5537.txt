Title: I Believe in Music (album)
Aspects: {'I Believe in Music'}

I Believe in Music is the second album released by singer-songwriter and actor Mac Davis. It was released in 1972, although the title song had already charted in 1970. The title track went on to become a standard and was covered by many artists in the 1970s, including a top 30 pop hit by Gallery in 1972.
Music reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered many of the songs to be more suitable for the album than on radio, and said:
The next time around, Davis would give himself his big, splashy original tune 'Baby Don’t Get Hooked on Me,' thereby finally hitting the big time, but here he’s still finding his voice as a recording artist. He’s almost there, but the results are most interesting in how his versions of his older songs point the way at what was to come".

The title song became Davis's signature song. His hit "Baby Don't Get Hooked On Me" was released after this album debuted, later in 1972.

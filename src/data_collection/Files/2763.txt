Despite the positive comments from the judges, the band did not make it to the top 8 which received a lot of criticism, to which musician Ahsan Bari; who is associated with the show; replied that bands like Sikandar Ka Mandar and E Sharp "are beyond battles".


=== 2018-Present ===
E Sharp made a second appearance in the fourth season of Pepsi Battle of the Bands. They came with a new line-up and performed the song The Anthem of Shabana. Their performance received highly positive reviews from the judge and they became the only band in the entire show to advance through the next round without the shortlisting process.
They were competitors in the fourth season of Pepsi Battle of the Bands and finished in third place sharing the position with Islamabad based rock band  Black Hour   The decision to eliminate the band was heavily criticized both by critics and audiences. Maheen Sabeeh of The News International wrote regarding the band's elimination "You have to wonder what the judges were thinking. Black Hour and E Sharp certainly did play better, more so the latter one. Based on this performance alone (and the others they have delivered so far), it is a damn shame to see the unlikeliest candidates make it to the finals."  Similarly, S.K Pakistan of Parhlo called E-Sharp's exit from the show "a shock."

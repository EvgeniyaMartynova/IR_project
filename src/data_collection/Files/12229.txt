Title: BMW R69S
Aspects: {'R69'}

The R69S, R69US, and R69 are motorcycles, fitted with 594 cc boxer twin engines, that were manufactured by BMW in Munich, Germany.


== Production history ==
From 1955 to 1969, 15,347 of these 594 cc shaft-drive, opposed twin motorcycles were built. The 35 hp (26 kW) R69 was produced from 1955 to 1960, the 42 hp (31 kW) R69S was produced from 1960 to 1969, and the 42 hp R69US was produced from 1968 to 1969.
These models were designed as relatively high powered, high compression sport bikes, although the  Earles fork R69 and R69S came with sidecar lugs installed on the frames. These lugs were deleted from the telescopic fork "US" models. The low compression 30 hp (22 kW) R60/2, produced from 1955 to 1960, was designed primarily for sidecar use, though it was popularly used as a solo bike, along with the 30 hp R60US, which was produced between 1968 and 1969.
The sport-oriented R69S, R69US, and R69 succeeded the plunger-framed 1951 to 1955 R68, which had an engine very similar to that in the later R69.
The R69US models, with telescopic forks, which were used later on the BMW R-/5 series motorcycles, were introduced in the United States for the 1968 model year and then continued for 1969. Front and rear side reflectors, demanded by the U. S. Department of Transportation, were introduced only for the 1969 model year, along with a DOT sticker that was placed on the rear fender. The previous Earles fork continued to be offered during these years.
In June 1962, Cycle World magazine published a review of the R69S. Its initial and concluding paragraphs read:

== Speed record ==
In 1961 an English team [sic] of four riders used a considerably modified machine to set 12 and 24-hour average-speed records for both 750 cc and 1000 cc categories at Montlhéry, France. Modifications included a tuned engine with higher final drive ratio, a race-crouch riding position with race-style full fairing, and extra lights. The 1000 cc 24-hour achievement of 109.24 mph (175.80 km/h) endured until supassed by a Kawasaki Z1 in 1972 on the banked Daytona racetrack, at an average speed of 109.64 mph (176.45 km/h).

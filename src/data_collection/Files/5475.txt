Title: I Am the Night (album)
Aspects: {'I Am the Night'}

I Am the Night is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Pantera, released in 1985 through Metal Magic Records. The album was made available only on vinyl and cassette, with any subsequent CD releases being bootlegs transferred from the vinyl or tape originals.
Some of Pantera's faster and heavier influences are more apparent on I Am the Night, especially on the title track, "Valhalla" and "Down Below" (which was re-recorded for their next album Power Metal). Guitar solos took on character, hinting at Dimebag Darrell's later style. It was also the last album to feature lead singer Terry Glaze. The band made their second music video for the track "Hot and Heavy".

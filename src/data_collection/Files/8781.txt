Aspects: {'M. vulgaris'}

Monograptus is a genus of graptolites in the Order Graptoloidea. This particular genus is the last stage of the graptoloid evolution before its extinction in the early Devonian. A characteristic of the genus includes one uniserial stipe with very elaborate thecae. This particular genus contains large number of graptolite species and may not be monophyletic.


== Biostratigraphic significance ==
The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) has assigned the First Appearance Datum (FAD) of Monograptus uniformis as the defining biological marker for the start of the Lochkovian, 419.2 ± 3.2 million years ago, the earliest stage of the Devonian. ICS has assigned the FAD of Monograptus parultimus defining biological marker for the start of the Pridoli epoch, 423.0 ± 2.3 million years ago, of Monograptus turriculatus (together with the replacement of the brachiopod Eocoelia intermedia with E. curtisi) for the start of the Telychian, 438.5 ± 1.1 million years ago, and of Monograptus austerus sequens for the start of the Aeronian, 440.8 ± 1.2 million years ago, all stages of the Silurian.

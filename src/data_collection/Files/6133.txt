== Critical reception ==
The single generally received positive reviews. Amy Sciarretto from Popcrush gave 3.5 stars (out of 5) and said, "It’s a simple set of lyrical declarations that celebrate being upbeat and enjoying life. There’s a fair amount of studio treatment on the song, but that’s a given with any epic, expansive pop song in 2011. We wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a staple at NFL stadiums this fall and winter, too." Meena Rupani from Desihits said," The upbeat track is sure to be on repeat just like their other collaboration tracks have been. It seems Enrique Iglesias and Pitbull can do no wrong when they come together on a song." Robbie Daw from Idolator said,"Enrique’s new RedOne-produced song has all the musical makings of an anthem, while the singer himself actually packs more of a soulful, emotional punch with his vocals than we've heard on recent singles like “Dirty Dancer,” “I Like It” and “Tonight (I’m Lovin’ You).”Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the song 4 stars (out of 5) saying, "Enrique continues to channel the au courrant synths and chunky Euro beats combo that has kept him afloat over the past year. "It's my time, it's my life, I can do what I like/ For the price of a smile, I gotta take it to right," he certifies over a carnival cabaret of Rio de Janeiro proportions – and with another chart-friendly anthem under his belt, he certainly has reason to celebrate."

Title: Farman F.400
Aspects: {'F400'}

The Farman F 400 was a 1930s French three-seat cabin high-winged monoplane which was designed and built by Farman.


== Design and development ==
The Farman series "400" was a revolution for its builder because it had a thin, cantilever-constructed, high wing, with round edges, which could be dismounted for better storage and transportation.
The aeroplane had mixed construction. The fuselage was made of steel tubes, while the wings had a wood frame. The fuselage and the wings are both covered with plywood.
This version, the Farman F 402, had a Lorraine 5 Pb 5-cylinder radial engine of 110 hp (82 kW), but the plane in the picture had it changed for a 9-cylinder radial engine Salmson of 120 hp (89 kW).
The F 402 has an unusual feature, which is that the control stick hangs from the ceiling of the cockpit, and the rudder control is a vertical steering wheel.
The fuel tanks, which are placed inside the wings, have a capacity of 200 liters.
The landing gear structure is constructed of iron bars, which allows this plane to land "hardly" in short space.
This aircraft served, among other countries, in Spain, during the 1936-1939 civil war, on both sides.

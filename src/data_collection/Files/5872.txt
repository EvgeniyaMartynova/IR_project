"Don't Wanna Know" is a song by American pop rock band Maroon 5. It features additional vocals from American rapper Kendrick Lamar.

== Composition ==
"Don't Wanna Know" is written in the key of G major in common time with a shuffling tempo of 100 beats per minute. The song follows a chord progression of CMaj7 – D6 – Em7 – Bm/E, and Levine's vocals span from D4 to C6.


== Critical reception ==
Mike Wass of Idolator stated "there's nothing bloated or excessive about the finished product. In fact, this is a case of less is more. [Don't Wanna Know] freshens up Maroon 5's sound and goes HAM on the repetition (the cornerstone of hitmarking circa 2016) — all but guarantees the band a smash hit in the process. Kendrick's verse feels like an afterthought, but apart from that, this is hard to fault." Vulture's Halle Kiefer said "it'll be on the soundtrack to every car commercial, Target ad, and drunken breakup you flounder through for the next three months" and went on to say "Don't Wanna Know has a distinctly non-Maroon 5 sound, putting a breezy, bouncy, lighthearted spin on drinking to forget, and dancing to dull the pain of losing the one true connection you ever had."


== Commercial performance ==
"Don't Wanna Know" debuted at number 56 on October 29, 2016, and jumped to number 9 in its second week on November 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band's 12th top 10 hit peaking at number 6.

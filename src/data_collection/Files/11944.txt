Title: Buffet Crampon
Aspects: {'R13'}

Buffet Crampon is a French manufacturer of woodwind musical instruments, including oboes, flutes, saxophones, english horns and bassoons; however, the company is perhaps most famous for their clarinets, as Buffet is the brand of choice for many professionals.Buffet Crampon began manufacturing musical instruments in 1825 exclusively in France, but has since expanded their business to include production facilities in Germany and China as well.  Since the company's conception, Buffet Crampon has expanded to a worldwide market. Jérôme Perrod, Buffet Group's Chief Executive Officer, runs the Buffet Crampon, Besson, B&S, Antoine Courtois, Hans Hoyer, J. Keilwerth, Meinl Weston, Powell Flutes, Scherzer, and W. Schreiber brands.


== History ==
Denis Buffet-Auger, of the Buffet family of French musical instrument makers, began making quality clarinets in Paris, France in 1825. The company expanded under Jean-Louis Buffet and his wife Zoé Crampon and became known as Buffet Crampon. (Another family member, Auguste Buffet jeune, who worked with famous clarinetist Hyacinthe Klosé to develop the Boehm system for clarinet, had his own business separate from Buffet Crampon.)
In 1850, Buffet Crampon established its headquarters at Mantes-la-Ville. The company continued to expand its range and quality in instrument production, beginning saxophone production in 1866, and winning numerous awards. 
In 1877 Buffet acquired the Evette & Schaeffer Company and began to use that name as their instrument brand.  In 1908 Buffet began exporting instruments to the US.  In 1910 Buffet introduced the Apogee premium model saxophone, which had innovative keywork features that were later adapted by other manufacturers.  In 1918 Buffet began marketing their premium line instruments under their own name, while marketing lower grade instruments variously under the Evette & Schaeffer and Evette brands.  During the 1930s Buffet began outsourcing Evette & Schaeffer instruments to other manufacturers.In 1950, Buffet developed its famous R13 clarinet, an extremely popular professional-level clarinet. The company also began production of the Dynaction model saxophones that year, which would evolve into the Super Dynaction (1957) and the highly regarded S series (1973) models.  Buffet also became the leading distributor of student-grade instruments in Europe, marketing French and Italian made saxophones under their Evette & Schaeffer brand.  During the 1970s, the company's position in the student saxophone market collapsed in the face of competition from Yamaha, who offered higher quality and more up-to-date instruments, and lower cost East German, Czech, and Asian manufacturers. Their collapse in the student market accompanied a deteriorating position in the market for professional saxophones that led to their being discontinued in the mid-1980s.  In 2008 Buffet re-entered the saxophone market with their 400 model, sourced from China.In 1981, Buffet joined Boosey & Hawkes, which sold the French company to The Music Group in 2003. Two years later Buffet was bought by a French group. In 2006 Buffet Crampon acquired two brass instrument manufacturers, Antoine Courtois Paris and Besson. In 2008 Buffet Crampon acquired the Leblanc clarinet factory in La Couture-Boussey, Département of Eure, Haute-Normandie in France.  In 2010, Buffet acquired the Julius Keilwerth company of Germany, taking charge of distribution of their distinctive saxophones.   In 2014, Buffet introduced the professional level Senzo alto saxophone.  The Senzo, built in a co-operative arrangement between Buffet and Keilwerth facilities, marked the return of Buffet saxophone production to France for the first time since the mid-1980s.Recently, Buffet has made some efforts to protect the African Blackwood trees, which provide grenadilla wood for clarinets, from being eliminated by introducing some wood composite products to its line up.   However, Buffet has decided not to adopt the Forest Stewardship Council's standard of sustainable forestry management.  Buffet composite wood models do not have the grain structure of a true wood product and as such they do not have the issue of cracking due to environmental changes that are typically seen in clarinets and other wood instruments.


=== Evette and Evette & Schaeffer clarinets ===
Until the 1980s, only professional level clarinets carried the Buffet name. Lower priced clarinets for the beginner and intermediate market were branded "Evette" and "Evette & Schaeffer", respectively. For a time, the Evette clarinets actually were built by other manufacturers under Buffet's sponsorship, and these instruments are marked "Evette sponsored by Buffet". By the early 1970s, Buffet was making the Evettes in their own factory in Paris, and around 1979, manufacture was moved to a Buffet-owned factory in Germany. Evette & Schaeffer clarinets were made in Paris. Use of the Evette and Evette & Schaeffer brands ended around 1985, when the company began using the Buffet name on all its clarinets.


== Clarinet models ==
Buffet Crampon has released several clarinet models from the mid-20th century onwards, with models ranging from student to professional in marketing. The development of new models has sometimes led to the discontinuation of older models. The student models tend to be made from ABS resin, whereas intermediate and professional models are usually made from grenadilla wood. The professional models are usually made from more select grenadilla wood, and are usually unstained. Various options have been made available for select professional models, including the Greenline option, additional keywork, and gold-plated keys.

== Flute models ==
Originally Buffet Crampon flutes were made in Paris, France.  But in 1981 the company was bought out by Boosey & Hawkes and their flutes were manufactured in Boosey & Hawkes factories in England (and later in Germany) over the period 1981 to 2004.  In 2005 the Buffet Crampon company returned to French hands. In 2016 Buffet Crampon purchased Powell Flutes, Maynard, Massachusetts, which continues as a separate brand.
Modern Buffet Crampon flutes utilize the Cooper scale (see Albert Cooper) and have a reputation for accurate tuning.  The 200 series flutes were of average construction quality and needed regular maintenance to play well.  In the 1980s Boosey & Hawkes redesigned the Buffet Crampon flute as the 6000 series with improved key cups and stiffer keys.  The 6000 series is generally regarded as mechanically superior to the 200 instruments.

== Saxophone models ==
As early as 1866, Buffet Crampon was producing its first saxophones, 20 years after the invention of this instrument by the Belgian Adolphe Sax. They were the first to manufacture saxophones, besides those made by Adolphe Sax himself. Today, Buffet Crampon produces three series of saxophones: 100 Series, 400 Series and since 2013, the Senzo alto saxophone.

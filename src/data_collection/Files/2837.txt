Title: Eremobates
Aspects: {'E. affinis'}

Eremobates is a genus of arachnids of the order Solifugae. About 2 inches long, this fast-moving arachnid has the largest jaw size to body ratio of any animal. It is not venomous, but has a remarkably powerful bite. Often hunting at night, it has poor eyesight and navigates mostly by use of a pair of pedipalps.
They are solitary creatures, coming together only to mate, the male using his pedipalps to transfer seminal fluid to the female, who buries between 50 and 200 eggs in the ground. The female stays with the young until they are mature enough to hunt and defend themselves, feeding and caring for them.
Eremobates are generally found in western United States of America, and at northern end into southwestern Canada, and south into Mexico.
The genus Eremobates contains the following species:

Title: Yalong River
Aspects: {'Yalong'}

The Yalong River (Chinese: 雅砻江, p Yǎlóngjiāng, w Ya-lung Chiang, IPA [jàlʊ̌ŋ tɕjàŋ]) or Nyag Chu (Tibetan: ཉག་ཆུ་, z Nyag Qu) is an 822-mile (1,323 km) long river in Sichuan province in southwestern China. It is a tributary of the Yangtze River. Its source is on the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau in southeast Qinghai, and its confluence with the Yangtze is in Panzhihua in southwestern Sichuan.  Along its route, the Yalong travels between the Shaluli Mountains to the west and the Daxue Mountains to the east.  In Liangshan Prefecture, the river wraps 150 km (93 mi) around the Jinping Mountains creating the Jinping Bend.  Here, water from the Yalong River has been diverted under the mountains as part of the Jinping-II Dam hydroelectric project.

Title: F-distribution
Aspects: {'F-ratio (disambiguation)'}

In probability theory and statistics, the F-distribution, also known as Snedecor's F distribution or the Fisher–Snedecor distribution (after Ronald Fisher and George W. Snedecor) is a continuous probability distribution that arises frequently as the null distribution of a test statistic, most notably in the analysis of variance (ANOVA), e.g., F-test.


== Definition ==
If a random variable X has an F-distribution with parameters d1 and d2, we write X ~ F(d1, d2). Then the probability density function (pdf) for X is given by

== Characterization ==
A random variate of the F-distribution with parameters d1 and d2 arises as the ratio of two appropriately scaled chi-squared variates:

  
    
      
        X
        =
        
          
            
              
                U
                
                  1

    {\displaystyle X={\frac {U_{1}/d_{1}}{U_{2}/d_{2}}}}
  where

U1 and U2 have chi-squared distributions with d1 and d2 degrees of freedom respectively, and
U1 and U2 are independent.In instances where the F-distribution is used, for example in the analysis of variance, independence of U1 and U2 might be demonstrated by applying Cochran's theorem.
Equivalently, the random variable of the F-distribution may also be written

  where s12 and s22 are the sums of squares S12 and S22 from two normal processes with variances σ12 and σ22 divided by the corresponding number of χ2 degrees of freedom, d1 and d2 respectively :

  .In a frequentist context, a scaled F-distribution therefore gives the probability p(s12/s22 | σ12, σ22), with the F-distribution itself, without any scaling, applying where σ12 is being taken equal to σ22.  This is the context in which the F-distribution most generally appears in F-tests: where the null hypothesis is that two independent normal variances are equal, and the observed sums of some appropriately selected squares are then examined to see whether their ratio is significantly incompatible with this null hypothesis.
The quantity X has the same distribution in Bayesian statistics, if an uninformative rescaling-invariant Jeffreys prior is taken for the prior probabilities of σ12 and σ22. In this context, a scaled F-distribution thus gives the posterior probability p(σ22/σ12|s12, s22), where now the observed sums s12 and s22 are what are taken as known.

It is endemic to the Central African Republic and is only known from its type locality, Bouala (originally spelled "Buala"), at 998 m (3,274 ft) above sea level on the Ouham River.

Phrynobatrachus nanus is the type species of the genus Pararthroleptis Ahl, 1925 "1923". However, the genus is currently considered a synonym of Phrynobatrachus.

Aspects: {'UAF'}

Uganda Athletic Federation (UAF) is an IAAF recognised member officially representing Uganda as the national governing body for the sport of Athletics.


== History ==
The country of Uganda gained independence in 1962.  A mere ten years later, they proudly achieved their first Olympic Gold Medal when John Akii-Bua took the 400 metres hurdles in world record time.  Ugandan women athletes have made their mark as well, Dorcus Inzikuru was the winner of the first Women's 3000 metres steeplechase world championship.  Stephen Kiprotich doubled that success, winning the Olympic gold medal in the marathon and backing it up a year later with the World Championship.

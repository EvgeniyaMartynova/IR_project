Title: Parthian-class submarine
Aspects: {'P-class submarine'}

The Parthian-class submarine or P class was a class of six submarines built for the Royal Navy in the late 1920s. They were designed as long-range patrol submarines for the Far East.  These boats were almost identical to the Odin class, the only difference being a different bow shape.

Title: Yama (Hinduism)
Aspects: {'Yama (disambiguation)'}

In Hinduism, Yama (Sanskrit: यम:) - also referred to as Yamaraja - is a Rigvedic deity. He the lord of death and of justice, being responsible for the dispensation of law and punishment of sinners in his abode, Yamaloka.


== Characteristics ==

In Vedic tradition, Yama was considered to be the first mortal who died and espied the way to the celestial abodes; thus, as a result, he became the ruler of the departed. His role, characteristics, and abode have been expanded in texts such as the Upanishads and Puranas.
His name means 'twin' (Yama has a twin sister, Yami), 'moral rule or duty' (i.e. dharma), 'self-control', 'forbearance', and 'cessation'.
One of the Lokapāla - Guardians of the Directions - representing the south cardinal direction.
Depicted as riding a water-buffalo and holding a danda (meaning 'stick', also referring to Vedic punishment) as a weapon.
Skin colour is often depicted as blue, but also sometimes as red.
Often related to Kāla ("time") since all must die in due course (Krishna and Shiva are considered to be the personifications of time).
Analogous to Hades (also known as Pluto, another meaning of 'Yama'), the Greek god of the underworld.

== Literature ==


=== Vedas (Rig Veda) ===
In the Rig Veda, Yama is the son of  Vivasvan (the sun god, son of Kashyapa) and of Saranya (the dusk goddess, daughter of Tvastar) and has a twin sister named Yami. He helped humankind find a place to dwell, and gave every individual the power to tread any path in life which he or she so chooses.Yama is mentioned roughly fifty times in the Rig Veda, almost exclusively in the first and (far more frequently) in the tenth book. Four hymns (10.10, 10.14, 10.135, and 10.154) are directly addressed to or about Yama. From the Griffith / Keith / Fergus translation:

1. Honour the King with thine oblations, Yama, Vivasvat's son, who gathers men together, | who travelled to the lofty heights above us, who searches out and shows the path to many, | 2. Yama first found for us a place to dwell in: this pasture never can be taken from | us. | Men born on earth tread their own paths that lead them whither our ancient Fathers have departed.

6. When the funeral gift was placed, straightaway the point of flame appeared. | A depth extended in the front: a passage out was made behind. || 7. Here is the seat where Yama dwells, that which is called the Home of Gods: Here minstrels blow the flute for him here he is glorified with songs.

4. Yea, the first followers of the Law, Law's pure and holy strengtheners, | The Fathers, Yama! Fervour-moved, even to those let him depart. || 5. Skilled in a thousand ways and means, the sages who protect the Sun, | the Rishis, Yama! Fervour-Moved, - even to those let him depart.

Hymn 10.10 consists of prayer by Yama's sister, Yami, to him. Agni, the god of fire, has close relations with Yama. In hymn 10.21, Agni is said to be the envoy of Vivasvat (Yama's father) and a well-loved friend (kāmya) of Yama himself:

5. Skilled in all lore is Agni, he whom erst Arthavan brought to life. | He was Vivasta's envoy, at your glad carouse - the well-loved friend of Yama, Thou art waxing great.

Hymn 10.52, asks who Yama's priest is:

3. Who is the priest? Is he the priest of Yama? On whom is thrust this God-appointed honour?... || 4. The Gods have made me bearer of oblations, who slipped away and passed through many troubles. | Wise Agni shall ordain for us the worship, whether five-wayed, threefold, or seven-threaded.

Hymn 1.164 states Agni, Yama, and Mātariśvan are the names of One being, along with other forms of the divine:

46. They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutman. | To what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, Matarisvan.


=== Upanishads ===
In the Katha Upanishad, Yama is portrayed as a teacher to the Brahmin boy Nachiketa. Having granted three boons to Nachiketa, their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of being, knowledge, the Atman (i.e. the soul, self) and moksha (liberation). From the translation by Brahmrishi Vishvatma Bawra:

Yama says: I know the knowledge that leads to heaven. I will explain it to you so that you will understand it. O Nachiketas, remember this knowledge is the way to the endless world; the support of all worlds; and abides in subtle form within the intellects of the wise.


=== Mahabharata ===

In the epic Mahabharata, Yama is the father of Yudhishthira (also known as Dharmaraja), the oldest brother of the five Pandavas. Yama most notably appears in person in the  Yaksha Prashna and the Vana Parva, and is mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. 


==== Yaksha Prashna ====
In the Yaksha Prashna, Yama appears as a yaksha (nature spirit) in the form of a Crane to question Yudhishthira and test his righteousness. Impressed by Yudhishthira's strict adherence to dharma and his answers to the riddles posed, Yama revealed himself as his father, blessed him, and brought his younger Pandava brothers back to life. From the Yaksha Prashna article linked:

The Yaksha [Yama] asked, "What enemy is invincible? What constitutes an incurable disease? What sort of man is noble and what sort is ignoble"? And Yudhishthira responded, "Anger is the invincible enemy. Covetousness constitutes a disease that is incurable. He is noble who desires the well-being of all creatures, and he is ignoble who is without mercy".


==== Vana Parva ====
In the Vana Parva, when Yudhishthira asks the sage Markandeya whether there has ever been a woman whose devotion matched Draupadi’s, the sage replied by relating the story of Savitri and Satyavan. After Savitri's husband Satyavan died, Yama arrived to carry away his soul. However, Yama was so impressed with Savitri's purity and dedication to dharma and to her husband, he was convinced to instead bring Satyavan back to life.


===== Tirtha-Yatra Parva =====

In the Tirtha-yatra Parva (Book 3, Varna Parva, CXLII), Lomasa tells Yudhishthira 'in days of yore, there was (once) a terrible time in the Krita Yuga when the eternal and primeval Deity [Krishna] assumed the duties of Yama. And, O thou that never fallest off, when the God of gods began to perform the functions of Yama, there died not a creature while the births were as usual.'
This led to an increase in the population and the Earth sinking down 'for a hundred yojanas. And suffering pain in all her limbs.' The earth sought the protection of Narayana, who incarnated as a boar (Varaha) and lifted her back up.


==== Udyoga Parva ====
In the Udyoga Parva, it is stated that the wife of Yama is called Urmila.


==== Bhagavad Gita ====
In the Bhagavad Gita, part of the Mahabharata, Krishna states:

Of the celestial Naga snakes I am Ananta; of the aquatic deities I am Varuja. Of departed ancestors I am Aryama and among the dispensers of law I am Yama, lord of death.


=== Puranas ===
Yama and his abode are frequently mentioned in the Puranas.


==== Bhagavata Puruna / Srimad Bhagavatam ====


===== Third and Fourth Canto =====
In the third and fourth cantos of the Srimad Bhagavatam, Yama was incarnated as a shudra called Vidura due to being cursed by a sage for being too harsh in his punishments. From the A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada / Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (BBT) translation:
As long as Vidura played the part of a śūdra, being cursed by Maṇḍūka Muni [also known as Māṇḍavya Muni], Aryamā officiated at the post of Yamarāja to punish those who committed sinful acts.

Vidura, a devotee of Krishna, is the main protagonist in the third canto. In this canto, after being thrown out of his home by King Dhritarashtra (his older half-brother) for admonishing the Kaurava's ignoble behaviour towards the Pandavas, Vidura went on a pilgrimage where he met other devotees of Krishna such as Uddhava and the sage Maitreya, the latter of whom revealed Vidura's true origin to him:

I know that you are now Vidura due to the cursing of Māṇḍavya Muni and that formerly you were King Yamarāja, the great controller of living entities after their death. You were begotten by the son of Satyavatī, Vyāsadeva, in the kept wife of his brother.

Krishna also states Yama punishes sinners, as relayed to Vidura (again, an incarnation of Yama) by Maitreya during their conversation about the origin and creation of the multiverse:

The brahmanas, the cows and the defenceless creatures are My [Krishna's] own body. Those whose faculty of judgement has been impaired by their own sin look upon those as distinct from Me. They are just like furious serpents, and they are angrily torn apart by the bills of the vulturelike messengers of Yamaraja, the superintendent of sinful persons.

A detailed account of the punishment of a sinner upon their death is also provided, beginning with their seizure and journey to Yamaloka (i.e. Hell): 

As a criminal is arrested for punishment by the constables of the state, a personal engaged in criminal sense gratification is similarly arrested by the Yamadutas, who bind him by the neck with a strong rope and cover his subtle body so that he may undergo severe punishment. While carried by the constables of Yamaraja, he is overwhelmed and trembles in their hands. While passing on the road [to Yamaloka] he is bitten by dogs, and he can remember the sinful activities of his life. He is thus terribly distressed.


===== Sixth Canto =====
In the sixth canto, Yama (not as Vidura nor with Aryama in the post; see third and fourth canto) instructs his messengers, the Yamadutas, when questioned about who has supreme authority in the universe since there are so many gods and demigods:

Yamarāja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but factually I am not. Above me, and above all the other demigods, including Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller. The partial manifestations of His personality are Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva, who are in charge of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe. He is like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth. The entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in its nose.


===== Tenth Canto =====
In the tenth canto, Krishna and Balarama travel to Yama's abode to bring back the dead son of their Guru, Sandipani Muni:


==== Brahma Purana ====

Chapter 105: Descriptions of the 'terrible servants of Yama' are given
Chapter 126.42.50: Descriptions of the agony of death for sinners including being caught by Yama with His noose, and the tortures suffered in His abode
Chapter 24 (book 4): Yama is killed in battle by Karttikeya; on Shiva's orders, Yama is revived by NandinRiding on his terrible buffalo, the god of Death Yama hastened to that place. He was holding his sceptre (rod of chastisement). His physical body was yellow in colour. In prowess he was comparable to none. He was unparalled in brilliance, strength and power of demanding obedience. His limbs were well developed and he wore garlands.


==== Garuda Purana ====

In art, some Sanskrit sources say that he should be of dark color, resembling the rain-cloud, with two arms, fire-colored eyes and sharp side-tusks. He is depicted with red or black clothes, and seated either on a throne or a he-buffalo.  A different iconographic form described in the Viṣṇudharmottara depicts him with four arms and wearing golden yellow garments. He holds a noose (pāśa) of rope in one hand. He is also depicted holding a danda which is a Sanskrit word for "stick".
